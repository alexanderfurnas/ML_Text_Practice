HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:10.010 --> 00:11.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I don't think it's anybody's
business if I

00:11.645 --> 00:13.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to send money to the vets.

00:13.580 --> 00:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Responding to
media scrutiny,
Donald Trump accounts for the
nearly $6 million

00:17.818 --> 00:20.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he raised to benefit veterans
groups.

00:20.320 --> 00:25.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: More than 1,000
migrants lost
their lives attempting to cross
the Mediterranean

00:25.092 --> 00:29.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just last week, marking a surge
in journeys
as the weather turns warmer.

00:29.930 --> 00:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Brazil's favelas become
the stage for
bold policing experiments aiming
to push out

00:35.535 --> 00:37.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violent drug gangs before the
Olympics.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIO ANDRADA, Communications
Director, Rio
2014: We don't want the Games to
be an island

00:40.841 --> 00:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of success and perfection. We
want the Games
to transform Rio, and to make
Rio a safer

00:47.748 --> 00:49.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
city in the years to come.

00:49.716 --> 00:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.090 --> 00:59.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.893 --> 01:09.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Republicans' presidential
nominee-to-be declared today
that, when it

01:09.036 --> 01:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes to veterans, he has indeed
put his money
where his mouth is.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

01:15.075 --> 01:21.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was
something relatively
rare for Donald Trump, going on
the defensive,

01:21.081 --> 01:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he held a news conference at
his New York
hotel.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I have raised a tremendous
amount of money

01:26.086 --> 01:30.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the vets, almost $6 million,
and more
money is going to come in, I
believe, over

01:30.123 --> 01:35.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next little while, too, but
I have raised
almost $6 million. All of the
money has been

01:35.128 --> 01:40.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid out. I have never received
such bad publicity
for doing such a good job.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This goes back
to January,
when Trump boasted about a
fund-raiser he

01:44.538 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
held for veterans while
boycotting a Republican
debate.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We just cracked $6
million,
right?

01:49.876 --> 01:51.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:51.678 --> 01:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, for
months, reporters
have asked for proof and
specifics. Today,

01:55.716 --> 02:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump revealed where that money
went, an array
of more than 40 organizations,
from work with

02:00.687 --> 02:03.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
service dogs to scholarships for
families.

02:03.657 --> 02:08.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he quickly turned to going
on attack against
journalists covering the story.

02:08.362 --> 02:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have to tell
you, the press
is so dishonest. This sleazy guy
right over

02:15.369 --> 02:17.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here from ABC, he's a sleaze.

02:17.504 --> 02:21.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: It seems as though
you're resistant
to scrutiny, the kind of
scrutiny that comes

02:21.708 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with running for president of
the United States.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.711 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:24.745 --> 02:26.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But you know what?
When I raise
money...

02:26.413 --> 02:27.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:27.347 --> 02:29.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You raise money for
veterans.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse
me. I have
watched you on television.
You're a real beauty.

02:31.018 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump did get
some supportive
words today from the top
Republican in the

02:34.488 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Senate, Mitch McConnell.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
Well, I think Donald Trump is a
phenomenon.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Really? You don't think
our party changed
their views on those issues?

02:40.327 --> 02:44.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Look, I
haven't changed
my views. And I don't believe
Donald Trump

02:44.831 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is going to change the
Republican Party in
any fundamental way. My view is
that Trump

02:48.235 --> 02:52.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has earned the nomination
because he went
out and got the most votes. And
we need to

02:52.172 --> 02:57.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be respectful of the electoral
process that
has produced this nominee.

02:57.577 --> 03:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Democrats were
all offense and metaphor in
California. Bernie

03:03.583 --> 03:08.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders showed up to support the
Golden State
Warriors in their must-win and
did-win NBA

03:08.922 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playoff game last night. He
tweeted: "Last
week, Golden State was down
three games to

03:13.760 --> 03:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one. Tonight, they finished off
a great comeback
in California. I like
comebacks."

03:19.066 --> 03:25.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in San Francisco, Sanders
was surrounded
by nurses, one of his biggest
sources of union

03:25.505 --> 03:27.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support, as he talked health
care.

03:27.474 --> 03:31.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
How can we be satisfied when 28
million people

03:31.311 --> 03:34.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this country today have zero
health insurance?

03:34.047 --> 03:39.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary
Clinton's offense?
It came from California Governor
Jerry Brown,

03:39.086 --> 03:44.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who surprised many by endorsing
her today,
a big coup for the front-runner,
who has changed

03:44.124 --> 03:47.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her travel schedule to focus
more on the Golden
State.

03:47.794 --> 03:51.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the candidate herself
stopped short of
predicting victory in
California. She spoke

03:51.898 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by phone to MSNBC.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I'm feeling very positive
about my campaign

03:57.237 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in California. We are working
really hard.

04:00.207 --> 04:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton is now
71 delegates
away from clinching the
nomination.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The State Department put out a
fresh warning

04:11.485 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Americans traveling in Europe
this summer:
Watch out for terrorist attacks.

04:15.856 --> 04:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department spokesman John
Kirby said
there's no specific threat, but
major upcoming

04:19.493 --> 04:21.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
events could be targets.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, State Department
Spokesman: We
took the opportunity, since it's
the beginning

04:23.697 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of summer, to make -- to make
our concerns
known about the potential risk
to -- of terrorist

04:32.873 --> 04:36.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks throughout Europe,
particularly when
you have got the Tour de France
starting up,

04:36.543 --> 04:42.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have got this European
football championship,
and, of course, Youth -- World
Youth Day,

04:42.849 --> 04:45.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of which is happening in
June and July.

04:45.385 --> 04:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The alert is
an extension
of one that was issued after the
March terrorist

04:49.723 --> 04:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks in Brussels. Now it will
run through
the end of August.

04:53.326 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elite Iraqi forces held off a
fierce counterattack
by Islamic State militants in
Fallujah today.

04:59.566 --> 05:03.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Government troops began
advancing into the
city yesterday, trying to end
two years of

05:03.236 --> 05:08.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS control. Today's fighting
erupted on
the southern edge of Fallujah.
ISIS fighters

05:08.208 --> 05:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used tunnels, snipers and car
bombs in an
attack that lasted about four
hours. An estimated

05:13.847 --> 05:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50,000 people are trapped in the
city. The
U.N. Refugee Agency says ISIS is
using some

05:19.119 --> 05:20.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as human shields.

05:20.954 --> 05:26.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, heavy airstrikes
blasted a pair
of hospitals in the northern
city of Idlib.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Activists put the death toll at
23 and likely
to rise.

Diana Magnay of Independent
Television News
reports.

05:32.866 --> 05:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: In the mayhem of
rescue, after
a series of airstrikes on this
civilian neighborhood

05:39.573 --> 05:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Idlib, a moment's relief for
a life spared,
a little boy, his eyes wide with
fear, his

05:50.383 --> 05:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world changed suddenly by the
savagery of
a bomb.

05:55.989 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
Russian warplanes
make several airstrikes on
Idlib. We can't

06:04.030 --> 06:08.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell yet how many are dead or
injured. We
know there are dozens.

06:08.268 --> 06:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA MAGNAY: Russia says there
wasn't them,
but Idlib is in rebel hands, and
only Russia

06:14.074 --> 06:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the regime have airpower.
Whoever it was,
they hit two hospitals.

06:18.378 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bombing of hospitals in
Syria is now happening
so often, it's almost
commonplace. February's

06:25.185 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cessation of hostilities seems
meaningless
now, Russian and regime
warplanes still a

06:30.624 --> 06:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feature of Syria's skies, and,
on the ground,
rescue workers busy saving
whoever and whatever

06:37.330 --> 06:39.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they can.

06:39.165 --> 06:41.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
the White
House condemned the hospital
attacks and said,

06:41.768 --> 06:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the international community
needs to get to
the bottom of this.

06:44.604 --> 06:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea's latest attempt to
launch a ballistic
missile failed today. It's the
fourth failure

06:48.942 --> 06:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since April. U.S. and South
Korean officials
said the intermediate-range
missile could

06:53.313 --> 06:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the range to reach Japan or
Guam. The
U.S., South Korea, Japan and
China all condemned

06:58.985 --> 07:00.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the North's actions.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, stocks
struggled to
make much headway today. The Dow
Jones industrial

07:04.758 --> 07:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 86 points to close
at 17787.
The Nasdaq rose 14 points, but
the S&amp;P 500

07:11.298 --> 07:13.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dropped two.

07:13.166 --> 07:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's leading
to a spike in migrant deaths;
Brazil's efforts

07:17.871 --> 07:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to eradicate gang violence ahead
of the Olympics;
Texas braces for record
flooding; and much

07:23.610 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Summer in the Mediterranean used
to be marked
by Northern Europeans and
Americans flocking

07:38.224 --> 07:42.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to beaches on holiday. But for
the past few
years, warm weather in the
region has meant

07:42.729 --> 07:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rise in desperate migrants
taking a deadly
journey.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 1,000 migrants have
been killed
trying to cross the
Mediterranean Sea in the

07:50.503 --> 07:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last week. According to the
U.N., it's one
of the highest weekly death
tolls since the

07:55.141 --> 08:00.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis began in 2014.

08:00.380 --> 08:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scenes of desperation in the
heart of the
Mediterranean. Over the past
week, rescuers

08:05.018 --> 08:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have scrambled dozens of times
to reach struggling
vessels large and small
overflowing with migrants.

08:11.391 --> 08:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A survivor from Eritrea who
chose not to give
his name says he never imagined
the danger.

08:16.563 --> 08:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): All my
friends told
me it wasn't easy, don't try to
go. But I

08:21.735 --> 08:26.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't believe them. Now I
believe them. It's
very bad. But it would have been
the same

08:26.706 --> 08:30.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for me, because if I stayed in
my country,
I would have been dead.

HARI SREENIVASAN: This latest
unfolding disaster
off Libya is the newest chapter
in Europe's

08:35.849 --> 08:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migrant drama. The U.N. Refugee
Agency reports
that, so far this year, some
2,500 people

08:42.722 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have died trying to reach the
continent. That's
up from about 1,800 in the same
time last

08:47.761 --> 08:49.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM SPINDLER, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: This highlights
the importance

08:51.498 --> 08:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of rescue operations as part of
the response
to the movement of refugees and
migrants in

08:54.567 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Mediterranean, and the need
for real,
safer alternatives for people
needing international

08:59.806 --> 09:01.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protection.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Most of the
deaths have
come on the route from North
Africa to Italy,

09:04.477 --> 09:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the odds of being killed
are as high
as one in 23. The victims come
in all sizes.

09:11.584 --> 09:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The humanitarian organization
Sea Watch released
this photo yesterday of a baby
who drowned

09:16.790 --> 09:18.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off the coast of Libya.

09:18.758 --> 09:23.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBEN NEUGEBAUER, Sea-Watch
(through translator):
If we as a European community
don't want to

09:23.229 --> 09:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see such photos, we must stop
producing them.
The European Union uses the
Mediterranean

09:27.967 --> 09:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a sort of graveyard, where
boats filled
with corpses are used to scare
those who are

09:32.539 --> 09:35.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still living and would maybe
want to follow.

09:35.275 --> 09:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Aid officials
also say the
rising death toll suggests
smuggling gangs

09:39.879 --> 09:42.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are using even riskier tactics
than before.

09:42.949 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, prosecutors in Sicily
announced the
arrests of 16 suspected
smugglers. They were

09:48.254 --> 09:52.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on board a boat carrying nearly
900 people
who were rescued over the
weekend.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELANGELO PATANE, Prosecutor
(through translator):
These smugglers make remarkable
profits. If

09:56.863 --> 10:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we consider the great number of
migrants they
manage to squeeze into those
vessels, the

10:01.401 --> 10:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earnings are substantial,
especially compared
to the low value of a dinghy and
the value

10:05.872 --> 10:07.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a low-power engine.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some survivors
say Libyan
smugglers appear to be trying to
earn extra

10:11.711 --> 10:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cash before the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan,
when daytime fasting may curtail
sailings.

10:18.051 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the human flow
between Turkey and
Greece has dropped sharply. In
march, ®MDNM /Ankara

10:23.690 --> 10:28.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
signed an agreement with the
European Union
to stem illegal migration.

10:28.228 --> 10:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined now
by David
Miliband, CEO of International
Rescue Committee.

10:32.432 --> 10:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, why is this happening?
Why this surge
that we're seeing in the last
couple of weeks?

10:36.970 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND, Former British
Foreign Secretary:
I think there are two main
reasons that explain

10:40.106 --> 10:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this terrible, horrific wave of
death in the
Mediterranean from North Africa.

10:46.212 --> 10:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is the increasingly
desperate tactics
of the smugglers themselves. I
think that

10:51.484 --> 10:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the official who just spoke
about their tactics
got it absolutely right. These
are desperate

10:56.489 --> 11:00.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people and they're being
exploited by smuggling
gangs.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing, obviously, is
that, as the
weather has got better over the
last couple

11:03.596 --> 11:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of months, the number of people
flowing from
North Africa into Italy has
grown. About 50,000,

11:09.369 --> 11:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
46,000, to be precise, have come
into Europe
from North Africa this year.

11:14.407 --> 11:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although this crisis doesn't
get much
attention to the Syrian crisis,
the people

11:19.312 --> 11:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Africa are coming from
Nigeria, from
Somalia, from Gambia, from Cote
d'Ivoire,

11:23.816 --> 11:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Eritrea, like the man in
the film. And
you are therefore seeing that
this is a global

11:28.454 --> 11:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugee and migration crisis,
not just a Syrian
crisis.

11:31.858 --> 11:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But could this
be a bigger
wave, considering all of those
countries that

11:36.396 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you just listed?

11:38.231 --> 11:43.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, we know
that the world
is experiencing the biggest wave
of refugees

11:43.369 --> 11:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since the Second World War.
Twenty million
people are refugees at the
moment. That means

11:47.840 --> 11:53.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're fleeing their countries
of their homeland
as a result of violence and
conflict; 40 million

11:53.613 --> 11:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are displaced within
their own countries.

11:56.883 --> 12:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We as an international aid
organization are
working in all of these fragile
and conflict

12:02.889 --> 12:08.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, be they in Africa or in
the Middle
East. And we know, to our cost,
that the amount

12:08.261 --> 12:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of need far outstrips the
ability of the system
to respond, and that's why we
say there doesn't

12:13.933 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just need to be more money going
to international
humanitarian aid. There needs to
be a new

12:17.737 --> 12:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach to the way refugees are
handled and
dealt with, not least to prevent
the appalling

12:22.842 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loss of life that's taken place
on the shores
of Europe.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some part of
this has to
do with the fact that the route
has changed

12:29.449 --> 12:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, and the deal that Turkey
struck with
the E.U. to try to limit the
number of people

12:33.152 --> 12:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming from Turkey crossing into
Europe, and
now they seem to be taking a
route directly

12:37.590 --> 12:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through Libya and across even
more treacherous
waters.

12:40.259 --> 12:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I'm glad you
raised that,
because we have no evidence that
that is the

12:45.531 --> 12:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case, either from our own people
on the ground
or from the U.N. figures.

12:49.702 --> 12:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the 150,000
people who have
arrived in Europe this year from
-- through

12:55.775 --> 13:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece, you will see that
they're made up
predominantly 46 percent of
Syrians, then

13:01.280 --> 13:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghans, then Iraqis. If you
look at the 46,000
who have arrived in Italy from
Africa, they

13:07.487 --> 13:11.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are Somalis, Gambians, Cote
d'Ivoire, Eritrea.

13:11.257 --> 13:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, although it's a good point
you make that
the clamp-down in Europe and in
Turkey might,

13:16.162 --> 13:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in time, bring people to seek an
alternative
to the Greek route, to come --
instead of

13:21.267 --> 13:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going from Turkey to Greece,
across the Aegean
Sea, they will try and make the
journey through

13:26.673 --> 13:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Egypt to Libya and then across
into North
Africa, from North Africa, into
Europe.

13:31.110 --> 13:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the moment, the people in
Turkey who are
fleeing the Syrian conflict
predominantly

13:35.348 --> 13:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not seeking to make that
route. They are
biding their time in Turkey.
There are reports

13:40.620 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of very large numbers in Izmir,
one of the
Turkish ports that is as an
entrepot, as a

13:47.093 --> 13:48.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
transit route for this.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the moment up, you have
got two distinct
waves, one from Syria and the
Middle East

13:52.465 --> 13:56.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Afghanistan into Greece, and
then the
other from Africa through North
Africa into

13:56.436 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Italy.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how are
the Europeans
dealing with this now new wave
of humanity

14:01.407 --> 14:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
washing up on their shores?

14:03.109 --> 14:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: I think that the
European
approach has three elements at
the moment.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As regard to the Middle East,
they're banking
a lot on the so-called deal with
Turkey, which

14:12.585 --> 14:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is showing a lot of strain.
Remember, for
your viewers' sake, there are a
million asylum-seekers

14:18.958 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Germany from last year who
are having asylum
and having their claims
processed in quite

14:24.230 --> 14:26.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an orderly way.

14:26.065 --> 14:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 55,000 people in
Greece who are
currently waiting for their
claims to be dealt

14:31.437 --> 14:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with. So, the deal with Turkey
is designed
to stem that flow. But when it
comes to the

14:35.675 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North African side of things,
the search-and-rescue
is much weaker. The legal routes
that might

14:41.180 --> 14:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eventually be available are much
less clear.

14:43.616 --> 14:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
And that's why you're seeing the
increasing
desperation for the
thousand-mile --
thousand-kilometer

14:48.621 --> 14:55.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crossing from North Africa from
Libya to Lampedusa,
which is the Italian island
where the boats

14:55.294 --> 14:57.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are aiming for.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at the moment, Europe is
really fighting
on all fronts, while trying to
deal, cope

15:00.533 --> 15:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on all fronts, and is also
coping with the
backlog from last year. And
that's why the

15:05.104 --> 15:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Commission have said
they are going
to come forward with new
proposals last week.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Organizations like mine, an
international
aid agency and refugee
resettlement agency

15:13.646 --> 15:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, say that you need first
clear legal
routes. Secondly, you have got
to tackle the

15:18.017 --> 15:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem at its source by having
proper humanitarian
aid in the countries in conflict
and in the

15:22.455 --> 15:26.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
neighboring states, and,
thirdly, Europe has
to deal with those who have
already arrived

15:26.325 --> 15:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe. And those that have a
genuine claim
to refugee status need to be
properly accommodated.

15:30.963 --> 15:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Miliband,
CEO of the International Rescue
Committee,

15:35.067 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thanks so much for joining us
tonight.

15:36.102 --> 15:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID MILIBAND: Thank you very
much, Hari.

15:44.877 --> 15:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's just over
two months
until the opening ceremony of
the Olympic

15:55.221 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Games in Rio de Janeiro.

15:57.056 --> 16:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the host country, Brazil,
it's been a
troubled journey. The Zika
virus, corruption

16:02.128 --> 16:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scandals, and an economic and
political meltdown
have all had an impact. But for
many residents,

16:07.633 --> 16:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most worrying development is
a spike in
crime across Rio and what
happens after the

16:13.172 --> 16:14.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
athletes go home.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" producer Jon Gerberg
teamed up
with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro,
and they report

16:19.111 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from the shantytowns, or
favelas, of Rio de
Janeiro.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Some of the
images are disturbing.

16:24.717 --> 16:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, National
Public Radio:
The image of glamorous Rio de
Janeiro most

16:29.889 --> 16:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people know: world-famous
beaches like Copacabana,
a draw for tourists and
residents alike.

16:35.628 --> 16:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just behind the high-rises
and hotels
lies another world. These are
two impoverished

16:42.768 --> 16:48.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities called Babilonia and
Chapeu Mangueira.
They are at the heart of a bold
policing experiment

16:48.875 --> 16:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that started in 2008. It's
called pacification.

16:52.778 --> 16:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It introduced community-based
police units
to many favelas that are close
to tourist

16:58.417 --> 17:04.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, its aim, to push out the
violent drug
gangs that operated here in
advance of Brazil's

17:04.357 --> 17:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debut on the world stage with
the 2014 World
Cup and, in two months' time,
the Olympics.

17:13.299 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Babilonia and Chapeu Mangueira
together became
the poster children of Rio's
transformation.

17:18.638 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crime dropped. New businesses
opened, catering
to tourists. Police would walk
around with

17:23.476 --> 17:28.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their weapons holstered.
Dignitaries like
U.N. Secretary-General Ban
Ki-Moon and media

17:28.347 --> 17:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like me were taken here to show
off the project's
success.

17:32.084 --> 17:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that success is now under
threat. Pacification
is in crisis. The first time I
came to this

17:39.792 --> 17:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
favela three years ago, it was
safe. It was
known as the Disneyland favela.
This time,

17:45.498 --> 17:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
residents refusing to talk to us
because they
have been threatened by drug
traffickers.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only way we can come is
with heavily
armed police.

17:52.438 --> 17:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These pacification units, known
as UPPs, now
walk around ready for battle.
Two rival gangs

17:58.110 --> 18:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are violently fighting for
control in this
area, and police are struggling.
At the crest

18:04.550 --> 18:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the favelas, Commander Paulo
Berbat tells
me the gangs use these jungle
paths to ferry

18:09.689 --> 18:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weapons and drugs in and out.

18:12.091 --> 18:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told me that, in March, the
battle for
control over these routes turned
deadly.

18:16.262 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's saying that, just up
here in this
area, members of a rival gang
from a different

18:23.803 --> 18:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community used the cover of the
forest to
try and invade this community
and take it

18:28.507 --> 18:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over. There was an intense
confrontation between
the drug gang that controls this
community,

18:32.712 --> 18:35.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and three of the drug
traffickers were killed.

18:35.314 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Businesses that had flourished,
attracting
foreigners, are now reporting a
50 percent

18:39.719 --> 18:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drop in revenue. Even though no
visitors have
been harmed in Babilonia and
Chapeu Mangueira,

18:45.257 --> 18:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tourists are choosing to stay
away. It's a
shocking turnaround for the
residents here.

18:53.866 --> 18:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among them is Rodrigo da Silva.
He sells food
to make a living on the beaches
just near

18:58.571 --> 19:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his home in Chapeu Mangueira. He
had hoped
that the Olympics and
pacification would provide

19:04.343 --> 19:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new opportunities, so he opened
a hostel,
advertised on Airbnb, but
clients today are

19:11.517 --> 19:13.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scarce

19:13.386 --> 19:17.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RODRIGO DA SILVA, Brazil
(through translator):
Our business has decreased. We
had much higher

19:17.623 --> 19:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expectations in terms of hosting
people throughout
the Olympics. If the situation
had improved,

19:22.695 --> 19:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe I wouldn't still have to
work here on
the beach.

19:25.931 --> 19:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Concerned
about gang
pressure, da Silva only agreed
to meet us

19:29.235 --> 19:31.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outside his favela.

19:31.037 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DA SILVA (through
translator): If
you talk too much, it ends
badly. Here's the

19:37.043 --> 19:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal: You do not mess with their
business.
I don't mess with their stuff
and they don't

19:41.313 --> 19:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mess with mine. Everyone wins,
in a way.

19:43.983 --> 19:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: But these
violent confrontations
have led to deep personal losses
across Rio.

19:49.789 --> 19:54.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In another part of the city,
Dayse Napoleao
told me about the last time she
spoke to her

19:54.226 --> 19:55.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
daughter, Sofia.

19:55.995 --> 19:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAYSE NAPOLEAO, Brazil (through
translator):
We spoke the week of her
birthday. She said

19:59.098 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was going to rent a house to
leave that
area. She was planning to get
back together

20:03.769 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with her ex-partner. She was
making so many
plans.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: A few days
later, Sofia
had been shot.

20:10.910 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAYSE NAPOLEAO (through
translator): I went
to see her at the hospital. The
doctor asked

20:15.981 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, are you prepared? I asked
him, why, sir?
The doctor said if her
hemorrhaging doesn't

20:22.021 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop, she won't survive. Later,
they told
me she hadn't been able to hold
on. She was

20:27.993 --> 20:29.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sofia and
her 1-year-old
daughter had been living in
another pacified

20:32.998 --> 20:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
favela, Vila Cruzeiro. To get
there, we needed
permission from the drug gangs
who control

20:37.803 --> 20:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the neighborhood. They didn't
want to be filmed.

20:41.173 --> 20:45.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our guide was Sofia's
sister-in-law, Carol,
who was with her the day she was
shot. She

20:45.978 --> 20:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says the police from the UPP,
who were fighting
with the drug traffickers,
sprayed their apartment

20:51.083 --> 20:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with bullets. Carol recorded the
scene with
her phone minutes after.

20:55.554 --> 21:01.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There was blood
everywhere, blood marks on the
wall, in the

21:01.227 --> 21:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
washing machine where she tried
to hold on,
blood marks in the pipes. The
police said

21:06.665 --> 21:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was a stray bullet, and that
she was on
the street.

21:10.503 --> 21:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a lie. She was indoors and
we have proof
of that. She was hit by two
bullets that opened

21:16.509 --> 21:18.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these holes in the door.

21:18.244 --> 21:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Innocent
bystanders are
being killed almost every day in
Rio. But

21:23.916 --> 21:28.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police too are dying in large
numbers, as
the battle over territory
continues.

21:28.888 --> 21:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our way to film with Carol
that morning,
we heard of another casualty. We
drove to

21:33.792 --> 21:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the funeral later that day.

21:43.736 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police officer Eduardo Dias had
been killed
the day before, shot by gang
members as he

21:48.307 --> 21:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was leaving his UPP post.
According to the
police, he was killed on this
street in front

21:53.646 --> 21:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Mangueira favela, and in
plain view
of the Maracana Stadium, site of
the Olympics

21:58.484 --> 22:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opening ceremony in August. A
police pastor
at the funeral addressed the
crowd.

22:03.889 --> 22:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Until when, dear lord, will we
have to bury
our good cops? Until when will
we bury our

22:10.996 --> 22:15.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, our parents with young
kids? Do
not forget the military police
in your prayers.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pray for us all," he said.

22:18.637 --> 22:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far this year, 41 police have
been killed
in Rio state. Murders generally
are up 15

22:25.678 --> 22:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent in the city, robberies
up 30 percent.
There is a sense here that
things are spiraling

22:31.350 --> 22:33.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of control.

22:33.219 --> 22:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just last week, a 16-year-old
girl was allegedly
gang-raped in a Rio favela by as
many as 30

22:39.158 --> 22:46.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men. Two boys, 14 and 16, were
tortured and
murdered by gang members in
another city over

22:46.098 --> 22:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bay. Both were documented on
social media
and spread widely around Brazil.

22:52.037 --> 22:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who study pacification say
it's too
early to conclude whether it has
failed. But

22:56.942 --> 22:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many mistakes have been made.

22:58.877 --> 23:04.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IGNACIO CANO, Rio State
University: For many
of us, the hope was that UPPs
would help transform

23:04.516 --> 23:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public security paradigm and
the police.
And, unfortunately, this is the
area in which

23:10.055 --> 23:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the advance has been more
modest, to say it
gently.

23:15.427 --> 23:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Ignacio
Cano is a professor
from Rio State University's
Laboratory on

23:20.099 --> 23:25.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Violence. He says police in Rio
are still
some of the most brutal in the
world, responsible

23:25.471 --> 23:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for 20 percent of the homicides
in the city,
according to Amnesty
International.

23:30.909 --> 23:35.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police officials have continued
to defend
pacification. They blame drastic
budget cuts

23:35.681 --> 23:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for many of the problems.
Colonel Ibis Pereira
is a former police commander in
Rio. He says

23:41.654 --> 23:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economic crisis in Brazil
has severely
crippled the policing program.
He also believes

23:47.026 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the spike in violence is partly
tied to the
imminent arrival of the
Olympics.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. IBIS PEREIRA, Former Police
Commander
(through translator): Drug
trafficking is

23:55.134 --> 23:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a business that follows the same
logic of
trade around the world, supply
and demand.

23:59.905 --> 24:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is an expectation of
profit, with
the presence of millions of
visitors to Rio,

24:05.477 --> 24:07.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and there is a moment of
weakness in the UPP
program.

24:07.946 --> 24:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Now many
are asking themselves
if there is a future for
pacification.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT MUGGAH, Igarape
Institute: There is
a sense in the police force and
within the

24:15.287 --> 24:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public at large in Rio generally
that pacification
has hit a wall.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Robert
Muggah studies
security and development at the
Igarape Institute

24:21.460 --> 24:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Rio. He says there will be
tens of thousands
of security forces protecting
tourists and

24:26.465 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infrastructure during these
Olympics, twice
the size of those used in the
last Summer

24:31.537 --> 24:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Games. But that was London, and
this is Brazil,
one of the most unequal
countries on Earth.

24:37.376 --> 24:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these Games, says Muggah,
will move resources
away from marginal communities.

24:42.181 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MUGGAH: Now, if you are a
white tourist
coming in from Europe or North
America, you're

24:46.385 --> 24:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be absolutely safe.
However, if you
are a low-income black resident
from a favela

24:52.491 --> 24:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the lead-up to the Olympics,
and just afterward,
you are actually going to be
experience probably

24:55.828 --> 24:57.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a heightened sense of
insecurity.

24:57.696 --> 25:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: Brazil has
promised the
Rio games will be safe. But
Olympic officials

25:02.034 --> 25:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acknowledge it's not enough to
just secure
the games.

25:05.003 --> 25:08.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIO ANDRADA, Communications
Director, Rio
2014: What we need to push, and
we will do

25:08.974 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, is to have more security
before the Games,
and more security after the
games. We don't

25:16.048 --> 25:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want the Games to be an island
of success
and perfection. We want the
Games to transform

25:22.054 --> 25:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rio, and to make Rio a safer
city in the years
to come.

25:26.425 --> 25:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: What part
pacification
will play in that is unclear.
And that worries

25:31.730 --> 25:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodrigo da Silva, who supports
the program.
If the police pull out of the
favelas after

25:36.902 --> 25:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Olympics, he predicts the
worst.

25:39.338 --> 25:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DA SILVA (through
translator): There
will be more violence, more
violence in all

25:43.509 --> 25:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the communities because of the
fights between
the drug gangs, fights against
the police.

25:48.180 --> 25:52.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the end, the ones who will
pay for this
will be the residents, as
always.

25:52.384 --> 25:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO: As Rio de
Janeiro gets
ready for the Summer Games, da
Silva says

25:57.623 --> 26:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Olympic dreams of a new life
shared by
many others are already out of
reach.

26:04.029 --> 26:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lulu
Garcia-Navarro
NPR News, Rio de Janeiro.

26:14.706 --> 26:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

26:18.977 --> 26:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
a city seen
as an economic success story
isn't satisfied

26:24.316 --> 26:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the president's record;
Vermont schools
facing consolidation or closure;
and confessions

26:30.722 --> 26:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of an Abu Ghraib interrogator.

26:34.059 --> 26:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Torrential rains and
flooding in
Southern and Central Texas have
made for a

26:40.165 --> 26:42.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
damaging and even deadly couple
of weeks.

26:42.634 --> 26:48.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A crest on the Brazos River is
eclipsing records
set more than two decades ago.
Large sections

26:48.173 --> 26:52.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Fort Bend County just
southwest of Houston
are underwater. Residents there
and in several

26:53.011 --> 26:58.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
other cities have been
evacuated. At least
six people have died since last
week. And

26:58.116 --> 27:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more rain is expected in the
coming days as
the weather pattern pushes east.

27:02.421 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get a report from one of the
worst-hit
areas.

27:05.157 --> 27:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Braun is the emergency
management coordinator
in Fort Bend County and joins me
via Skype.

27:10.195 --> 27:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff, I said these records were
set a couple
of decades ago. Tell me, have
you seen it

27:14.366 --> 27:16.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this bad before?

27:16.168 --> 27:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF BRAUN, Emergency Management
Coordinator,
Fort Bend County: No. No, Hari,
we have not

27:19.304 --> 27:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen it this bad. 1994 was the
record flood
here at the Richmond Gauge --
the city of

27:24.309 --> 27:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richmond is the center part of
the county,
and there's a gauge there that
everybody bases

27:28.580 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their flood finding on.

27:30.616 --> 27:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The record was 50.3 at that
gauge. We're going
to be somewhere about four feet
or a little

27:37.789 --> 27:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over four feet higher than the
water's ever
been seen in the county in the
last 25 years.

27:43.662 --> 27:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We see aerial
pictures sometimes
of horses being pulled off the
farm on to

27:49.334 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
porches of homes. We just see
huge swathes
of rural area that just look
like large lakes

27:54.473 --> 27:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now. How long until those drain?

27:56.708 --> 27:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF BRAUN: Yes, it's a major
concern for
us.

27:59.978 --> 28:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The water that enters into the
city of Simonton,
which is the first town in Fort
Bend County

28:06.485 --> 28:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hat has the Brazos River,
there's probably
over 300 homes that have water
in them there.

28:15.093 --> 28:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we also have the Texas
Animal Health
Commission going out to work
with some of

28:21.199 --> 28:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ranchers out there because
they have cattle
that are in compromised
positions.

28:28.340 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The water is flowing down the
river, not only
in rural areas, but into some of
our denser

28:34.479 --> 28:40.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
populated areas in the
Rosenberg-Richmond
area, and the water level is
going to crest

28:40.252 --> 28:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a very long, slow time frame.
So we may
be looking at several days,
maybe even a week,

28:47.459 --> 28:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the water staying at the
level that it's
at right now, which is several
feet above

28:51.964 --> 28:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what would be the record crest.

28:54.399 --> 29:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeff, these --
these -- that
river snakes all the way across
your county,

29:00.272 --> 29:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it has a lot of different
bends and probably
a lot of different elevations as
well.

29:04.343 --> 29:08.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there particular areas
you're more concerned
about in the coming days, in the
coming weeks

29:08.347 --> 29:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will be basically more
populated?

29:10.549 --> 29:16.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF BRAUN: Well, the city of
Simonton and
Rosenberg were the first two
cities hit. And

29:16.188 --> 29:22.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they both had mandatory
evacuations. The city
of Richmond has a mandatory and
voluntary

29:22.461 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evacuation.

29:24.229 --> 29:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have large parts of the
unincorporated
area of the county that have
been affected,

29:28.600 --> 29:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the river crests in Richmond
is then going
to move down into the southern
part of the

29:31.670 --> 29:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
county. A good part of the
southern part of
the county has levees. All our
leveed areas

29:40.779 --> 29:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are in fine shape. All the lid
operators are
doing a great job.

29:46.051 --> 29:51.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's no worry there. But
then once we
get past the lid areas, we're
looking at some

29:51.790 --> 29:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other areas where it is a
combination of rural
houses, and also more
bottomland, where there's

29:58.163 --> 29:59.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cattle and horses.

29:59.898 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of those individuals have
taken heed
of the warnings and have moved a
lot of the

30:05.337 --> 30:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people and livestock out of the
way.

30:07.139 --> 30:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Jeff Braun, the
emergency management coordinator
in Fort Bend

30:11.410 --> 30:14.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County, thanks so much for
joining us. I know
it's a busy day for you. Thank
you.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF BRAUN: Thank you.

30:16.448 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From where the
water is
to where it may be going.
Houston, which has

30:20.385 --> 30:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dealt with severe flooding
waters in recent
years, is bracing for
floodwaters to come

30:23.455 --> 30:25.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
its way.

30:25.323 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Walter is with the
Office of Emergency
Management for the city. He
joins me now.

30:28.627 --> 30:33.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, lot of times, the
floodwaters in Texas,
they basically go through
Houston to get to

30:33.498 --> 30:35.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Gulf of Mexico. How
concerned are you?

30:35.734 --> 30:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WALTER, Houston Office
of Emergency
Management: Well, obviously,
whenever we have

30:38.970 --> 30:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
significant rainfall events that
are back
to back the way that we have
seen the last

30:43.041 --> 30:46.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couple of months, we're very
concerned about
the impacts that we could have
here in the

30:46.978 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

30:48.847 --> 30:54.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had a history of
rivering flooding
in our area, and so we are, as
always, continuing

30:54.352 --> 30:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to monitor that. Unfortunately,
it's just
the way that Houston was built.
This was a

30:59.524 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small town that was eclipsed by
the town of
Galveston when it was built.

31:04.329 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, since then, we have just
had a lot
of development, we have had a
lot of building,

31:08.300 --> 31:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, unfortunately, the way that
the Southeast
Texas area drains is through a
system of bayous.

31:13.605 --> 31:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if we do receive heavy
amounts of rain
in concentrated areas, that can
put a lot

31:19.411 --> 31:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of strain on the bayous towards
the Gulf of
Mexico, which then results in
flooding.

31:23.849 --> 31:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done a lot of work
locally to help
mitigate against the flooding.
There is still

31:27.686 --> 31:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of work to do. And the
city and our
partners at Harris County, Fort
Bend County,

31:32.324 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Montgomery County, all the
different jurisdictions
around us, we are really
committed to helping

31:37.729 --> 31:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to solve some of these flooding
problems,
and also just letting people
know what to

31:42.000 --> 31:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect and what steps they need
to take to
prepare ahead of these types of
situations.

31:46.638 --> 31:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Flooding is
one of those
things that you can somewhat
prepare for when

31:50.509 --> 31:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know that the rain is heavy,
it's falling,
and you can see the flooding is
happening

31:54.179 --> 31:56.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
upstream.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you trying to prepare parts
of Houston
for possibly evacuations like
there are happening

31:59.417 --> 32:01.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Fort Bend County?

32:01.353 --> 32:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WALTER: So, our major
concern in the
city of Houston is not so much
the river flooding

32:05.824 --> 32:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you see on the Brazos in
Fort Bend County
and in the other parts to the
west of the

32:11.863 --> 32:13.565 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

32:13.598 --> 32:18.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our major concern is flash
flooding. That
usually is what impacts us here.
So, that's

32:18.403 --> 32:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really our concern. We're
looking at rainfall
totals. We're looking at the
location of where

32:22.374 --> 32:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that rain is going to fall. The
last three
federally declared disasters we
had, which

32:27.012 --> 32:32.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were all within one calendar
year of each
other, were all mostly related
to flash flooding

32:32.984 --> 32:37.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and water quickly rising and
water quickly
receding in our neighborhoods.

32:37.289 --> 32:42.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's a little bit more
what we're concerned
about. We are monitoring the
Addicks and Barker

32:42.794 --> 32:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reservoirs, which are on the
west side of
Houston, which were built in the
late '30s

32:46.932 --> 32:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
following a catastrophic flood
in downtown
Houston. Those are holding up.
They are holding

32:51.770 --> 32:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the water. It is blocking some
roads in that
area, but those are doing the
job that they're

32:56.508 --> 32:58.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers has been
working very closely to control
the amount

33:00.679 --> 33:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of water coming out of those
reservoirs as
it flows into a bayou that comes
right through

33:05.083 --> 33:06.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
downtown Houston.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Michael Walter
with the Office of Emergency
Management for

33:09.254 --> 33:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the city of Houston, thanks for
joining us.

33:14.192 --> 33:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WALTER: Thank you.

33:19.431 --> 33:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tomorrow,
President Obama
will return to the first city he
visited after

33:26.137 --> 33:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becoming president, Elkhart,
Indiana. It was
one of the worst-hit cities back
in 2009,

33:31.643 --> 33:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the president will be
delivering a speech
to tout what's been accomplished
since then.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will sit down with our Gwen
Ifill for an
interview while he's there, and
then answer

33:39.651 --> 33:43.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions from residents in a
town hall special
we will be airing tomorrow
night.

33:43.855 --> 33:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It all comes during a tough
phase of the election
cycle, as the president seeks to
make a case

33:49.160 --> 33:50.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for his legacy.

33:50.528 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

33:55.033 --> 34:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Obama's
trip to Elkhart,
Indiana, tomorrow marks his
fifth visit since

34:00.105 --> 34:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was a candidate in 2008.

34:02.040 --> 34:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2009, he went there to
announce $170 million
in federal stimulus money for
Elkhart County.

34:10.448 --> 34:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elkhart is a city of about
50,000 people that
is known as the R.V. capital of
the world,

34:16.354 --> 34:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an industry on the rebound since
cratering
during the recession.

34:20.392 --> 34:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At its worst, unemployment
reached 20 percent.
Now it's 3.8 percent. Some give
the president

34:27.432 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a certain amount of credit for
that.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY YOUNG, Elkhart, Indiana:
He's been doing
as best as he could do. It
wasn't perfect

34:32.737 --> 34:34.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
when he got in.

34:34.606 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM LAMBRIGHT, Elkhart, Indiana:
We have come
a long way. I think that the
economy is fairly

34:38.877 --> 34:42.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good now. When it crashed in
'08, it was like
a ghost town around here.

34:42.814 --> 34:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ed Neufeldt knows
that firsthand.
Laid off from his job in the
R.V. industry

34:48.286 --> 34:54.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2009, he now works four
part-time jobs,
including cleaning a doctor's
office. He's

34:54.225 --> 34:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thankful there's enough work for
him.

34:56.161 --> 35:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED NEUFELDT, Elkhart, Indiana:
If you want
a job in Elkhart County, there's
a job. You

35:01.166 --> 35:05.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can find a job. There's help
wanted signs
all over. Elkhart's doing great.

35:05.403 --> 35:10.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's quite a contract
to when we
last met him in 2009, when his
employer of

32 years closed.

35:12.777 --> 35:19.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED NEUFELDT: We were one of the
bigger corporations.
I thought we would be one of the
last to be

35:19.784 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around, but we weren't.

35:21.753 --> 35:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Despite the recovery,
Neufeldt
says there's a big divide
globally. Republicans

35:26.992 --> 35:28.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Democrats can't get along.

35:28.994 --> 35:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED NEUFELDT: They're angry.
That's the reason
so many people are voting for
Donald Trump.

35:33.865 --> 35:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to see a change. I
guess they feel
like government is just -- is
crooked.

35:39.471 --> 35:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, with President Obama
going to Elkhart
tomorrow to make his case for an
economic

35:44.275 --> 35:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legacy, Neufeldt presents one of
the challenges
for the president and for the
Democratic candidates

35:49.781 --> 35:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who want to succeed it. Neufeldt
doesn't know
who he will vote for in the
fall.

35:54.753 --> 35:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when the "NewsHour" caught
up with locals
at the Memorial Day Parade, some
said they

35:59.290 --> 36:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were unhappy with the president,
like this
Trump supporter who listed his
complaints

36:04.229 --> 36:06.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Mr. Obama.

36:06.097 --> 36:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH STORY, Elkhart, Indiana:
Lack of pride
of America and everybody getting
their feelings

36:09.401 --> 36:12.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hurt over stupid things.

36:12.570 --> 36:18.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In 2012, President
Obama lost Elkhart
County to Mitt Romney by a 2-1
wide margin

36:18.343 --> 36:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his way to losing the state.
Although Elkhart's
fortunes and those of the R.V.
industry have

36:24.049 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a dramatic turnaround, the
lingering
anxiety mirrors communities
across the country

36:30.221 --> 36:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worried about their future.

36:32.390 --> 36:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

36:39.030 --> 36:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Vermont is in
the midst
of the largest reorganization of
public schools

36:51.176 --> 36:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has seen in the last 125
years. As many
other rural states have already
done, Vermont

36:56.548 --> 37:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to consolidate its many
small school
districts. But it's not
happening without

37:00.885 --> 37:02.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a fight.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week has this report as part of
our weekly

37:05.623 --> 37:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education series, Making the
Grade.

37:10.462 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Vermont is a
collection of small
towns, many with just one or two
schools,

37:25.043 --> 37:28.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and where people feel they have
a say in their
children's education.

37:28.313 --> 37:30.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE HULL-PARENT, School
Board Member:
People have a very loud voice.
You know, some

37:30.815 --> 37:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people will say Montpelier
controls everything,
there's really not a lot of
voice left. Well,

37:35.787 --> 37:37.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there is.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Like Suzanne
Hull-Parent, Vermonters
stay close with their schools
through their

37:40.825 --> 37:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
locally elected school boards.
There's one
for almost every town.

37:45.597 --> 37:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE HULL-PARENT: I have been
on the school
board for 12 years. I think when
you have

37:49.601 --> 37:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local people living in the
community, making
the decisions about their school
the best

37:53.505 --> 37:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can, it's going to be more
vested in
the good of that community.

37:58.076 --> 38:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Something else
about Vermont
schools, they're among the
smallest in the

38:02.614 --> 38:04.282 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE HULL-PARENT: You get
more individual
attention. I was blessed to have
that and

38:06.618 --> 38:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm blessed to have my children
have that.
And my daughter feels like she
has a voice.

38:11.222 --> 38:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not sure, in a bigger
place, that
she would feel she had a voice.

38:15.860 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Small schools and
local control
are in the DNA here. But that's
changing as

38:21.466 --> 38:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a result of a new state law
called Act 46.
It aims to consolidate Vermont's
school districts

38:28.306 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and reduce their numbers by
half.

38:30.875 --> 38:37.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, communities can vote
yes to unification
and get tax breaks or say no and
lose a portion

38:37.115 --> 38:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their school funding, and
risk being assigned
into a merger by the state.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: And I don't see how this
is helpful
for our children.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: But what if the vote is
no? What happens?

38:47.825 --> 38:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS, Superintendent,
Franklin Northeast
Supervisory Union: Change is
hard. I think

38:51.729 --> 38:53.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
change is hard.

38:53.464 --> 38:58.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: For school
superintendent Jay
Nichols, change could help many
students.

38:58.369 --> 39:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nichols oversees five small
school districts
in Northern Vermont. Two of them
are neighboring

39:04.776 --> 39:08.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
districts, Richford and
Enosburg, and both
have high schools.

39:08.813 --> 39:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: Enosburg High
School, by Vermont
standards, a good-sized high
school, comprehensive

39:15.353 --> 39:21.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
school, offers a lot of
programming, you know,
seven or eight A.P. classes, has
a Junior

39:21.392 --> 39:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROTC program, which has saved
kids. Parents
will tell you, that has saved
their kids and

39:28.666 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had them not drop out of school,
because of
Junior ROTC. Richford kids can't
go do that.

39:33.137 --> 39:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Richford High
School, in the
town next door, offers only two
A.P. classes,

39:38.309 --> 39:42.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not to mention no ROTC. The
reason for this
is size.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: It's a smaller
school, and it's
all about economies of scale.
And they offer

39:45.984 --> 39:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as much as they can for the size
that they
are.

39:48.152 --> 39:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Richford has about
150 students.
Enosburg has roughly double.

39:52.957 --> 39:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: If we become one
district, a
kid could take some classes in
Enosburg, some

39:56.361 --> 40:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
classes in Richford. If we share
the staff,
and share all the kids, we can
offer more.

40:04.168 --> 40:06.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's all.

40:06.137 --> 40:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But Act 46 was
designed to accomplish
another goal, tax relief.
Two-thirds of the

40:11.643 --> 40:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money Vermont spends on public
schools comes
from property taxes.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAP SMITH, Vermont State
Speaker of the House:
It's a statewide property tax.
And when people

40:18.583 --> 40:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get their bill, it tends to be a
big one.

40:21.853 --> 40:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: House Speaker Shap
Smith pushed
Act 46 through the state
legislature.

40:26.090 --> 40:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAP SMITH: One of the things
that was driving
change was the fact that we have
declining

40:31.729 --> 40:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enrollment, and yet we have
increasing expenses.
Our student-to-teacher ratio is
one of the

40:38.770 --> 40:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lowest in the country, and that
is driving
the education costs for the last
15 to 20

40:45.843 --> 40:47.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: We have too many
adults for the
number of kids we have. That's
why we have

40:49.247 --> 40:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most expensive education
system in the
United States.

40:52.350 --> 40:57.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Act 46 could lower
costs by
sharing staff and resources, but
the fear

40:57.522 --> 40:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, some districts will go
farther.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUZANNE HULL-PARENT: You will
see school closures.

41:01.559 --> 41:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: To Vermonters like
Suzanne Hull-Parent,
that would be significant.

41:05.963 --> 41:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE HULL-PARENT: You're
losing the heart
of many communities. That's
where they meet.

41:11.636 --> 41:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where they have functions
that aren't
even school-related. That's
where families

41:15.106 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in need get support services. I
think it just
is going to be devastating to
communities.

41:21.346 --> 41:24.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they're going to change
the landscape
of Vermont with that.

41:24.849 --> 41:31.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Closing small
schools means
having to send students
elsewhere, to larger

41:31.089 --> 41:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools that offer more courses,
but may not
be better.

41:34.425 --> 41:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Like, people who go to
small schools,
like they -- when they graduate,
they leave

41:38.496 --> 41:41.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with something unique and
special that other
people don't have.

41:41.566 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I came from a huge
school with a
lot of resources, and I came in
knowing that

41:46.637 --> 41:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there wasn't as many advanced
programs. But
connection is really important.
You know,

41:52.744 --> 41:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's a lot of support here.

41:55.513 --> 42:02.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Act 46 does
prohibit school
closings for at least four
years, but there

42:02.353 --> 42:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are other things Vermonters
would have to
give up right away.

42:05.189 --> 42:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: School choice in
Vermont. If
you live in a town that is a
tuition town,

42:11.763 --> 42:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can go to school any place
you want, paid
for by the taxpayers.

42:15.199 --> 42:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Tuition towns are
those without
schools, often middle schools
and high schools.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Merging could cost them school
choice.

42:22.306 --> 42:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Today, we have the ability
to send our
kids to the best fit for them,
and we're going

42:27.578 --> 42:29.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to give that up.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Many of these
parents in Montgomery,
Vermont, send their children to
public and

42:32.717 --> 42:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
private high schools, including
this private
school in Canada, using school
choice vouchers

42:38.322 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worth some $14,000 each. In all,
it's about
a million dollars that's
projected to leave

42:44.529 --> 42:46.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the district.

42:46.364 --> 42:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: This is a huge
portion of the
budget that we can keep in our
local schools

42:49.967 --> 42:51.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and communities.

42:51.035 --> 42:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Could you offer
more A.P. courses?

42:52.303 --> 42:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY NICHOLS: We certainly could.

42:53.838 --> 42:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: You don't think
there's a chance
that that million dollars...

42:55.840 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE HULL-PARENT: Is just
going to infuse
in and get -- no, I don't think
that's going

42:59.444 --> 43:01.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to happen. No, no.

43:01.712 --> 43:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: All these debates
will soon
be put to the voters. On June 7,
residents

43:07.518 --> 43:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here will decide whether to move
forward on
plans to merge.

43:12.023 --> 43:17.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Franklin County, Vermont, I'm
John Tulenko
of Education Week reporting for
the "PBS NewsHour."

43:17.395 --> 43:31.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The military's
use of forced
interrogation has always been a
contentious

43:31.676 --> 43:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subject, even though many who
may have once
approved of its use now have
second thoughts.

43:36.814 --> 43:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our newest addition to the
"NewsHour" bookshelf
is Eric Fair's "Consequence: A
Memoir."

43:41.519 --> 43:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff recently talked
with him about
his firsthand experience with
torture.

43:45.389 --> 43:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eric Fair,
welcome to the "NewsHour."

43:47.892 --> 43:49.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC FAIR, Author, "Consequence:
A Memoir":
Thanks for having me.

43:49.694 --> 43:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is a
very painful
book to read. What did you want
to accomplish

43:54.265 --> 43:55.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by writing it?

43:55.399 --> 43:57.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC FAIR: I know that it's a
painful book
to read.

43:57.702 --> 44:01.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an incredibly a painful
and chaotic
book to write. And I think what
I wanted to

44:01.239 --> 44:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accomplish was, I have been
writing about
my experiences in Iraq for close
to 10 years

44:05.676 --> 44:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. And I have been writing
mostly op-eds
and small essays.

44:08.379 --> 44:13.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it was important for
me to get
the entire story down. It was
submitted originally

44:13.050 --> 44:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just about Iraq. And at that
point, editors
and agents suggested that I
needed to spend

44:17.889 --> 44:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more time exploring the whole
story.

44:19.690 --> 44:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Remind our
audience why you
ended up in Iraq in the first
place. You were

44:24.595 --> 44:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working for a contractor, a
company that was
hired to be involved in
interrogating prisoners

44:30.301 --> 44:30.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC FAIR: Right. Sure.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had been in the Army from 1990
to 2000.
I was an Arabic linguist. And I
had received

44:35.006 --> 44:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my discharge in 2000, when it
appeared that
there was no reason for an
Arabic linguist

44:38.776 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be in the Army. Nothing
seemed to be going
on in the world.

44:41.045 --> 44:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went back home to Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania,
became a police officer, and was
subsequently

44:45.583 --> 44:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diagnosed with a heart condition
that ended
my career. And this was after
9/11. The war

44:50.354 --> 44:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iraq was just beginning to
ramp up. The
invasion was over. Contracting
companies were

44:54.458 --> 44:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desperate for employees in a
number of different
positions. And they were
desperate to get

44:58.229 --> 45:00.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people over as quickly as
possible.

45:00.064 --> 45:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I knew it was the one way
that I could
essentially sneak in without any
kind of health

45:03.634 --> 45:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
examination and get back into
that community.
I had supported the invasion and
I felt like

45:08.439 --> 45:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had an obligation, because of
that support,
to be a part of it.

45:11.275 --> 45:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you
think you were
going to be doing when you went
to Iraq, and

45:14.979 --> 45:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then how did that compare with
what you found
yourself in the middle of?

45:17.915 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC FAIR: My experience with a
war in the
Middle East had been, like many
Americans,

45:22.520 --> 45:24.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the first Gulf War.

45:24.255 --> 45:28.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the impression that I had
was that
we -- there would be thousands
of Iraqi troops

45:28.192 --> 45:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrendering, being brought back
to the rear,
and then essentially debriefed.
And so we

45:32.863 --> 45:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have talked to them about
the units
that they were in and the
strength of those

45:35.666 --> 45:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
units, things like the kind of
weapons they
had or the systems -- that
weapons systems,

45:40.004 --> 45:43.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to gauge just how committed and
how strong
these troops were.

45:43.441 --> 45:47.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had not anticipated doing
interrogations
or being part of a prisoner of
war camp in

45:47.712 --> 45:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq and surrounded by combat.
And so we were
driven out to Abu Ghraib and
essentially started

45:53.384 --> 45:57.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work the next day. And much of
it was really
more associated with law
enforcement.

45:57.288 --> 46:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the idea of deciding
whether or not
someone was guilty or why they
had been captured,

46:01.792 --> 46:08.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or if they should stay in
custody. The insurgency
was just beginning to ramp up at
point. Mortars

46:08.466 --> 46:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were definitely coming into Abu
Ghraib, but
soldiers were being killed by
IEDs. The death

46:12.703 --> 46:14.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
count was continuing to rise.

46:14.505 --> 46:19.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea that the insurgency or
the war was
going to end was clear to us
that it wasn't.

46:19.443 --> 46:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there was an absolute
need for more
intelligence information to
figure out what

46:23.648 --> 46:25.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was going wrong.

46:25.516 --> 46:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You write in a
lot of detail,
graphic detail, about what you
saw, how people

46:30.721 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were treated. Was it a matter of
not expecting
this? What do you think,
ultimately, drove

46:38.462 --> 46:40.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you to want to get out of there?

46:40.231 --> 46:43.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC FAIR: I think I was aware
right away
that, morally, this was
difficult, the kind

46:43.801 --> 46:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of treatment that prisoners were
receiving.

46:46.270 --> 46:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in terms of the legal
issues surrounding
it, it was policy. And this is
essentially

46:51.909 --> 46:56.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we were supposed to be
doing. The vast
majority of us, as contractors,
were prior

46:56.047 --> 46:59.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soldiers. And so we felt a
commitment to the
people in uniform and to
ourselves and to

46:59.950 --> 47:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our community to do these
things.

47:01.752 --> 47:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I lasted about two months doing
interrogations.
And then eventually I took
another position

47:05.589 --> 47:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in Baghdad that wasn't
involved in interrogations.
But I knew then, even though
that I had supported

47:10.728 --> 47:14.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the war, that the invasion was
wrong. There
clearly were no chemical weapons
in Iraq.

47:14.965 --> 47:18.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And much of the narrative that
we heard about
what was going on there simply
wasn't true.

47:18.436 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much of the
book, Eric Fair,
is about how this affected you
and continues

47:23.274 --> 47:25.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to affect you.

47:25.109 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC FAIR: The process started
in late 2006,
in which I knew I needed to
start writing

47:27.978 --> 47:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about some of the things that I
had done.

47:29.947 --> 47:34.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I knew that the only way to
do that effectively
was to write about my own role.
And so it

47:34.385 --> 47:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't to be a policy pundit and
talk about
the administration or about the
legal issues

47:39.056 --> 47:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrounding it, but I needed to
provide an
honest account of my own
narrative.

47:43.327 --> 47:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, at the time when I started
writing, I
wasn't calling this torture.
That's something

47:46.764 --> 47:51.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I only processed recently and
begun to realize
that, absolutely, the things we
did is torture.

47:51.302 --> 47:53.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so there have been
consequences for me.

47:53.204 --> 47:56.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I recognize that the people
who were on
the other side of the table in
the interrogation

47:56.173 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
booths are the ones who suffered
the true
consequences.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you want
to come out
of this book?

48:00.578 --> 48:06.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC FAIR: Well, I think, like
any writer,
it's some sort of hope for a
change of the

48:06.417 --> 48:08.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
narrative.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a presidential -- we
have presidential
candidates who are now talking
about water-boarding

48:11.021 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and talking about other
aggressive techniques.
We have the director of the CIA
suggesting

48:14.892 --> 48:20.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that his men or his employees
wouldn't water-board,
which is encouraging, but also
very disturbing

48:20.397 --> 48:26.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in terms of -- it's a
recognition of where
we can go, and we can still go
back to where

48:26.070 --> 48:27.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we were.

48:27.838 --> 48:30.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, we may even go back to
something
-- something far worse. So,
there needs to

48:30.508 --> 48:35.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be an honest narrative about not
only what
this does to certainly the
personnel that

48:35.913 --> 48:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will put in these positions,
but to the
-- the kind of things that it
does to the

48:39.383 --> 48:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people that are in our prisoner
of war camps.

48:41.118 --> 48:47.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you come away
of a clear
idea of what is within the
bounds of what

48:47.158 --> 48:54.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should be permitted when
interrogating someone
who has done something terrible
against the

48:54.832 --> 49:00.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, whether it's ISIS
or al-Qaida
or something, and what steps
over the line?

49:00.037 --> 49:02.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you come away knowing what
that line is?

49:02.173 --> 49:03.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ERIC FAIR: No.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's an excellent
question,
because I think once you begin
to push the

49:06.377 --> 49:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limits of interrogation, which,
in and of
itself, is already kind of a
potentially abusive

49:10.514 --> 49:15.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of thing, forcing someone
to talk to
you, the minute you begin to
push those limits,

49:15.386 --> 49:19.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the minute you entitle
yourself to force
someone to cooperate with you,
to essentially

49:19.490 --> 49:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change their will, you have
moved into this
world of torture.

49:22.960 --> 49:27.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Torture, for me, were things
like stress positions,
and in particular sleep
deprivation. And I

49:27.598 --> 49:32.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that a good number of
Americans would
scoff and even laugh and suggest
that we can

49:32.269 --> 49:37.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go as far as water-boarding. And
I think you
can see just how lost we are in
this idea

49:37.641 --> 49:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are different levels
of abuse and
different levels of
interrogation.

49:41.912 --> 49:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's anything that violates
another human
being's will is torture. And, as
Americans,

49:46.884 --> 49:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's the attitude we
need to have.
We don't care what about
organizations like

49:50.721 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS or intelligence agencies in
a place like
Syria are doing.

49:54.291 --> 49:57.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We care about what we're doing.
We care about
the image that we project. We
have an obligation

49:57.695 --> 50:02.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to things like the Constitution
and the Bill
of Rights. And those things
require us to

50:02.533 --> 50:03.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behave in a certain way.

50:03.901 --> 50:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eric Fair, the
book is "Consequence:
A Memoir."
