00:47.933 --> 00:52.467
NEW YORK, HARI SREENIVASAN

00:52.467 --> 00:53.500
>> GOOD EVENING.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.900
WE LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF THE

00:56.900 --> 00:57.867
SHUTDOWN ON CONGRESS

01:09.933 --> 01:11.900
SPEAKER BOEHNER SAYS IMMIGRATION

01:11.900 --> 01:13.033
REFORM IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT

01:13.033 --> 01:14.167
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:14.167 --> 01:17.467
SAID HE WAS, QUOTE, HOPEFUL.

01:17.467 --> 01:18.867
THIS WEEKEND THE GOVERNOR FROM

01:18.867 --> 01:20.433
CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRS

01:20.433 --> 01:21.567
REPUBLICAN THAT SAID HE WOUL

01:21.567 --> 01:22.700
SPONSOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

01:22.700 --> 01:24.433
GIVE MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTE

01:24.433 --> 01:27.000
IMMIGRANTS A PATHWAY T

01:27.000 --> 01:27.133
CITIZENSHIP.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.400
FOR MORE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM

01:28.400 --> 01:31.267
THIS YEAR, WE'RE JOINED BY

01:31.267 --> 01:33.800
WASHINGTON FROM ALAN GOMEZ

01:33.800 --> 01:34.667
ALAN, FIRST QUESTION

01:34.667 --> 01:35.767
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THI

01:35.767 --> 01:37.200
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:37.200 --> 01:39.667
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN YESTERDAY

01:39.667 --> 01:41.333
THAT HE'LL CO SPONSO

01:41.333 --> 01:43.233
LEGISLATION WITH DEMOCRATS

01:43.233 --> 01:44.633
TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION?

01:44.633 --> 01:46.167
>> IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT IN THE

01:46.167 --> 01:47.867
HOUSE, IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:47.867 --> 01:49.033
THEY'RE HOPING HE'S FIRST OF

01:49.033 --> 01:50.300
SEVERAL THAT WILL BE COMING ON

01:50.300 --> 01:50.567
BOARD.

01:50.567 --> 01:53.300
THEY HAVE A MOST WANTED LIST O

01:53.300 --> 01:54.300
ABOUT A DOZEN HOUSE REPUBLICAN

01:54.300 --> 01:55.433
THAT ARE INTERESTED IN SOME SORT

01:55.433 --> 01:56.867
OF BILL THAT INCLUDES A PATHWA

01:56.867 --> 01:58.267
TO CITIZENSHIP

01:58.267 --> 01:59.267
BUT THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO

01:59.267 --> 02:00.733
REMAIN IN THE MINORITY IN TH

02:00.733 --> 02:01.033
HOUSE.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.767
THERE'S STILL THAT LARGE

02:02.767 --> 02:05.600
CONSERVATIVE BASE OF THE HOUSE

02:05.600 --> 02:08.000
THAT IS JUST UNEASY ABOUT AN

02:08.000 --> 02:10.400
KIND OF BILL THAT PASSES

02:10.400 --> 02:11.567
CITIZENSHIP FOR UNDOCUMENTED

02:11.567 --> 02:11.833
IMMIGRANTS

02:11.833 --> 02:13.400
IT'S A BIG STEP FOR THEM

02:13.400 --> 02:15.267
THEY'RE SEEING THIS AS A WAY T

02:15.267 --> 02:17.100
PUSH FOR AN IMMIGRATION PACKAG

02:17.100 --> 02:18.667
THAT INCLUDES THAT PATHWAY

02:18.667 --> 02:19.533
THEY'RE HOPING TO GET TH

02:19.533 --> 02:20.733
SPEAKER TO DO SOMETHING ALON

02:20.733 --> 02:22.000
THE LINES OF WHAT WE JUST SA

02:22.000 --> 02:24.400
WITH THE SHUTDOWN, WHERE YOU SAW

02:24.400 --> 02:27.133
DEMOCRATS AND A SMALL GROUP OF

02:27.133 --> 02:28.000
REPUBLICANS VOTING TO PASS

02:28.000 --> 02:29.100
SOMETHING, BUT LIKE I SAID

02:29.100 --> 02:31.100
THERE IS STILL A BIG CHUNK O

02:31.100 --> 02:32.700
THAT HOUSE THAT'S RESISTANT TO

02:32.700 --> 02:32.967
THIS

02:32.967 --> 02:34.533
IT'S A SMALL STEP BUT DEFINITELY

02:34.533 --> 02:35.800
THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR TH

02:35.800 --> 02:36.633
HOUSE DEMOCRATS.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.967
>> SO THEY ONLY NEED THREE DOZEN

02:38.967 --> 02:40.667
VOTES FOR REPUBLICANS TO SWITC

02:40.667 --> 02:40.933
SIDES?

02:40.933 --> 02:42.367
ARE THERE OTHER PIECES O

02:42.367 --> 02:43.633
LEGISLATION THAT ARE WINDING

02:43.633 --> 02:45.200
THEIR WAY THROUGH ABOU

02:45.200 --> 02:45.333
IMMIGRATION?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.733
>> YES, THERE IS QUITE A FEW

02:46.733 --> 02:49.100
AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES THINGS IN

02:49.100 --> 02:50.767
THE HOUSE SO COMPLICATED, AS

02:50.767 --> 02:50.900
ALWAYS

02:50.900 --> 02:52.300
YOU HAVE THIS BILL, IT'S A

02:52.300 --> 02:53.300
DEMOCRATIC BILL.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.867
IT'S GOT ABOUT 180 DEMOCRATI

02:55.867 --> 02:57.000
CO-SPONSORS AND NOW THE ON

02:57.000 --> 02:57.733
REPUBLICAN ONE

02:57.733 --> 02:59.267
THEN YOU KIND OF MOVE INTO THE

02:59.267 --> 03:00.500
MIDDLE OF THE SPECTRUM A LITTL

03:00.500 --> 03:02.933
BIT WHERE YOU GOT SOMEBODY LIK

03:02.933 --> 03:04.467
REPRESENTATIVE DARRELL ISSA, ALS

03:04.467 --> 03:05.900
FROM CALIFORNIA, WHO SHOULD BE

03:05.900 --> 03:06.867
INTRODUCING THIS WEEK A BILL

03:06.867 --> 03:08.133
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE

03:08.133 --> 03:09.600
NATION'S UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS

03:09.600 --> 03:11.300
WHO APPLY FOR LEGAL STATUS FOR A

03:11.300 --> 03:12.133
PERIOD OF SIX YEARS.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.400
THAT WOULD BE SORT OF AN

03:14.400 --> 03:15.567
INTERMEDIARY WAY OF APPROACHIN

03:15.567 --> 03:17.267
IT, AND THAT'S SOMETHING I KNO

03:17.267 --> 03:18.667
A LOT OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAV

03:18.667 --> 03:19.767
BEEN INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THE

03:19.767 --> 03:21.600
DON'T WANT TO SEE ALL 12 MILLION

03:21.600 --> 03:22.733
AS ONE BIG BLOCK

03:22.733 --> 03:24.867
THEY KIND OF WANT TO SPLIT IT UP

03:24.867 --> 03:26.067
IN LITTLE GROUPS AND TREAT THE

03:26.067 --> 03:26.633
DIFFERENTLY.

03:26.633 --> 03:28.833
THEN ON THE OTHER END OF THE

03:28.833 --> 03:29.767
SPECTRUM, YOU HAVE THE HOUSE

03:29.767 --> 03:31.533
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.267
THEY'VE BEEN PUSHING THIS PIEC

03:33.267 --> 03:34.133
BY PIECE APPROACH.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.267
THEY'VE BEEN ADVANCING SMALLER

03:35.267 --> 03:36.533
BILLS THAT DEAL WITH SMALL

03:36.533 --> 03:38.100
SECTIONS OF THE IMMIGRATIO

03:38.100 --> 03:39.667
ISSUE, SO BORDER SECURITY, MOR

03:39.667 --> 03:41.533
VISAS FOR HIGH-TECH WORKERS,

03:41.533 --> 03:44.067
MORE VISAS FOR LOW-SKILLED

03:44.067 --> 03:45.333
WORKERS, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO

03:45.333 --> 03:46.500
PROCEED WITH THAT SO THAT THEY

03:46.500 --> 03:48.267
CAN KIND OF ADDRESS SEPARATE

03:48.267 --> 03:51.033
PARTS OF THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE

03:51.033 --> 03:52.567
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO IT ALL AT

03:52.567 --> 03:53.967
ONCE

03:53.967 --> 03:56.333
>> SO IS THIS KEY IDEA O

03:56.333 --> 03:57.967
PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP LIKELY TO

03:57.967 --> 04:01.500
CAUSE A SIMILAR RIFT WITHIN TH

04:01.500 --> 04:02.900
REPUBLICAN PARTY BETWEEN

04:02.900 --> 04:04.900
MODERATES AND MORE CONSERVATIV

04:04.900 --> 04:05.067
REPUBLICANS?

04:05.067 --> 04:06.167
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.767
I MEAN, WE LOOK AT THE

04:08.767 --> 04:10.000
IMMIGRATION DEBATE AS IT'S

04:10.000 --> 04:11.167
CHANGED OVER THE LAST YEAR

04:11.167 --> 04:13.400
THE MAGIC NUMBER REMAINS FOR

04:13.400 --> 04:15.733
REPUBLICANS THE 27% OF HISPANI

04:15.733 --> 04:16.967
VOTERS THAT MITT ROMNEY GOT

04:16.967 --> 04:18.100
YEAR AGO IN THE ELECTION

04:18.100 --> 04:19.933
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GOP FROM

04:19.933 --> 04:23.200
A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, SENATO

04:23.200 --> 04:26.033
McCAIN, OTHER SENATORS IN TH

04:26.033 --> 04:27.767
REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO WER

04:27.767 --> 04:28.867
THINKING ON THE BROADER SCALE,

04:28.867 --> 04:30.300
ON THE NATIONAL SCALE, FOR THE

04:30.300 --> 04:31.433
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE

04:31.433 --> 04:33.000
SOMETHING THAT INCLUDES

04:33.000 --> 04:34.700
PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP SO THEY

04:34.700 --> 04:36.267
CAN START HAVING A BETTE

04:36.267 --> 04:37.267
CONVERSATION WITH HISPANIC

04:37.267 --> 04:38.833
VOTERS WHO CONTINUE TO INCREASE,

04:38.833 --> 04:41.200
WHO CONTINUE TO BE A BIGGE

04:41.200 --> 04:43.800
PORTION OF THE ELECTORATE.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WHEN YOU

04:44.800 --> 04:46.067
LOOK AT THESE HOUSE MEMBERS, A

04:46.067 --> 04:48.767
LOT OF THEM, JUST FROM 2010 TO

04:48.767 --> 04:52.200
2012, AFTER REDISTRICTING, HOUSE

04:52.200 --> 04:53.767
REPUBLICANS REPRESENT 6.

04:53.767 --> 04:55.600
MILLION FEWER MINORITIES

04:55.600 --> 04:57.033
NOW THEIR DISTRICTS ARE, O

04:57.033 --> 04:59.300
AVERAGE, UP TO 75% WHITE

04:59.300 --> 05:00.667
SO THERE ARE JUST DOZENS AND

05:00.667 --> 05:02.233
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HOUSE

05:02.233 --> 05:03.500
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE JUST

05:03.500 --> 05:04.800
TINY, TINY FRACTION OF

05:04.800 --> 05:05.833
MINORITIES IN THEIR DISTRICT, SO

05:05.833 --> 05:08.767
FOR THEM, THIS IDEA OF THE

05:08.767 --> 05:11.033
GRANDER PARTY TRYING TO APPEAL

05:11.033 --> 05:12.867
TO HISPANICS IS NOT AS IMPORTANT

05:12.867 --> 05:13.867
FOR THEM

05:13.867 --> 05:15.433
IT DOESN'T REALLY RESONATE BAC

05:15.433 --> 05:16.867
IN THEIR HOME DISTRICT, SO FOR

05:16.867 --> 05:18.600
THEM IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT

05:18.600 --> 05:19.933
SO I WOULD SAY THERE IS A GOOD

05:19.933 --> 05:22.933
GOOD CHUNK OF THAT HOUSE THAT IS

05:22.933 --> 05:23.333
JUST RESISTANT TO ANYTHING THA

05:23.333 --> 05:25.200
INCLUDES A PATHWAY T

05:25.200 --> 05:27.033
CITIZENSHIP AS MANY OF THE

05:27.033 --> 05:29.033
REFER TO IT AS AMNESTY, SO THERE

05:29.033 --> 05:31.700
IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE THAT

05:31.700 --> 05:32.433
FRICTION

05:32.433 --> 05:33.700
HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER IS BAC

05:33.700 --> 05:36.567
WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE THESE DAY

05:36.567 --> 05:37.700
TRYING TO CORRAL DIFFERENT SIDES

05:37.700 --> 05:38.567
OF HIS CAUCUS.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.133
>> WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD

05:40.133 --> 05:41.533
THEY HAVE SUCH A SMALL WINDO

05:41.533 --> 05:41.667
LEFT

05:41.667 --> 05:42.400
>> THEY DO

05:42.400 --> 05:44.667
THERE'S ONLY, I THINK, ABOUT 1

05:44.667 --> 05:46.667
LEGISLATIVE DAYS LEFT IN THI

05:46.667 --> 05:47.967
CALENDAR YEAR.

05:47.967 --> 05:48.900
OBVIOUSLY, THAT CAN STRETCH INTO

05:48.900 --> 05:49.933
NEXT YEAR A LITTLE BIT

05:49.933 --> 05:52.067
THE LIKELIHOOD, IF I KNEW THAT

05:52.067 --> 05:53.200
I WOULD BE WRITING THAT STOR

05:53.200 --> 05:54.767
RIGHT NOW AT MY DESK

05:54.767 --> 05:56.633
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THI

05:56.633 --> 05:57.900
THROUGH, BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME

05:57.900 --> 06:00.200
TIME, AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF

06:00.200 --> 06:02.233
BILLS TEED UP READY TO GO, READY

06:02.233 --> 06:03.233
TO BE INTRODUCED ON THE HOUS

06:03.233 --> 06:04.367
FLOOR AND TO BE VOTED ON

06:04.367 --> 06:05.933
IF IT HAPPENS, IT COULD HAPPEN

06:05.933 --> 06:07.200
VERY QUICKLY

06:07.200 --> 06:08.767
WE SHOULD KNOW A LOT MORE IN THE

06:08.767 --> 06:09.633
NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

06:09.633 --> 06:11.900
>> ALAN GOMEZ FROM USA TODAY

06:11.900 --> 06:13.033
THANKS SO MUCH

06:13.033 --> 06:13.733

THERE WAS A SHORTAGE FOR WEEKS

AFTER THE STORM.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.333
NEW YORK IS CREATING ITS OWN

20:20.767 --> 20:22.900
UNIVERSE, AND IT MAKES I

OUR INVESTIGATION IS THAT AN

20:36.433 --> 20:39.567
AWFUL LOT OF THESE GROUPS AREN'T

A LOT OF THEM DON'T EVEN GIVE.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.733
MANY SO IT RAISE AZ LOT OF

20:56.733 --> 21:02.667

GOING ON OUT THERE, HOW BAD IS

21:06.233 --> 21:06.667
