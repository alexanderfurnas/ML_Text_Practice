GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:09.309 --> 00:14.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: upheaval on campus. The
University of Missouri
chancellor

00:14.448 --> 00:21.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and president step down amid
increasing student and faculty
protests over racism and
representation.

00:21.455 --> 00:27.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Monday: Russia is caught in a
state-sponsored doping scandal,

00:27.127 --> 00:32.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting Russian athletes in
danger of being banned from the
2016 Olympics.

00:32.165 --> 00:36.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And life on the road
with Gloria Steinem. The famed
activists talks about fighting

00:36.904 --> 00:40.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for feminism in a new memoir.

00:40.374 --> 00:44.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM, Author, "My Life
on the Road": It was only after
I had been living this
on-the-road

00:44.111 --> 00:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life for quite a long time,
until I was 50, that I realized,
wait a minute, this isn't

00:50.717 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just something on the way to
something else. This is it.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:56.056 --> 01:02.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.062 --> 01:14.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Students and
faculty members celebrated today
at the main campus of the

01:14.141 --> 01:18.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University of Missouri, after
the head of the university
system quit.

01:18.946 --> 01:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Tim Wolfe was accused
of ignoring racial incidents.
The situation reached a

01:23.483 --> 01:29.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
boiling point when black
football players announced a
boycott Saturday night. Later,

01:29.423 --> 01:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the chancellor overseeing the
main campus also resigned. We
will investigate this story

01:33.627 --> 01:36.530 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in detail after
the news summary.

01:36.530 --> 01:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A judge in Louisiana
set bail at $1 million apiece
today for two police

01:41.668 --> 01:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers accused of murdering an
autistic boy. Six-year-old
Jeremy Mardis was killed

01:47.507 --> 01:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his father was wounded when
the officers fired on the
family's vehicle 18 times. A

01:52.746 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawyer for the father says
police video shows he had his
hands up when the shooting
started.

01:59.753 --> 02:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Jordan, two
Americans, a South African and
two Jordanians were gunned

02:05.258 --> 02:11.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down today by a police captain
in Amman. It happened at a
regional police training center.

02:11.198 --> 02:16.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to the dead, seven
people were wounded, including
two more Americans. The

02:16.570 --> 02:20.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gunman was shot and killed by
soldiers. U.S. officials said
the Americans were security

02:20.741 --> 02:24.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
contractors training
Palestinian police.

02:24.678 --> 02:28.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Washington, President Obama
promised an investigation.

02:28.148 --> 02:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We take this very
seriously and we will be

02:32.686 --> 02:39.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
working closely with the
Jordanians to determine exactly
what happened. But, at this
stage,

02:39.626 --> 02:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to just let everyone to
know that this is something we
are paying close attention

02:45.098 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, and at the point where the
families have been notified,
obviously, our deepest
condolences

02:52.339 --> 02:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be going out to them.

02:54.674 --> 02:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The president spoke
during an Oval Office meeting
with Israeli Prime Minister

02:59.379 --> 03:03.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Benjamin Netanyahu. The
relationship has been strained
since the Iran nuclear deal that

03:03.817 --> 03:06.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Israel opposed.

03:06.253 --> 03:10.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Netanyahu insisted he's
still committed to Middle East
peace.

03:10.924 --> 03:16.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister: We have not
given up our hope for peace. We

03:16.463 --> 03:20.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will never give up our hope for
peace. I don't think that anyone
should doubt Israel's
determination

03:20.801 --> 03:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to defend itself against terror
and destruction, but neither
should anyone doubt Israel's
willingness

03:25.872 --> 03:31.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make peace with any of its
neighbors that genuinely want to
achieve peace with it.

03:31.678 --> 03:35.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still, the White
House said it no longer expects
peace can be achieved before

03:35.482 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Obama leaves office
in January 2017.

03:39.686 --> 03:45.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Israel also
joined those saying a bomb
destroyed that Russian airliner
over

03:45.425 --> 03:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Sinai Peninsula. The Israeli
defense minister said -- quote
-- "There is a high probability

03:49.429 --> 03:52.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was a bombing."

03:52.199 --> 03:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, evacuation flights
resumed for Russian tourists
stranded in Sinai. About

03:58.805 --> 04:04.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
23,000 have flown home since
Saturday. Cargo planes are
transporting their luggage
separately.

04:04.478 --> 04:10.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Greenhouse gas
levels hit an all-time high last
year. The U.N. Weather Agency's

04:10.317 --> 04:16.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report today comes amid -- comes
ahead of a world summit on
climate change. The report

04:16.256 --> 04:23.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says carbon dioxide levels are
now more than 140 percent higher
than before the Industrial

04:23.563 --> 04:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Revolution. The amount of
methane is up 250 percent since
that same period. And the report

04:28.435 --> 04:32.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forecasts another
increase next year.

04:32.005 --> 04:37.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, a federal bankruptcy
judge OKed a reorganization plan

04:37.577 --> 04:43.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Milwaukee. It
stems from damage claims over
sexual abuse

04:43.550 --> 04:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by priests. The plan calls for
paying a total of $21 million to
nearly 460 victims.

04:51.191 --> 04:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street had a
blue Monday over worries about
the global economy. The

04:56.429 --> 05:03.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly 180 points to close
at 17730. The Nasdaq fell

05:03.537 --> 05:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nearly 52 points. And the
S&amp;P 500 was down 20.

05:08.008 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And SeaWorld says
that it will phase out its
killer whale shows in San Diego

05:14.648 --> 05:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by 2017. Instead, the theme park
will focus on the animals'
natural setting and behavior.

05:21.488 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The announcement follows growing
criticism of the treatment of
killer whales in captivity.

05:26.526 --> 05:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SeaWorld has seen attendance
plummet as a result. The
company's decision doesn't apply

05:31.064 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to its other theme parks that
include killer whale shows.

05:35.969 --> 05:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the University of Missouri
president ousted over his
handling

05:41.274 --> 05:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of racial issues; Russia's
involvement in widespread
steroid use; addressing Mexico's

05:46.813 --> 05:53.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diabetes epidemic,
and much more.

05:53.653 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It's been an
eventful day in Columbia,
Missouri, where the university
has been the

06:06.933 --> 06:11.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
center of national attention
over racial tensions on campus.

06:11.605 --> 06:15.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the heart of the protest was
a hunger strike that resonated
across the campus and across

06:15.242 --> 06:17.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the state.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM WOLFE, President, University
of Missouri: I am resigning as
president of the University

06:19.679 --> 06:22.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Missouri system.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The announcement
from Tim Wolfe came right after
the university system's
governing

06:25.485 --> 06:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
body opened a special meeting.

06:28.755 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM WOLFE: This is not, I
repeat, not the way change
should come about. Change comes

06:40.400 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from listening, learning, caring
and conversation. Unfortunately,
this has not happened, and

06:50.577 --> 06:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is why I stand before you
today. And I take full
responsibility for this
frustration,

06:56.316 --> 07:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I take full responsibility
for the inaction that has
occurred.

07:02.822 --> 07:08.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wolfe's resignation
followed months of complaints
over racial slurs on the
overwhelmingly

07:08.128 --> 07:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white campus at Columbia,
including a swastika drawn on a
dormitory wall with human feces.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The student government president
was one of the targets.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAYTON HEAD, President, Missouri
Students Association: What
happens here is that they

07:20.774 --> 07:24.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the opportunity to create
an environment that is
inclusive, that you can put in
place

07:24.678 --> 07:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a zero tolerance policy for acts
of bias and discrimination on
this campus.

07:30.583 --> 07:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As protests grew,
Wolfe's car was blocked during a
homecoming parade, black

07:36.189 --> 07:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graduate student Jonathan Butler
began a hunger strike,
protesting the slurs and the
overall

07:41.161 --> 07:44.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
racial climate at the
state university.

07:44.197 --> 07:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tipping point arrived this
weekend, when at least 30 black
football players announced

07:49.235 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they would boycott team
activities until Wolfe was
removed.

07:54.107 --> 07:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Head coach Gary Pinkel endorsed
the protest, posting a photo of
the team locking arms,

07:59.012 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, "We are united." By
today, faculty members were
pledging to join in.

08:04.784 --> 08:12.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The season of academic
discontent is not limited to
Missouri. At Yale, students and
administrators

08:12.592 --> 08:18.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have also been thrust into
campus upheaval, as a memo over
appropriate Halloween costumes

08:18.064 --> 08:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
triggered longstanding tensions
about race and free speech.

08:24.003 --> 08:29.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Columbia, Tim Wolfe's
resignation exposed raw nerves
about the lack of diversity
among

08:29.075 --> 08:34.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students and faculty, while also
showcasing the muscle of the
school's athletic department.

08:34.781 --> 08:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As students celebrated, Jonathan
Butler declared his hunger
strike over.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN BUTLER, Student,
University of Missouri: It
should not have taken this much.
And it

08:41.721 --> 08:45.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is disgusting and vile that we
find ourselves in the place that
we do.

08:45.692 --> 08:51.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also, the football
players announced they are
returning to practice tomorrow.

08:51.164 --> 08:56.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this evening, before the
chancellor also resigned, I
spoke to Brenda Smith-Lezama,

08:56.803 --> 09:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the vice president of the
student body at the university
of Missouri, and Scott Brooks,

09:00.573 --> 09:04.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an associate professor
of sociology.

09:04.110 --> 09:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brenda Smith-Lezama, you have
been in the middle of this and
you know what the conversations

09:09.315 --> 09:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been. How much relief is
there tonight or how much
concern is there still in the

09:14.654 --> 09:17.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wake of this protest?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRENDA SMITH-LEZAMA, Vice
President, Missouri Students
Association: Well, the relief is

09:19.125 --> 09:20.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unsurmountable.

09:20.827 --> 09:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, it's just
a first step. And that's the one
thing that I think all

09:25.498 --> 09:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students involved in this
movement want to reiterate. This
is not the endgame. So, we

09:30.603 --> 09:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to think about how we're
going to move forward and
proceed with the administration,

09:34.140 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as well as involving students.

09:36.810 --> 09:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Professor Brooks, is
this a new issue that we're
hearing so much about now

09:41.314 --> 09:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or is it an old one that's
been given new life?

09:45.151 --> 09:47.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT BROOKS, Associate
Professor, University of
Missouri: No, it's definitely an
old one

09:47.854 --> 09:50.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that has been given new life.

09:50.957 --> 09:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can go back to 1969 with the
Legion of Black Collegians and
them giving a list of

09:57.630 --> 10:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
demands of their concerns at
that time. And so whether we're
talking about 1969 here at

10:04.003 --> 10:08.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the University of Missouri or
whether we're talking about
other campuses, I think that

10:08.908 --> 10:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a fairly common story for
black students, even black
faculty staff, that they are
operating

10:15.615 --> 10:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on -- at a university and they
have this kind of mixed feeling.

10:21.087 --> 10:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, it's a place where
they're coming to get the best
that they can from the
university.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are looking and hoping and
expecting that this is the time
of their lives, and

10:30.597 --> 10:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet they are stuck -- struck
with a harsh reality, that
they're not treated often as

10:36.169 --> 10:40.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
equal citizens, as equal
students, and that's across the
levels, faculty, staff and
students.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So this is not a new story.

10:43.843 --> 10:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Brenda Smith-Lezama,
tell me how a little bit what --
how this blew up, how

10:49.582 --> 10:53.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this became such a big issue,
and whether this has been your
personal experience, the

10:53.920 --> 10:57.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories that we're now hearing
coming out of campus about the
experiences of black students

10:57.891 --> 11:00.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not only now, but
for some time now.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRENDA SMITH-LEZAMA:
Well, of course.

11:03.129 --> 11:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think that, for most
students, there has been a shift
post-Ferguson and going back

11:07.834 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that year, year-and-a-half
period, the activism on campus
has been at an all-time

11:13.072 --> 11:18.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high. I think that, for the
first time, movements were being
led in a very systematic and
very

11:18.478 --> 11:22.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intentional manner.

11:22.148 --> 11:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, coming from the student
body, I think that there is a
lot of change that we all

11:27.921 --> 11:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see that needs to be made, and
this is the first time that we
have all been able to rally

11:30.189 --> 11:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around one cause, and that
is making them do better.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, this is a
post-Ferguson effect, as it
were?

11:36.462 --> 11:39.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRENDA SMITH-LEZAMA:
Absolutely. Absolutely.

11:39.699 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, at least for me, I
will say that, prior to Ferguson
and all the events

11:44.437 --> 11:50.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that followed, there was
obviously racial issues and
there was a lot of issues of
systematic

11:50.743 --> 11:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oppression with itself. However,
after Ferguson was -- one, we
were met with a lot of silence

11:56.816 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from our administration. And I
think what is most frustrating,
is that when students

12:00.153 --> 12:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were crying out for help, our
administration left us stranded.

12:03.923 --> 12:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you
this. And then I want to ask
Professor Brooks as well.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What difference will it make
that president Wolfe is gone, if
this is a question and a

12:12.632 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem that's predated even
his arrival on campus in 2012?

12:18.104 --> 12:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRENDA SMITH-LEZAMA: Removing
Tim Wolfe is by no means going
to solve the system that

12:23.810 --> 12:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has built for so many years here
at the University of Missouri.

12:27.447 --> 12:33.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, I think that
specifically after Ferguson, Tim
Wolfe did serve as kind of the
icon of

12:33.987 --> 12:38.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the system that has failed us.
And one of the biggest things
that students have brought

12:38.658 --> 12:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up with concern is the fact that
we need to have educators in
those positions, people

12:43.930 --> 12:47.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are willing to make that
change, people who are willing
to listen to students, rather

12:47.634 --> 12:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than meet us with silence and
not validate our concerns and
our struggles.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Professor Brooks,
what about that? What difference
will it make if the president

12:56.843 --> 12:59.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the university is now gone?

12:59.846 --> 13:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT BROOKS: Well, I think that
Brenda has articulated it very
well.

13:06.119 --> 13:13.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is simply a step in the
right direction. The difference
is not about removing Tim Wolfe.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The difference is going to be
seen in what happens next. And
that's really what we're

13:16.829 --> 13:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
encouraged to pay attention to.

13:20.967 --> 13:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, what we're excited
about is, how can we move
forward, now that we know that

13:26.105 --> 13:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is at least one less
person that we feel has been an
obstacle? This is the way

13:31.010 --> 13:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that students feel. And this is
also a way that faculty, staff
are coming together. We're

13:37.350 --> 13:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coming together under the guise
of, you know, what are -- what
changes can we make now that

13:43.723 --> 13:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have at least an opportunity
for shared government?

13:48.361 --> 13:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, I want to
go to what happens next, but
allow me for -- going back

13:51.330 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a moment, would this have
reached the head it did,
starting with you, Professor

13:56.469 --> 14:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brooks, if there had not been
the involvement of the student
athletes, of the football team?

14:00.807 --> 14:02.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Was that the tipping point?

14:02.508 --> 14:05.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT BROOKS: Right.

14:05.344 --> 14:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I think that you have to
look at the student athlete and
their student side. So,

14:13.219 --> 14:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if the student athlete could not
connect with this larger student
movement, the student

14:17.990 --> 14:21.928 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
athlete wouldn't
necessarily come forward.

14:21.928 --> 14:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I agree that there is no doubt
the importance of sport is --
you know, we know how important

14:28.234 --> 14:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sport has become, particularly
at the university. We call
athletics the front porch of the
university,

14:34.373 --> 14:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about the collegiate arms
race, the sports industrial
complex. There was $1 million
that

14:40.480 --> 14:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the university could occur in
terms of fines if the student
athlete didn't perform, if

14:45.318 --> 14:48.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the football players did
not go out onto the field.

14:48.621 --> 14:54.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is no doubt that
that is an important
consideration for each and every
university

14:54.494 --> 14:59.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has a big football -- a
big-time football team. So,
that's not simply a Missouri
issue.

14:59.265 --> 15:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a national issue. And
student athletes have had this
power and they have been trying

15:05.505 --> 15:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to exercise this in different
ways for the last couple of
years, as we have seen student

15:10.810 --> 15:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletes organizing around
amateurship vs. being able to
gain some stipends.

15:16.916 --> 15:24.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is a growing national
piece as well. The revolt of the
athlete has never gone too

15:24.190 --> 15:29.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far beneath the surface. It did
take a moment like this and the
courage of our concerned

15:29.629 --> 15:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students to step forward to help
to galvanize and give student
athletes even a voice and

15:34.901 --> 15:38.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a platform and strength
to move forward.

15:38.070 --> 15:42.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And, Brenda
Smith-Lezama, so you have had
today's victory. You admit --
you

15:42.108 --> 15:46.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concede that it's a partial
victory. So what does happen
next?

15:46.345 --> 15:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRENDA SMITH-LEZAMA: Well,
honestly, I'm a student. I am
not an administrator. I am not

15:51.284 --> 15:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the one who is paid and tasked
with coming up with these
answers.

15:55.354 --> 15:59.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the one thing that
has been so frustrating over the
past year-and-a-half,

15:59.292 --> 16:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that administrators have
often held back and asked us to
come up with the solutions.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't go to school full-time,
work and then on top of that do
an administrator's job as

16:08.968 --> 16:12.071 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
well. And that's
what's so crucial.

16:12.071 --> 16:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will say is that this, if
nothing else, really put our
administrators on high alert

16:17.109 --> 16:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to know that University of
Missouri students will not stand
idly by and let our university

16:20.780 --> 16:23.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fall to pieces.

16:23.182 --> 16:26.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Brenda Smith-Lezama,
vice president of the student
body at University of Missouri,

16:26.919 --> 16:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Professor Scott Brooks,
thank you both very much.

16:29.655 --> 16:34.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT BROOKS: Thank you.

16:34.594 --> 16:43.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRENDA SMITH-LEZAMA:
Thank you for having us.

16:43.469 --> 16:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now allegations
that Russian athletes have been
gaming international sports

16:48.674 --> 16:51.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for years.

16:51.377 --> 16:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A report out today from an
independent commission of the
World Anti-Doping Agency found
-- quote

16:57.183 --> 17:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "a deeply rooted culture of
cheating in Russia's track and
field programs, including

17:02.722 --> 17:07.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systemic doping, bribery and
destruction of evidence, much of
it done at the Russian
government's

17:07.126 --> 17:10.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
behest."

17:10.162 --> 17:15.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The commission's report
recommended lifetime bans for
five Russian runners, including
the

17:15.134 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gold and bronze medal winners
at the 2012 London Olympics.

17:20.773 --> 17:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Commission head Richard Pound
said the doping had to be
state-sponsored.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD POUND, Chairman, World
Anti-Doping Agency: Our
conclusion was that all of this

17:27.713 --> 17:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could not have happened or
continued to happen without the
knowledge of and either actual

17:34.320 --> 17:39.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or implied consent of the state
authorities. They were not
operating the sport, but, as

17:39.425 --> 17:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I say, they would certainly have
known, and could not not have
known about this.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's take a
deeper look into the
investigation and its impact
with a sports

17:48.968 --> 17:52.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reporter who has long
covered the Olympics.

17:52.738 --> 17:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christine Brennan of USA Today
is also a commentator for ABC
News, and she joins me now.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Welcome back to the
program, Christine.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is an extraordinary
report, isn't it?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA
Today: Well, it is.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's groundbreaking and it's
earth-shattering in many ways,
although, for those who have

18:06.819 --> 18:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been watching what's happened
with FIFA, the soccer governing
body, and all the concerns

18:11.257 --> 18:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there -- and people may go back
and remember the East Germans
and the cheating in swimming

18:15.361 --> 18:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and track and field all the way
back to the '60s and into '70s,
that in some ways this

18:19.198 --> 18:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
may not shock people at all.

18:22.635 --> 18:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here we are talking about
one of the great forces in
Olympic sports, Russia, of
course,

18:29.008 --> 18:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just hosted the last Olympic
Games, the Winter Olympics,
which Vladimir Putin paid $51
billion

18:33.879 --> 18:34.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to put on.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

18:36.582 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: And now to
have this story hit, in many
ways no surprise, and yet
obviously

18:40.686 --> 18:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eye-opening and very alarming.

18:43.456 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when you
start to read this report,
Christine, you see, it's not

18:47.059 --> 18:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only the athletes, it's the
coaches, it's the doctors, it's
the people who regulate

18:50.896 --> 18:53.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sport, and, as we said,
going all the way up to the
government.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Exactly.
The government is implicated.

18:54.834 --> 18:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, I don't know that
we will ever get to the bottom
of exactly how high up this

18:59.538 --> 19:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goes in Russia, but I think we
can dream big. And when you
think of how important the Sochi

19:05.845 --> 19:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olympics were to Putin and to
Russia and the kind of money
that they spent in that country

19:11.250 --> 19:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this time with so many
issues, you just have to wonder
if it goes all the way to the

19:14.653 --> 19:16.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

19:16.889 --> 19:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I said, we will never
know. And, journalistically, we
have no idea right now. But what
the World

19:21.861 --> 19:28.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anti-Doping Agency is alleging
here is extraordinary. And if it
starts to work people up and
sponsors

19:28.234 --> 19:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up to what's really going on in
some of these countries, then I
think it turns out to be

19:30.970 --> 19:33.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a good thing.

19:33.139 --> 19:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it possible to
put on a finger on how many --
who won and who didn't

19:37.943 --> 19:41.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win, who medaled and who didn't
as a result of this cheating?

19:41.881 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh, in some
ways. You alluded to the fact
that the gold and the bronze
medal

19:44.417 --> 19:47.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the women's 800 meters
would be taken away.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think fans over the years have
come to realize, for example,
with Lance Armstrong, when they

19:51.490 --> 19:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stripped away his titles, seven
Tour de France titles, that
there was only one person in

19:56.262 --> 20:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the three times seven, 21 of the
top three in each seven years,
who would have been clean.

20:02.368 --> 20:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so going back to the Olympic
record books in the '70s, where
we know the East Germans

20:06.238 --> 20:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the Soviets were cheating,
and then you still look at their
records and you still

20:09.975 --> 20:13.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
look at their names as
medalists, so, in some way,
that's almost a futile effort
because

20:13.612 --> 20:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's so much bigger than that.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it certainly is sad for
those athletes who haven't
cheated to be denied those
medals.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we should
point out the Russian
government, Russian officials
are

20:24.090 --> 20:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that this is politically
motivated. They are denying it.

20:27.860 --> 20:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among other things, they're
saying that how can you accuse
them of doing this when the

20:34.800 --> 20:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international agency was in
charge of doing the testing?
They're saying, if we were doing

20:38.971 --> 20:41.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this, then why didn't
somebody see it at the time?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, and
it's a good point, except for
this, that the Russian officials

20:43.809 --> 20:46.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
run those labs.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the lab was in Sochi. And, of
course, this does bring into
question what was going on

20:50.382 --> 20:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Sochi Olympics. Right
now, we're talking track and
field athletes. And, obviously,

20:54.487 --> 20:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is a huge sport for the
Summer Games, and whether these
athletes and whether Russia

20:57.590 --> 21:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should even be allowed to have
track and field athletes in Rio
next summer.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

21:01.727 --> 21:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: But you go
back to Sochi, which of course
was this hub of international

21:05.397 --> 21:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sports based on the Winter
Olympics, and those officials
there are running that lab.

21:11.570 --> 21:16.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also keep in mind that Russian
security officials were
involved, and there are the
implications

21:16.175 --> 21:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and allegations that they were
actually strong-arming some of
these people to make these
decisions

21:19.678 --> 21:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or to in some cases destroy
up to 1,400 drug tests.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine, just
quickly, another argument that
is heard today is that, well,

21:28.888 --> 21:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is going on in a lot of
places, it's not just the
Russians. How much validity is

21:31.023 --> 21:32.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there?

21:32.591 --> 21:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh, I think
it's true. And I think, when we
look at baseball, look

21:34.593 --> 21:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at all of our sports in the
United States, to think that the
bad chemists, Judy, are

21:37.796 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still way ahead of
the good chemists.

21:40.566 --> 21:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, drug testing is important,
but they can't catch all the
designer drugs that are being

21:44.637 --> 21:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made that they haven't yet found
a test for. So I think the
important thing for fans and

21:50.376 --> 21:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who love sports, buyer,
beware. As a consumer, you know
that that product could

21:54.880 --> 21:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be tainted, whether it's Major
League Baseball, the NFL, any
sport in the United States
potentially,

21:58.651 --> 22:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but also at the Olympic level.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
just quickly, effect on the
Olympics going forward?

22:03.989 --> 22:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Yes. I think
it has a big effect, because
when you look at the tainted

22:07.593 --> 22:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nature of this and the fact that
if people can't trust what
they're watching, if you

22:11.630 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't trust a foot race between
eight men or eight women, what
in the world can you

22:15.801 --> 22:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trust and how does that impact
sponsors moving forward?

22:18.771 --> 22:23.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christine
Brennan, it's quite a story.

22:23.542 --> 22:28.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN:
Thank you, Judy.

22:28.314 --> 22:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

22:32.384 --> 22:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Take care.

22:36.288 --> 22:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

22:40.492 --> 22:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
overwhelming victory for
Myanmar's opposition party;
Politics

22:45.965 --> 22:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday, scrutiny and late-night
humor; and how Gloria Steinem's
life on the road shaped

22:50.836 --> 22:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her into a feminist icon.

22:53.372 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, combating a growing
diabetes epidemic in Mexico.

23:00.479 --> 23:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports. It's part of
his series Agents for Change.

23:05.718 --> 23:10.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The North
American Free Trade Agreement
brought Mexico chain
restaurants,

23:10.756 --> 23:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
malls and big box stores with
abundant shelves, and an
epidemic of diabetes.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAVIER LOZANO, Clinicas del
Azucar: Regular food, but sugar
free.

23:19.832 --> 23:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Javier
Lozano, whose mother suffers
from the disease, thinks he can
make

23:24.003 --> 23:28.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a difference. Three years ago,
he opened a chain called
Clinicas del Azucar, or the
Sugar

23:28.374 --> 23:30.509 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinics.

23:30.509 --> 23:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAVIER LOZANO: Our dream was,
imagine there's a clinic in
every corner. Just as we have

23:34.713 --> 23:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
franchise for hamburgers and
pizza and fried chicken.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The clinics
are a one-stop shop to see a
doctor or nutritionist, get

23:43.656 --> 23:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your eyes checked, or feet, then
pick up a pair of shoes or
snacks.

23:48.594 --> 23:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lozano, a 33-year-old MIT
graduate, hopes to have 200
outlets by 2020, but it's a tiny

23:55.534 --> 24:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraction of the demand in a
country that by then could have
20 million diabetics.

24:01.173 --> 24:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIMON BARQUERA, National
Health Institute: Basically,
diabetes prevalence has been
doubling

24:05.577 --> 24:08.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
every six to 10 years.

24:08.514 --> 24:13.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Dr. Simon
Barquera of Mexico's National
Health Institute says it

24:13.719 --> 24:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now affects 14 percent of
Mexican adults, a population
with widespread genetic
predisposition

24:18.290 --> 24:21.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to diabetes.

24:21.627 --> 24:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Adding to the risk, 72 percent
are obese or overweight. Those
numbers are now higher than

24:26.999 --> 24:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mexico's northern neighbors, but
with double the impact. Far
fewer Mexicans have their

24:31.337 --> 24:34.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
symptoms under control.

24:34.073 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SIMON BARQUERA: For example,
in Canada and the U.S., more
than half of the population

24:38.243 --> 24:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with diabetes has adequate
control, in Mexico, only 25
percent.

24:41.747 --> 24:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Complicating
matters, half of those affected
aren't aware they have

24:47.052 --> 24:51.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diabetes. And those who are
diagnosed can remain
asymptomatic for years, and they
do

24:51.056 --> 24:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
little to control its advance.

24:54.126 --> 24:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SIMON BARQUERA: They go
looking for private care and
they see that it's too
expensive.

24:58.931 --> 25:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, usually, they go back to
the public care, and it's
limited. So, you know, when

25:06.472 --> 25:11.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people have a difficult
decision, we usually just defer
the decision.

25:11.877 --> 25:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Maria De La
Luz Mireles (ph) says she
struggled for years with
scattered,

25:18.117 --> 25:22.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
substandard care until
specialists at the Sugar Clinic
helped bring her symptoms under

25:22.287 --> 25:24.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

25:24.356 --> 25:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA DE LA LUZ MIRELES, Mexico
(through translator): I went to
many clinics and never got to
see

25:28.727 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a specialist. It was general
doctors and they'd change my
medications. This went on for 20

25:32.965 --> 25:35.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

25:35.033 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That overall
lack of access to care means
more advanced cases: limb
amputations,

25:40.939 --> 25:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heart, kidney and eye disease,
more people like Luis Martinez,
at 64, long retired and

25:46.512 --> 25:48.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly incapacitated.

25:48.814 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS MARTINEZ, Diabetes Patient
(through translator): My kidneys
have been very seriously
affected,

25:54.186 --> 25:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so I have to have dialysis twice
a day, and four months ago, I
lost the last bit of sight

25:58.724 --> 26:00.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I had.

26:00.959 --> 26:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As a young
man, Martinez moved from the
country to the city, part of

26:05.731 --> 26:11.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a massive urbanization. Three
out of four people now inhabit
cities in this once agrarian

26:11.270 --> 26:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation, says Sugar Clinics
endocrinologist Eduardo Camacho.

26:16.008 --> 26:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. EDUARDO CAMACHO, Clinicas
del Azucar (through translator):
Most people lived in the
countryside,

26:20.179 --> 26:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so they used a lot of energy
and got a lot of exercise in
order to feed themselves.

26:25.317 --> 26:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was labor-intensive work.
Now, with urbanization, people
are using much less energy in
their

26:29.588 --> 26:32.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
daily lives to get the
food that that they need.

26:32.991 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Then there's
the food, plentiful, affordable,
but processed. Dr.

26:40.065 --> 26:44.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Barquera says it's an
industrialized version of the
healthy, traditional Mexican
diet.

26:44.837 --> 26:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDUARDO CAMACHO: What we have
now, tacos, both the tortillas,
bigger. They have a lot

26:50.042 --> 26:54.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of meat. They have a lot of fat.
Sometimes, the quesadillas are
deep-fried.

26:54.613 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): People
are on the go, working, so if
you have got money, you

26:59.284 --> 27:02.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to a restaurant. If you
don't, you eat tacos on the
street. And people drink soda,

27:02.988 --> 27:05.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rather than have water.

27:05.324 --> 27:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Maria
Sanchez Perez, who is losing her
sight and lives in fear of a

27:10.829 --> 27:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stroke, blames her
addiction to Coca-Cola.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA SANCHEZ PEREZ, Diabetes
Sufferer (through translator):
Those big bottles that you see,

27:17.202 --> 27:19.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those wouldn't even
last me a day.

27:19.371 --> 27:25.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She's hardly
alone. According to Coca-Cola,
Mexicans are far and away the

27:25.210 --> 27:31.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
biggest consumers of the
company's products, especially
the flagship Coca-Cola, which is

27:31.016 --> 27:36.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sold in three-liter bottles in
this country. On average, the
company says Mexicans consume

27:36.221 --> 27:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
43 gallons of Coke products per
year. That works out to about 55
of these per person

27:42.494 --> 27:46.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
per year.

27:46.031 --> 27:54.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2014, after a campaign by
citizen activist groups, Mexico
became the first nation to

27:54.706 --> 28:00.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enact a so-called soda tax, 10
percent on sugar-sweetened
drinks, 8 percent on salty

28:00.078 --> 28:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
snacks. In its first year, one
study showed consumption dropped
by 6 percent. But the

28:06.218 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study's methods were questioned
by the food and beverage
industry, led by multinationals

including U.S.- based
Coke and Pepsi.

28:14.293 --> 28:18.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The industry has fought such tax
proposals, successfully in most
cases, including New

28:18.330 --> 28:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
York and San Francisco.

28:20.566 --> 28:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORENA CERDAN, Mexican Consumer
Products Industry Board: It's a
regressive...

28:24.369 --> 28:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's a
regressive tax, is what you're
saying.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORENA CERDAN: It's a
regressive tax, yes.

28:26.405 --> 28:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Lorena
Cerdan is a spokesperson for
Mexico's food and beverage trade
group,

28:31.209 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which argues its products
are unfairly singled out.

28:36.148 --> 28:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's absolutely no link
between soda consumption at 43
gallons per person per year and
the

28:42.854 --> 28:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disease burden of this country?

28:46.158 --> 28:51.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LORENA CERDAN (through
translator): There is no causal
relationship to link directly

28:51.897 --> 28:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sugary drinks with diabetes.
There is a causal relationship
between a sedentary lifestyle

28:56.134 --> 28:59.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and an overconsumption
of calories.

28:59.004 --> 29:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She says the
urbanized lifestyle and overall
increase in calories

29:03.075 --> 29:10.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from many sources
are the problem.

29:10.248 --> 29:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The industry has contributed to
public awareness and fitness
campaigns. But its critics, like

29:14.486 --> 29:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consumer advocate Alejandro
Calvillo, are skeptical.

29:18.123 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEJANDRO CALVILLO, Consumer
Advocate: They are, by this way,
trying to create confusion,

29:23.895 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that you don't have good
products or bad products.
Everything is on the relation of
the calorie

29:30.902 --> 29:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intake that you consume and
the calories that you spend.

29:34.506 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says
there's also been lackluster
enforcement of recent
regulations,

29:39.244 --> 29:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
banning salty snacks and sodas
in schools, for example.

29:43.148 --> 29:47.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAVUTO: All right. This is the
schools in the country that we
have reports that are

29:47.719 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not following the regulation. We
are making a list of the
schools.

29:52.124 --> 29:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And experts
say it's not just at school, but
at home that a culture

29:56.261 --> 30:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shift is needed; 26-year-old
Karla Almanza gets good grades
from her nutritionist at

30:04.169 --> 30:09.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Sugar Clinics for
controlling her weight and sugar
levels. But she says its not
been

30:09.341 --> 30:14.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easy cutting out foods and
sugary drinks she loves and
imposing a diet on her mother,
who

30:14.613 --> 30:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is also diabetic, and two
daughters and her husband, who
are not.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARLA ALMANZA, Diabetes Sufferer
(through translator): For the
children, I have always

30:22.888 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cooked like that. They're used
to it. It's really difficult for
my husband. He says:

30:27.025 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"I'm not a rabbit. Give
me some more meat."

30:30.495 --> 30:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's also
hard on the budget, she says.
The healthy diet, ironically,

30:35.600 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is costlier than fast food.
Helping her budget, her clinic
fees are fixed, payable up front

30:41.940 --> 30:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the full year, though
financing is offered to help
patients afford care.

30:46.678 --> 30:51.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lozano says this ensures
patients come back regularly,
their complications not only
treated,

30:51.516 --> 30:53.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but also tracked.

30:53.752 --> 30:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAVIER LOZANO: We have been on
the -- more than three years in
care and we have seen

30:58.223 --> 31:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 15,000 patients.
So we have a lot of data.

31:02.194 --> 31:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The data
helps determine what works and
what doesn't, which also in

31:06.298 --> 31:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn helps lower costs and
increase access to care in an
epidemic that most experts says

31:11.002 --> 31:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this nation is unprepared for.

31:14.506 --> 31:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam Lazaro in Monterrey,
Mexico.

31:19.411 --> 31:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fred's reporting is
a partnership with the
Under-Told Stories Project at
Saint

31:23.415 --> 31:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mary's University of Minnesota.

31:29.554 --> 31:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
Asian nation of Myanmar, the
country formerly known as

31:41.266 --> 31:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Burma, where Sunday's election
is on track to produce a
landslide victory to the party

31:46.104 --> 31:50.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of former political
prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi.

31:50.075 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We start with a report from John
Irvine of Independent Television
News.

31:54.312 --> 32:01.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: It seems the world
has a new democracy. After years
of brutal repression,

32:01.987 --> 32:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Burma's freedom movement and its
charismatic leader, Aung San Suu
Kyi, have prevailed,

32:06.892 --> 32:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that was something to
celebrate here tonight.

32:11.363 --> 32:18.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: She is genius. She is
genius. She is a great leader.
She is very honest. She is

32:18.804 --> 32:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like father. She is our mother.

32:22.073 --> 32:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: But the day began
differently, with Yangon
strangely subdued. Many heeded

32:29.481 --> 32:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official advice to stay at home.
The joy of yesterday's vote had
been replaced by uncertainty

32:35.053 --> 32:38.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about what might happen next.

32:38.590 --> 32:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, when election officials
didn't show up to announce
results at the appointed time,

32:44.930 --> 32:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was concern that democracy
delayed might be democracy
denied again.

32:51.403 --> 33:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soon, Ms. Suu Kyi appeared at
her party headquarters. She
urged supporters to keep calm
and to remain

33:00.912 --> 33:06.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peaceful. Then, nine hours late,
the first results did come in,
and people were calm

33:06.985 --> 33:09.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
no more.

33:09.087 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:13.158 --> 33:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: Not long ago, just
being a member of this political
party was a jailable offense.

33:24.035 --> 33:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aung San Suu Kyi served a total
of 15 years in custody. Now the
former prisoner is poised

33:28.139 --> 33:29.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to become (INAUDIBLE)

33:29.474 --> 33:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the five years since Ms. Suu
Kyi's release, many new faces
have turned up here, businessmen

33:35.447 --> 33:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and tourists for whom part of
the appeal of this place is its
timeless quality. The flip

33:41.319 --> 33:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side is that many Burmese
live in a time forgot.

33:47.158 --> 33:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Slums like this are commonplace.
Home is a tiny stilted shack
teetering over swampland.

33:54.799 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are the people Aung San
Suu Kyi has promised to help.
Ms. Suu Kyi's next burden

34:00.238 --> 34:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is expectation. But after
decades of struggle, she has put
herself in a position to
deliver.

34:07.279 --> 34:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democracy has won through here,
a thrilling prospect for people
impatient for a future.

34:14.619 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we take a
closer look at Myanmar's
historic election with Tom
Malinowski.

34:19.958 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the assistant secretary of
state for democracy, human
rights and labor.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to the program.

34:26.264 --> 34:26.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for
Democracy, Human Rights and
Labor:

34:26.164 --> 34:28.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is the
opposition win clear? Is there
any doubt that they on the track

34:30.201 --> 34:31.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to victory?

34:31.803 --> 34:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Well, we don't
have the official results yet.

34:35.941 --> 34:42.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's important to remember
that, under the system in Burma,
the military is reserved

34:42.147 --> 34:47.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 25 percent of the seats in
Parliament, which means her
party, the NLD, would have

34:47.652 --> 34:52.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to win two-thirds of the
contested seats in order to get
a majority and to form a
government.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we don't know if they
have done that yet.

34:54.659 --> 34:57.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it appear --
some of the early reporting
indicates that it looks like

34:57.329 --> 34:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's where they're headed.

34:59.364 --> 35:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Well, I don't
want to make predictions as to
numbers.

35:02.600 --> 35:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what -- it is important
to step back, though, and to
remember that this was a day

35:09.307 --> 35:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
25 years in coming. A lot of
people in Burma sacrificed and
many died to get to this day.

35:14.813 --> 35:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the United States, for all
of that period of time,
supported the hope, the dream
that

35:21.553 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one day the Burmese people would
be able to make the choice that
they did today.

35:26.624 --> 35:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are still enormous
problems. Burma is not yet a
full-fledged democracy, but I

35:31.796 --> 35:36.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think this does show us that
where we are principled and
patient and persistent in
pursuit

35:36.668 --> 35:39.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of that goal, we can
make a difference.

35:39.571 --> 35:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, if Ms. Suu
Kyi's party does obtain the
two-thirds that you just
described,

35:45.043 --> 35:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is it -- are you confident, is
the United States confident that
the military rulers

35:48.880 --> 35:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to let her and her
party essentially take over?

35:53.752 --> 35:56.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Well, we take
absolutely nothing for granted.
This has been a tough struggle

35:56.721 --> 36:00.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Burma for many
years, as I mentioned.

36:00.291 --> 36:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the military has promised,
including the commander in chief
just in the last few days,

36:04.896 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they will respect the
results. And I think, having
gone this far, I think it will

36:09.334 --> 36:13.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be quite hard for them
to turn back now.

36:13.605 --> 36:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the
chief challenges going forward,
whoever is victorious in the

36:17.108 --> 36:17.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Parliament?

36:17.909 --> 36:20.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Well,
there are several.

36:20.712 --> 36:27.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, the country is still
operating under a non-democratic
constitution, which gives

36:27.352 --> 36:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the military, as I mentioned, a
quarter of the seats in
Parliament, which gives them,

36:32.290 --> 36:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually, a veto power over
changes in the constitution, the
right to appoint the interior

36:36.394 --> 36:38.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ministers.

36:38.663 --> 36:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police in Burma still
answers to the military and not
to the civilian government. The
constitution,

36:44.235 --> 36:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aung San Suu Kyi and her party
have said, will need to change.
And that's something

36:48.339 --> 36:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have -- we, the United
States, have called for us as
well.

36:52.377 --> 36:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's perhaps the
deepest and most difficult
problem, and that is that, well,

36:57.449 --> 36:59.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
one of the flaws of this
election was that hundreds of
thousands of people, the
Rohingya

36:59.717 --> 37:00.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Muslims...

37:00.085 --> 37:01.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: ... who had
previously been able to vote in
Burma, had lived there for

37:05.924 --> 37:12.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
generations, were
disenfranchised, were denied the
vote, because of a really
virulent, racist

37:12.831 --> 37:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign that was staged we
think in part to try to deny the
opposition a victory in

37:19.137 --> 37:21.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election.

37:21.406 --> 37:27.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But that racism, that
intolerance that was created for
the purpose of this election is

37:27.045 --> 37:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still out there. And those
people are still suffering a
great deal.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, we know there was some
criticism of Ms. Suu Kyi and

37:33.918 --> 37:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the things that she and
her party did during this
campaign. That seems to be

37:39.090 --> 37:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being overlooked right now
in this early celebrating.

37:43.361 --> 37:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Well, it looks
to me like, when people were in
the privacy of the voting

37:48.433 --> 37:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
booth, after all of these years
of waiting for this day, they
saw a choice between the

37:54.539 --> 37:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past and the future, and despite
everything that has happened and
everything that has

37:59.110 --> 38:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been said, it looks like most
Burmese are focused on moving
forward.

38:02.881 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in the next
few days, Secretary Malinowski,
what does the United States look

38:06.184 --> 38:08.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for? What are you looking
for to come out of Burma?

38:08.953 --> 38:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Well, first, we
want to wait and see what the
election observers say about

38:12.457 --> 38:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the conduct of the elections. We
will know that, I think,
tomorrow.

38:16.461 --> 38:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We supported a program in which
thousands of observers fanned
out across the country

38:22.133 --> 38:26.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to make sure that these
elections were properly run.
Then there will be a long period
of political

38:26.337 --> 38:28.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transition.

38:28.606 --> 38:34.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, depending on the results, we
will want to see that the
military, as you suggested,

38:34.946 --> 38:41.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will respect them, will allow a
civilian government to be
formed, and ultimately that
those civilians

38:41.352 --> 38:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will have control, and that the
military will gradually step
back and play a more appropriate

38:45.456 --> 38:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
role for a democratic country.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Assistance
Secretary Tom Malinowski, thank
you.

38:49.093 --> 38:53.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM MALINOWSKI: Thank you.

38:53.898 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We may still be a
whole year out from the
presidential election here, but
to

39:10.815 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hear one candidate tell it, the
scrutiny has never been higher.

39:15.386 --> 39:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while one GOP front-runner
took issue with the media, the
other took center stage

39:18.723 --> 39:21.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the comedy circuit.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where we begin
this Politics Monday.

39:24.095 --> 39:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: So, why are you
hosting Saturday Night Live?

39:28.166 --> 39:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why? And the answer is, I have
really nothing better to do.

39:33.004 --> 39:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump is by
no means the first politician to
use late-night comedy

39:37.742 --> 39:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make his or her case. They're
everywhere this year, day and
night, dancing with Ellen,

39:44.616 --> 39:49.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sparring with Stephen,
yukking it up with Jimmy.

39:49.354 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIMMY FALLON, Host, "The Tonight
Show With Jimmy Fallon":
Congratulations. You're speaking

39:49.587 --> 39:51.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Donald Trump.

39:51.890 --> 39:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Washington Post
reporter Elahe Izadi says the
ability to showcase a sense

39:56.794 --> 40:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of humor has become a campaign
essential, as important as
delivering a policy speech.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELAHE IZADI, The Washington
Post: This is now part of just
being on the campaign trail.

40:06.604 --> 40:10.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't just something that
is an extra. This is part of
what it means to be a national

40:10.775 --> 40:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political candidate, for better
or for worse, is to have the
willingness to go on these

40:14.946 --> 40:20.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shows and allow yourself to be
made fun of and also just appear
very, very silly.

40:20.218 --> 40:26.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The tradition
stretches back decades. John F.
Kennedy showed up on Jack Paar's
"Tonight

40:26.858 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Show" in 1960. In 1968, two
months before Richard Nixon was
elected president, he memorably

40:33.298 --> 40:35.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appeared on "Rowan &amp;
Martin's Laugh-In."

40:35.199 --> 40:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD NIXON, Presidential
Candidate: Sock it to me?

40:36.334 --> 40:38.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:38.469 --> 40:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in 1992, Bill
Clinton slipped on dark glasses
and a saxophone for a visit

40:43.741 --> 40:48.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Arsenio Hall's
late-night show.

40:48.479 --> 40:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Obama became the
first sitting president to take
to the couch when he visited

40:54.185 --> 41:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jay Leno's "Tonight Show" in
2009. Such appearances almost
always stir objection, some of
it about

41:00.792 --> 41:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questioning the candidate's
dignity, much of it from other
candidates seeking equal

41:03.995 --> 41:07.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

41:07.632 --> 41:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Immigration activists took it up
a notch at Rockefeller Center
this weekend, offering

41:12.036 --> 41:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a reward for anyone who would
disrupt Trump's "SNL"
appearance. In the end, they
settled

41:16.341 --> 41:21.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for protesting offstage,
outside the studio.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we turn now, as always, to
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report and Tamara Keith

41:23.915 --> 41:25.983 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of NPR.

41:25.983 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, as we look at
this, laughing, some of it
funny, some of it not so much,

41:30.321 --> 41:33.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who's winning these
comedy wars, Amy?

41:33.257 --> 41:35.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well, I think that you
set it up quite well in the

41:35.860 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
piece, which is, the point is to
make these people who spend most
of their time in very

41:40.898 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contrived situations look
natural and normal, like this is
just your best friend talking

41:44.635 --> 41:47.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you.

41:47.038 --> 41:51.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And each of them has a different
reason to go do these shows. If
you're one of the candidates

41:51.008 --> 41:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that doesn't get a whole lot of
attention, here is a chance to
get in front of a new

41:54.011 --> 41:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
audience that might not have
paid any attention to you.

41:56.981 --> 42:00.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton, two of the best known
candidates, if you look

42:00.218 --> 42:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the polling, they have one
thing in common. And that is
voters think they're not likable

42:05.990 --> 42:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or easy-going. So what better
way to do it than go on one of
these shows?

42:08.626 --> 42:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is it working?

42:10.361 --> 42:13.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's free media. That's
for sure.

42:13.297 --> 42:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton's campaign
after she went on "SNL," the
next day or a couple of days

42:18.302 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
later, there was an event, and
at the event they were blasting
that skit up onto the screen

42:23.674 --> 42:26.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a loop. They liked it. At one
point, she told somebody in the
audience, well, you can

42:26.477 --> 42:29.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
call me Val.

42:29.614 --> 42:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is this idea in campaigns
that voters are likely to vote
for the person who they

42:35.453 --> 42:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would like to have a beer with.
Well, one way to look like you
would be someone fun

42:40.391 --> 42:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have a beer with is to show
up on late-night TV as a
bartender or...

42:44.262 --> 42:45.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: I have never
understood how that works with
the presidency. But that's a
different

42:45.630 --> 42:45.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conversation.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:47.832 --> 42:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to talk now
about scrutiny, because we have
had a couple of major
candidates,

42:53.638 --> 42:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ben Carson and Marco Rubio, who
came under heightened scrutiny
because of things they

42:58.109 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have said, things they
have done in their past.

43:01.078 --> 43:06.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wonder whether it feels
different or this is the way it
always is? Before you answer

43:06.417 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that question, let's listen to
what Ben Carson had to say about
this whole issue.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

43:11.122 --> 43:14.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: There's no question
I'm getting special scrutiny,

43:14.725 --> 43:19.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because there are lot of people
who are very threatened, and
then they have seen the recent

43:19.931 --> 43:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
head-to-head polling against
Hillary and how well I do. And
they are worried.

43:24.335 --> 43:27.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the whole point
is to distract.

43:27.572 --> 43:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And he insists he's
being scrutinized like no one
ever has.

43:31.542 --> 43:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No one has ever been
under this level of scrutiny --
I don't know. I have

43:34.412 --> 43:37.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spent a little time watching
other campaigns. This is very
typical.

43:37.949 --> 43:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the thing about this
election. There's stuff about
this election that we have never

43:42.453 --> 43:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen before and doesn't make a
whole lot of sense. But, as I
have been talking about
throughout

43:46.791 --> 43:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year, at some point, the
laws of the road, the political
rules of the road start

43:49.760 --> 43:52.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to apply.

43:52.396 --> 43:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of those is, the higher
up you go in the process, the
longer you're the front-runner,

43:56.734 --> 43:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the more scrutiny you're going
to get. There is absolutely
nothing new about this. And

43:59.470 --> 44:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the problem for Ben Carson is,
his autobiography is his
campaign.

44:03.908 --> 44:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, of course that's the place
where the scrutiny is going to
be the most significant. It also

44:08.112 --> 44:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't help him that he doesn't
have any real specific policy
objectives. So, if he

44:12.717 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants to talk about policy,
that's great. Then he has got to
get more specific about

44:15.152 --> 44:17.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those policies.

44:17.388 --> 44:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marco Rubio knew
what was coming, which is that
people were going to use --
raise

44:21.359 --> 44:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions about his handling of
party-issued credit cards in
Florida when he was speaker

44:26.297 --> 44:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Florida House. And he
came prepared with an answer.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Marco Rubio is
running a very professional
campaign.

44:33.070 --> 44:37.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a candidate who did some
oppo research on himself, did
the opposition research, knew

44:37.108 --> 44:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what was coming, and had an
answer, and, in fact, made this
credit card thing sort of

44:42.013 --> 44:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of his overall narrative,
which is, I wasn't a rich guy, I
was living paycheck to

44:45.917 --> 44:49.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paycheck, just like
everybody else.

44:49.387 --> 44:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really just blended it in
with the story of Marco Rubio.
And I think that he played

44:56.160 --> 44:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it well. And in some ways, he's
inoculating themselves. This
comes out now. He isn't even

44:59.297 --> 45:01.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a front-runner at this
point. It comes out now.

45:01.465 --> 45:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It will just
seem like old news.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And it will seem
like old news. And, in fact, it
sort of is old news, because

45:05.436 --> 45:07.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it came out in his
2010 Senate race.

45:07.638 --> 45:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And it should be
said, both of them have been on
e-mail raising money.

45:10.474 --> 45:11.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Raising
money off of this.

45:11.642 --> 45:12.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, yes.

45:12.076 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And it's always...

45:12.810 --> 45:15.012 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: The
media is after me.

45:15.012 --> 45:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And, as you said,
there is something about the
scrutiny, that it happens every

45:20.217 --> 45:24.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
single election. So is the
attack on the media: Give me
money because the media is
unfairly

45:24.322 --> 45:26.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
maligning me.

45:26.324 --> 45:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And Ben Carson
said that, in just last week,
while the media was going

45:29.627 --> 45:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after him, he raised $3.5
million from 10,000 people.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Throw me in the
briar patch, right? It's like,
oh, this is so terrible what
you're

45:35.433 --> 45:35.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing to me.

45:35.833 --> 45:36.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:36.000 --> 45:37.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

45:37.301 --> 45:39.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The perils
of front-runner-itis.

45:39.103 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about the Democrats
for a while, because one of the
interesting things we're

45:42.273 --> 45:47.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing happening with Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders in
particular is daylight is

45:47.044 --> 45:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening -- is opening between
these two candidates, who
promised -- at least he had

45:50.581 --> 45:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promised that he wasn't really
interested in attacking Hillary
Clinton.

45:53.818 --> 45:55.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I still don't think
he's interested in attacking
Hillary Clinton.

45:55.553 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Really?

45:57.021 --> 46:04.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: No, I mean, when you
see him go on the offense, it's
still very light. And

46:04.128 --> 46:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's still very much about,
listen, I'm just going to put
myself out here. I leave it for

46:09.033 --> 46:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you to judge whether or not
Hillary Clinton's been as
consistent.

46:12.837 --> 46:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, look, to Hillary Clinton's
credit, she keeps moving further
and further on to Bernie

46:20.144 --> 46:27.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders' terrain and moving
further and further to the left.
He's not giving her easy
openings.

46:27.151 --> 46:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he has to make is the
argument that she's not been
consistent in her support, as
opposed

46:30.888 --> 46:34.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to she doesn't support
certain issues.

46:34.392 --> 46:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. He seems to
be making the argument that: I
was right all along. I was

46:37.662 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right first.

46:39.897 --> 46:44.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't say her name. And he
doesn't actually see this as an
attack. He sees this as fair

46:44.301 --> 46:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
game, drawing a contrast.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Comparison, yes.

46:47.371 --> 46:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Comparison. He
thinks that's completely fair.

46:50.708 --> 46:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that his campaign would
like him to push harder, but
he's just not quite as
comfortable

46:56.981 --> 47:02.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with it. And Hillary Clinton has
really no need to overtly go on
the attack against Bernie

47:02.887 --> 47:03.888 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders.

47:03.888 --> 47:06.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Only a
few seconds left.

47:06.090 --> 47:09.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got another debate, yet
another debate tomorrow night.
What are you watching for?

47:09.360 --> 47:14.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Let's see about the
Ben Carson scrutiny and where we
go with that. He's certainly

47:14.198 --> 47:16.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be much -- it's
much more of a focus.

47:16.434 --> 47:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Donald Trump has
certainly been going out of his
way to remind everybody

47:18.703 --> 47:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of what all the questions are.

47:21.138 --> 47:23.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And all eyes
on Marco Rubio. Will he have
another strong performance in

47:23.107 --> 47:23.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this debate?

47:23.808 --> 47:25.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

47:25.976 --> 47:28.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we will be watching, or
something. I will let you watch
and tell me all about it.

47:28.412 --> 47:29.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:29.146 --> 47:30.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: The next
time we see you, yes.

47:30.648 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amy Walter, Tamara
Keith, thank you very much.

47:39.123 --> 47:44.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thanks.

47:44.195 --> 47:51.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She is a writer,
editor, but, above all, a
feminist activist.

47:51.635 --> 47:55.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gloria Steinem has been in the
forefront of the women's
movement in this country for
more

47:55.506 --> 48:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than half-a-century. Now at 81,
she has penned her memoir, "My
Life on the Road," our newest

48:01.579 --> 48:04.648 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
addition to the
"NewsHour" bookshelf.

48:04.648 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She talked to Jeffrey Brown
recently at the historic
Sewall-Belmont House and Museum
of

48:09.754 --> 48:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the women's suffrage and equal
rights movement here in
Washington.

48:13.357 --> 48:18.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write here
early on about your father, who
taught you something through

48:18.028 --> 48:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his -- quote -- "ability to live
with and even love insecurity."

48:22.700 --> 48:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's an interesting trait.

48:25.136 --> 48:27.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM, Author, "My Life
on the Road": Well, it certainly
was necessary for a freelance

48:27.938 --> 48:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
writer like me, but I didn't
know that at the time.

48:31.976 --> 48:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just thought that that's the
way life was. And he always
said, "If I don't know what's

48:35.713 --> 48:38.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to happen tomorrow,
it could be wonderful."

48:38.482 --> 48:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that became
your life in a sense, or
something you could live by?

48:43.087 --> 48:45.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, not quite,
because, of course, you want to
be like the other kids,

48:45.823 --> 48:46.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

48:46.557 --> 48:48.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:48.459 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: So, I looked at
the movies and I saw how kids
went to school and fathers

48:51.428 --> 48:54.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had jobs.

48:54.265 --> 49:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but my parents were kind
and loving and wonderful people,
so I was lucky in that

49:01.572 --> 49:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way. And I, of course, didn't
know yet that the idea of living
with insecurity would be

49:06.811 --> 49:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really helpful in later life,
both as a writer and a person in
movements.

49:12.550 --> 49:16.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write a book
about life on the road. When you
look back now, does

49:16.987 --> 49:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it look like it was a life that
you chose? Or did it just
happen, unfold?

49:22.927 --> 49:25.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: You know,
that's a deep question.

49:25.029 --> 49:26.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Good.

49:26.163 --> 49:28.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:28.232 --> 49:34.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: I think both,
because what we grow up with
feels like home. So, in that

49:34.371 --> 49:38.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sense, it was destined.

49:38.175 --> 49:44.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also spent all the middle
years of my life assuming that I
would have to settle

49:44.481 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down and live like everybody
else. And it was only after I
had been living this on-the-road

49:49.386 --> 49:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life for quite a long time, I
mean, until I was 50, that I
realized, wait a minute,

49:55.993 --> 49:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this isn't just something on the
way to something else. This is
it.

49:57.895 --> 49:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is it.

49:58.896 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Yes, right.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This
is who you are.

50:01.065 --> 50:01.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GLORIA STEINEM: Yes.

50:01.799 --> 50:03.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sure.

50:03.701 --> 50:08.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: And that --
well, I think, in a real way,
because my father had no home,

50:08.038 --> 50:15.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, he was a total wanderer,
and my mother had no journey of
her own, because she had

50:15.479 --> 50:19.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give up the career as a
writer and a journalist, and,
you know, she kind of gave up
everything

50:19.216 --> 50:21.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she loved.

50:21.352 --> 50:27.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it took me while to realize
that it isn't either/or. It's
and.

50:27.324 --> 50:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about today?
Do you see the same commitment,
the same focus in young

50:32.196 --> 50:33.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women?

50:33.464 --> 50:37.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GLORIA STEINEM: Oh, yes,
more, way, way, way more.

50:37.501 --> 50:43.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were like 12 crazy ladies in
the beginning. You know, we were
definitely the core of
something,

50:43.974 --> 50:50.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but not the something. And now
all of these issues are majority
issues. And young women

50:50.047 --> 50:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are way more likely to just
assume that they are going to be
likely to use all of their

50:54.285 --> 50:57.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human talents.

50:57.655 --> 51:02.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, they get radicalized as
they get older, because they get
into the labor force,

51:02.860 --> 51:05.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they discover that maybe
equal pay is not happening.

51:05.629 --> 51:08.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, the idea that
we're in a post-feminist
society?

51:08.732 --> 51:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GLORIA STEINEM: Oh,
that's ridiculous.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ridiculous.

51:11.302 --> 51:14.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Ridiculous. You
know who's saying that? I can
guarantee you they're the

51:14.638 --> 51:20.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same people who were saying to
me in the beginning, you can't
do this. It's against God,
Freud,

51:20.844 --> 51:21.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
somebody.

51:21.612 --> 51:23.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:23.881 --> 51:30.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: And now the new
form of obstructionism is to
say, well, it's over, you know,
just

51:30.187 --> 51:31.822 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to keep you from
doing anything more.

51:31.822 --> 51:34.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so just begun.

51:34.491 --> 51:37.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book tells
about many successes along the
way. I'm wondering about what
you

51:37.561 --> 51:40.230 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
think of as the
greatest failures.

51:40.230 --> 51:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: The confidence
to tell the truth about our
lives.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Meaning?

51:44.668 --> 51:49.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, for
instance, one in three American
women has needed at some time

51:49.506 --> 51:56.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in her life an abortion. And
there's still enough shame to
it, or, you know, controversy

51:56.547 --> 52:01.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least, so that it's difficult
for people to say that.

52:01.318 --> 52:05.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you look at
things like abortion rights,
outlawing discrimination

52:05.689 --> 52:12.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the workplace, a lot of
successes along the way, but,
even now, on the defensive in

52:12.129 --> 52:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some areas, right, as these
battles unfold in statehouses.
They continue to unfold.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, yes.

52:19.970 --> 52:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, the people who are
against reproductive freedom
kind of lost what they wanted in
Washington,

52:25.843 --> 52:30.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so now they are striving to
gain it in state legislatures.

52:30.781 --> 52:35.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But opponents of
these things -- and this has
been the case for all your

52:35.719 --> 52:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, I'm sure -- come to these
issues with the same certainty
that you do, the same sense

52:40.858 --> 52:43.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of being right as you.

52:43.994 --> 52:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Well, but here's
the difference. We are
protecting their rights.

52:50.501 --> 52:55.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are protecting --
reproductive freedom protects
the right to have children. They

52:55.339 --> 52:59.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not protecting our right to
decide when and whether to have
children.

52:59.510 --> 53:04.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you,
finally, are you able to imagine
yourself as a young woman

53:04.548 --> 53:07.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in today's society? You're with
young women all the time. You're
still talking to them.

53:07.951 --> 53:08.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GLORIA STEINEM: Yes.

53:08.118 --> 53:08.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

JEFFREY BROWN: What advice
do you give to them?

53:10.888 --> 53:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GLORIA STEINEM: Here's my
advice: Do not listen to me.

(LAUGHTER)

53:14.058 --> 53:15.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GLORIA STEINEM: Really.

53:15.225 --> 53:16.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do not?

53:16.593 --> 53:19.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GLORIA STEINEM: No.

53:19.363 --> 53:25.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I want to support their
listening to themselves. Each of
them has things that they love,
things

53:25.369 --> 53:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they do that they love so
much, they forget what time it
is, which is a good measure,

53:29.373 --> 53:33.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when they're doing it.

53:33.143 --> 53:39.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They know their own life and
situations. I'm here to support
that and say, OK you're --
you're

53:39.750 --> 53:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not -- OK, you're not more
important than somebody else,
but you're not less important

53:42.753 --> 53:43.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
either.

53:43.821 --> 53:46.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,

GWEN IFILL: You don't find a lot
of people who will say, "Do not
listen to me," after

53:51.895 --> 53:53.363 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
all this time on
the public stage.

53:53.363 --> 53:55.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You sure don't.

53:55.299 --> 53:57.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boy, she's been fighting those
battles all this time, but still
-- still seems to have

53:57.601 --> 53:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the energy to keep fighting.

53:58.335 --> 53:59.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

53:59.937 --> 54:02.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
