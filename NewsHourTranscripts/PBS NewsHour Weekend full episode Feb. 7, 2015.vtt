00:59.359 --> 01:01.428
ESCALATING TEN-MONTH CONFLICT IN

01:01.428 --> 01:02.663
EASTERN UKRAINE.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.031
THIS AS THE UNITED STATES AND

01:04.031 --> 01:05.332
NATO CONSIDER WHETHER TO SEND

01:05.332 --> 01:06.767
ARMS TO THE PRO-WESTERN

01:06.767 --> 01:08.502
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT TO HELP IT

01:08.502 --> 01:10.037
THWART AN OFFENSIVE BY PRO-

01:10.037 --> 01:11.305
RUSSIAN REBELS.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.539
IT'S AN IDEA THAT ONE OF

01:12.539 --> 01:14.274
AMERICA'S MOST RELIABLE ALLIES,

01:14.274 --> 01:18.245
GERMANY, HAS RESISTED.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.112
>> (translated): I THINK THE

01:19.112 --> 01:20.681
PROGRESS THAT UKRAINE NEEDS

01:20.681 --> 01:22.182
CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY MORE

01:22.182 --> 01:22.983
WEAPONS.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.284
I REALLY DOUBT THAT.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.319
I REALLY DOUBT IT.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.920
I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.422
>> Stewart: AND RUSSIAN FOREIGN

MINISTER SERGEI LAVROV WARNED

01:30.223 --> 01:32.125
THE WEST AGAINST SENDING MORE

01:32.125 --> 01:34.127
ARMS.

01:34.127 --> 01:34.962
>> (translated): THERE ARE

01:34.962 --> 01:36.897
GROWING APPEALS IN THE WEST TO

01:36.897 --> 01:38.231
SUPPORT KIEV'S POLICY OF

01:38.231 --> 01:40.133
MILITARIZATION, TO PUMP UKRAINE

01:40.133 --> 01:41.802
FULL OF LETHAL WEAPONS AND TO

01:41.802 --> 01:43.303
BRING IT INTO NATO.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.738
THIS WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THE

01:44.738 --> 01:46.440
TRAGEDY OF UKRAINE.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.507
>> Stewart: BUT VICE PRESIDENT

01:47.507 --> 01:49.810
JOE BIDEN RESPONDED THIS WAY:

01:49.810 --> 01:51.411
>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

01:51.411 --> 01:52.579
UKRAINE WITH SECURITY

01:52.579 --> 01:56.516
ASSISTANCE, NOT TO ENCOURAGE WAR

01:56.516 --> 01:58.352
BUT TO ALLOW UKRAINE TO DEFEND

01:58.352 --> 01:59.753
ITSELF.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.723
LET ME BE CLEAR: WE DO NOT

02:02.723 --> 02:04.224
BELIEVE THERE IS A MILITARY

02:04.224 --> 02:06.693
SOLUTION IN UKRAINE.

02:06.693 --> 02:09.129
BUT LET ME BE EQUALLY CLEAR: WE

02:09.129 --> 02:10.497
DO NOT BELIEVE RUSSIA HAS THE

02:10.497 --> 02:13.300
RIGHT TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.067
>> Stewart: TODAY, AT THAT

02:50.170 --> 02:51.338
THE IRAQI CAPITAL HAD BEEN

02:51.338 --> 02:52.672
RELATIVELY CALM IN RECENT

02:52.672 --> 02:54.207

ANTI-SHIP ROCKET THAT IT SAID

04:19.693 --> 04:20.894
NUMBER OF PEOPLE DRIVING WITH

04:20.894 --> 04:22.562
BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVELS EXCEEDING

04:22.562 --> 04:25.065
THE LEGAL LIMIT, .08, HAS

04:25.065 --> 04:27.834
DECLINED BY 30% SINCE 2007 AND

04:27.834 --> 04:29.669
80% SINCE THE FIRST SURVEY IN

04:29.669 --> 04:31.238
1973.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.506
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SAME

04:32.506 --> 04:34.007
SURVEY FOUND THAT DRIVING UNDER

04:34.007 --> 04:35.775
THE INFLUENCE OF MARIJUANA AND

04:35.775 --> 04:37.511
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CONTINUES TO

04:37.511 --> 04:38.712
RISE.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.522
>> Stewart: AS WE REPORTED

04:48.522 --> 04:50.090
EARLIER, WORLD LEADERS HAVE BEEN

04:50.090 --> 04:51.458
MEETING TO TRY TO END THE

04:51.458 --> 04:53.093
FIGHTING IN EASTERN UKRAINE.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.261
FOR MORE ON THE SITUATION IN

04:54.261 --> 04:55.795
UKRAINE, WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA

04:55.795 --> 04:57.597
SKYPE FROM DONETSK BY PETER

04:57.597 --> 04:58.999
LEONARD, WHO IS REPORTING THERE

04:58.999 --> 05:00.867
FOR THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.836
PETER, ONE OF THE MORE STRIKING

05:02.836 --> 05:04.437
EVENTS THAT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY

05:04.437 --> 05:06.139
IS IN THE SMALL DOWN OF-- AND

05:06.139 --> 05:06.907
I'M GOING TO TRY TO SAY THIS

05:06.907 --> 05:09.309
CORRECTLY-- DEBALTSEVE, IS THAT

05:09.309 --> 05:11.411
THE FIGHTING CEASED FOR A SHORT

05:11.411 --> 05:13.046
PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT CIVILIANS

05:13.046 --> 05:14.114
COULD EVACUATE.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.916
BOTH SIDES STOPPED FIGHTING.

05:15.916 --> 05:16.883
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT'S THE

05:16.883 --> 05:18.818
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS TOWN, AND

05:18.818 --> 05:20.387
WHY STOP THE FIGHTING?

05:20.387 --> 05:21.254
>> WELL, TO BEGIN WITH, THE

05:21.254 --> 05:22.556
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TOWN IS

05:22.556 --> 05:26.092
ESSENTIALLY THAT IT LIES ALONG A

05:26.092 --> 05:28.295
RAILWAY LINE THAT CONNECTS THE

05:28.295 --> 05:31.097
TWO MAIN REBEL CITIES.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.567
AND SO, IF THESE REBEL

05:33.567 --> 05:35.302
TERRITORIES ARE EVER TO BE

05:35.302 --> 05:37.504
ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE AND TO

05:37.504 --> 05:40.140
EXIST AS INDEPENDENT ENTITIES AS

05:40.140 --> 05:41.341
THEY WOULD LIKE, THEY REALLY

05:41.341 --> 05:42.509
HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THE

05:42.509 --> 05:44.544
TRAPPINGS OF AN ACTUAL

05:44.544 --> 05:46.813
FUNCTIONAL STATE, WHICH IS TO

05:46.813 --> 05:47.981
SAY, A TRANSPORTATION

05:47.981 --> 05:51.017
INFRASTRUCTURE AND VARIOUS OTHER

05:51.017 --> 05:53.153
KINDS OF INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.055
AND SO, THIS IS WHY THE REBEL

05:55.055 --> 05:56.690
OFFENSIVE HAS CONCENTRATED SO

05:56.690 --> 05:59.259
MUCH ON CAPTURING THIS CITY.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.828
NOW, IN WHAT CAME AS KIND OF A

06:01.828 --> 06:04.297
CLEARLY UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT, THE

06:04.297 --> 06:06.132
UKRAINIAN AND THE REBEL SIDE

06:06.132 --> 06:08.134
AGREED TO SUSPEND HOSTILITIES

06:08.134 --> 06:09.903
FOR A FEW HOURS YESTERDAY SO

06:09.903 --> 06:12.205
THAT THE CIVILIANS WHO HAVE

06:12.205 --> 06:13.807
REMAINED IN THE CITY COULD BE

06:13.807 --> 06:14.641
EVACUATED.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.444
THE TOWN HAS BEEN ON THE

06:17.444 --> 06:18.945
RECEIVING END OF SUSTAINED

06:18.945 --> 06:20.714
SHELLING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW,

06:20.714 --> 06:22.048
BUT ESPECIALLY INTENSIVE

06:22.048 --> 06:23.617
SHELLING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF

06:23.617 --> 06:24.384
WEEKS.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.352
>> Stewart: THE HUMANITARIAN

06:25.352 --> 06:26.620
CRISIS IS GROWING; ABOUT A

06:26.620 --> 06:28.088
MILLION PEOPLE ARE DISPLACED AT

06:28.088 --> 06:28.822
THIS POINT.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.357
IS THERE ANYTHING BEING DONE ON

06:30.357 --> 06:31.658
THE GROUND TO ADDRESS THIS

06:31.658 --> 06:32.525
CRISIS?

06:32.525 --> 06:33.627
>> IN FACT, THE NUMBER OF

06:33.627 --> 06:34.794
DISPLACED PEOPLE IS ACTUALLY A

06:34.794 --> 06:35.795
HIGHER THAN JUST A MILLION.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.397
IT'S NOW ABOUT A MILLION WITHIN

06:37.397 --> 06:38.732
UKRAINE ITSELF AND ANOTHER

06:38.732 --> 06:40.667
600,000, ACCORDING TO U.N.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.535
FIGURES, WHO'VE LEFT THE

06:42.535 --> 06:45.105
COUNTRY, MOSTLY TO RUSSIA.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.440
AND AS I SAY, THE EFFORTS ARE

06:47.440 --> 06:48.842
MAINLY CONCENTRATED ON

06:48.842 --> 06:51.511
RESETTLING THOSE PEOPLE WHO'VE

06:51.511 --> 06:54.514
SOUGHT SHELTER IN SAFER AREAS,

06:54.514 --> 06:56.916
ALTHOUGH, AS FAR AS UKRAINE IS

06:56.916 --> 06:59.019
CONCERNED, WITH THE DISASTROUS

06:59.019 --> 07:00.120
STATE OF ITS ECONOMY, IT'S

07:00.120 --> 07:02.922
REALLY SORT OF STRAINING TO

07:02.922 --> 07:05.825
SUPPORT THIS HUGE DISPLACEMENT

07:05.825 --> 07:06.660
OF PEOPLE.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.194
RUSSIA, CLEARLY, HAS GREATER

07:08.194 --> 07:09.663
RESOURCES IN THAT RESPECT.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.530
>> Stewart: AND WHAT IS THE

07:10.530 --> 07:11.865
SITUATION IN DONETSK, WHERE YOU

07:11.865 --> 07:12.732
ARE?

07:12.732 --> 07:13.900
>> REALLY, IT SORT OF VARIES

07:13.900 --> 07:15.068
FROM DAY TO DAY.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.403
AND EVEN AS I'M TALKING TO YOU,

07:16.403 --> 07:18.371
FROM TIME TO TIME, I HEAR SOUNDS

07:18.371 --> 07:20.373
OF OUTGOING SHELLING.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.208

07:25.712 --> 07:26.913
GERMANY'S CHANCELLOR, HAS SAID

07:26.913 --> 07:27.981
SHE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS WILL

07:27.981 --> 07:30.350
END ON MILITARY LINES, WHEREAS

07:30.350 --> 07:32.352
THE UNITED STATES IS CONSIDERING

07:32.352 --> 07:34.354

07:34.354 --> 07:36.423
SUPPORTERS.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.524
WHY THE DIFFERENCE IN OPINION

07:37.524 --> 07:39.159
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EUROPE?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.327
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE

07:40.327 --> 07:41.928
THING IS, I SUPPOSE EUROPE FEELS

07:41.928 --> 07:43.129
LIKE IT HAS A RATHER GREATER

07:43.129 --> 07:44.664
STAKE IN THE WHOLE SITUATION.

07:46.866 --> 07:47.801

07:49.869 --> 07:50.937
THOUGH EUROPEAN LEADERS WOULD

07:50.937 --> 07:53.239
RATHER THIS WHOLE PROBLEM WENT

07:53.239 --> 07:53.840
AWAY.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.008
I MEAN, WITH GREECE ON ITS

07:55.008 --> 07:56.976

07:56.976 --> 07:58.211
FEELS LIKE IT HAS MORE THAN

07:58.211 --> 08:00.780
ENOUGH TO COPE WITH.

DANGLING OF POTENTIAL MILITARY

19:23.429 --> 19:24.230
IN THE SUBWAY?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.032
>> SO, WE WANTED TO BUILD THE

19:26.032 --> 19:27.833
FIRST MOLECULAR MAP OF NEW YORK

19:27.833 --> 19:29.168
CITY, KIND OF LIKE A GOOGLE

19:30.770 --> 19:31.837
SEE WHAT MOLECULES ARE PRESENT

19:31.837 --> 19:33.205
AT DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE CITY

19:33.205 --> 19:35.541
TO BETTER CLASSIFY, TRACK AND

19:35.541 --> 19:36.709
UNDERSTAND HOW THE DYNAMICS OF

19:36.709 --> 19:38.144
THE SURFACES THAT WE ALL TOUCH

19:38.144 --> 19:39.779
EVERY DAY, HOW THEY CHANGE OVER

19:39.779 --> 19:40.312
TIME.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.247
BUT TO DO THAT, WE FIRST NEEDED

19:41.247 --> 19:42.048
TO BUILD A BASELINE.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.082
>> Stewart: HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.116
YOU LITERALLY WENT INTO THE

19:44.116 --> 19:45.317
SUBWAY AND START SWABBING?

19:45.317 --> 19:46.185
>> WE DID, INDEED.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.386
SO, WE HAD MIXTURES OF HIGH

19:47.386 --> 19:48.421
SCHOOL STUDENTS, GRADUATE

19:48.421 --> 19:49.688
STUDENTS, PUBLIC HEALTH

19:49.688 --> 19:51.590
STUDENTS, MEDICAL STUDENTS DOWN

19:51.590 --> 19:53.759
SWARMING THE SUBWAY SYSTEM AND

19:53.759 --> 19:55.061
BRINGING NYLON SWABS AND

19:55.061 --> 19:56.695
SWABBING FOR THREE MINUTES TO

19:56.695 --> 19:57.730
COLLECT ENOUGH D.N.A. AND

19:57.730 --> 19:58.531
BRINGING IT BACK UP TO THE

19:58.531 --> 19:59.365
LAB.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.733
WE EXTRACT D.N.A. AND THEN

20:00.733 --> 20:01.767
SEQUENCE IT, ESSENTIALLY

20:01.767 --> 20:03.202
GENERATING TEN BILLION SMALL

20:03.202 --> 20:04.703
MOLECULES OF D.N.A. THAT'S ALL

20:04.703 --> 20:05.838
AROUND THE SUBWAY SYSTEM.

20:05.838 --> 20:06.572
>> Stewart: WHAT WAS THE THING

20:06.572 --> 20:07.506
YOU FOUND THAT YOU THOUGHT, OH,

20:07.506 --> 20:08.974
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT?

20:08.974 --> 20:10.309
>> SO, THE MOST SURPRISING PART

20:10.309 --> 20:12.478
OF THE STUDY WAS THAT ABOUT 48%

20:12.478 --> 20:13.813
OF ALL THE D.N.A. MOLECULES WE

20:13.813 --> 20:15.714
FIND DON'T MATCH ANY ORGANISM

20:15.714 --> 20:17.183
THAT'S KNOWN TO HUMANKIND.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.751
SO, THERE'S REALLY A WEALTH OF

20:18.751 --> 20:20.486
DISCOVERY LITERALLY UNDER OUR

20:20.486 --> 20:21.587
FINGERTIPS THAT WE'VE NEVER

20:21.587 --> 20:23.389
SEEN BEFORE UNTIL THIS STUDY.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.623
>> Stewart: WHAT IS THE

20:24.623 --> 20:27.860
BROADER MISSION OF THIS STUDY?

20:27.860 --> 20:28.861
>> SO, WE'RE TRYING TO... WITH

20:28.861 --> 20:30.129
THIS BASELINE, WE'RE TRYING TO

20:30.129 --> 20:31.964
THEN EXPAND OUT TO SEE HOW DOES

20:31.964 --> 20:34.133
THIS CHANGE WITHIN ONE CITY OVER

20:34.133 --> 20:35.534
TIME, SO YOU CAN LOOK AT SORT OF

20:35.534 --> 20:37.336
SEASONAL SHIFTS OF WHAT HAPPENS

20:37.336 --> 20:38.904
TO WHAT WE CALL THE MICROBIOME,

20:38.904 --> 20:40.239
WHICH IS THE ECOSYSTEM OF

20:40.239 --> 20:41.874
MICROORGANISMS THAT WE ALL TOUCH

20:41.874 --> 20:42.575
EVERY DAY.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.076
AND THEN, ALSO, IN A LARGER

20:44.076 --> 20:46.045
SENSE, WE WANT TO BE SORT OF A

20:46.045 --> 20:47.513
SMART CITY SO THAT WE COULD

20:47.513 --> 20:48.981
USE THIS TO LOOK, ESSENTIALLY,

20:48.981 --> 20:50.950
FOR CHANGES IN THIS BASELINE

20:50.950 --> 20:52.318
THAT MIGHT INDICATE CHANGES FOR

20:52.318 --> 20:53.819
DISEASE SURVEILLANCE OR

20:53.819 --> 20:55.721
POTENTIALLY COULD CONTEXTUALIZE

20:55.721 --> 20:57.289
A BIOTERRORISM EVENT IF IT WERE

20:57.289 --> 20:57.923
TO OCCUR.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.291
>> Stewart: IS THIS SOMETHING

20:59.291 --> 21:00.426
THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER

21:00.426 --> 21:02.027
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS?

21:02.027 --> 21:02.628
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.697
SO, WE... PART OF THE CONTEXT IS

21:04.697 --> 21:05.598
NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CITY OVER

21:05.598 --> 21:07.466
TIME, BUT COMPARING NEW YORK TO

21:07.466 --> 21:08.033
OTHER CITIES.

21:08.033 --> 21:08.968
SO, WE WANT TO... WE

21:08.968 --> 21:10.369
ESSENTIALLY, THERE IS SOME WORK

21:10.369 --> 21:11.437
BEING DONE IN BOSTON.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.205
WE'VE BEGUN SWABBING IN SAO

21:13.205 --> 21:15.141

21:15.141 --> 21:16.809

21:16.809 --> 21:18.043
SOME WORK IS IN HONG KONG.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.245
AND WE ALSO HAVE COLLABORATORS

21:19.245 --> 21:20.079
IN SHANGHAI.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.981
SO, THE LARGER GOAL IS TO REALLY

21:21.981 --> 21:23.916
HAVE MOLECULAR VIEWS OF MANY

21:23.916 --> 21:24.717
CITIES.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.685
>> Stewart: AND, CURIOUS IF THIS

21:26.685 --> 21:29.121
APPLIES IN ANY WAY TO ALL THE

21:29.121 --> 21:30.055
DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING

21:30.055 --> 21:31.223
ABOUT... THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

21:31.223 --> 21:32.124
HAVING ABOUT MEASLES?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.058
>> LOOKING AHEAD WHAT, WE COULD

21:33.058 --> 21:34.960
DO WITH THESE TYPES OF STUDIES

21:34.960 --> 21:36.529
AND THIS TYPE OF DATA IS TO MAKE

21:36.529 --> 21:37.496
IT EVEN FASTER.

21:37.496 --> 21:38.898
SO, THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES-- AND

21:38.898 --> 21:39.565
SOME OF THEM ARE IN MY

21:39.565 --> 21:40.699
LABORATORY TODAY-- WHERE YOU CAN

21:40.699 --> 21:42.902
ACTUALLY SEQUENCE D.N.A. AS IT

21:42.902 --> 21:44.570
APPEARS IN REAL TIME.

21:44.570 --> 21:45.771
SO, IN THAT CASE, YOU WOULD THEN

21:45.771 --> 21:48.174
KNOW NOT AFTER SOMEONE GOT SICK,

21:48.174 --> 21:49.542
ESSENTIALLY, BUT YOU'D KNOW AS

21:49.542 --> 21:51.510
THE PIECE OF D.N.A. OR R.N.A.,

21:51.510 --> 21:52.745
OR AS THE VIRUS OR BACTERIA

21:52.745 --> 21:54.580
APPEARS IN A CITY, YOU COULD

21:54.580 --> 21:55.848
POTENTIALLY TRACK IT IN REAL

21:55.848 --> 21:57.583
TIME AND THEN RESPOND TO IT MUCH

21:57.583 --> 21:58.150
FASTER.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.485
SO, IT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT

21:59.485 --> 22:00.953
ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

22:00.953 --> 22:02.288
WHO LIVE IN THE CITIES AND

22:02.288 --> 22:03.322
BILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO RIDE THE

22:03.322 --> 22:04.890
SUBWAY OR TRANSIT... MASS

22:04.890 --> 22:05.791
TRANSIT EVERY YEAR.

22:05.791 --> 22:06.692
>> Stewart: DR. CHRISTOPHER

22:06.692 --> 22:07.860
MASON, THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR

22:07.860 --> 22:08.360
SCIENCE.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.461
>> THANKS, PLEASURE BEING HERE.

22:09.461 --> 22:10.162
>> Stewart: WE SHOOK HANDS, BY

22:10.162 --> 22:11.764
THE WAY.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.532
>> AND FIST BUMPS, YES.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.770
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.004
SATURDAY.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.475
>> Stewart: AND NOW TO "VIEWERS

22:23.475 --> 22:24.910
LIKE YOU," YOUR CHANCE TO

22:24.910 --> 22:26.312
COMMENT ON SOME OF OUR RECENT

22:26.312 --> 22:26.946
WORK.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.447
MANY OF YOU WROTE US ABOUT OUR

22:28.447 --> 22:29.848
INTERVIEW DESCRIBING A RECENT

22:29.848 --> 22:31.917
PEW POLL, A POLL THAT FOUND A

22:31.917 --> 22:33.419
LARGE GAP BETWEEN WHAT

22:33.419 --> 22:34.987
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE AND WHAT THE

22:34.987 --> 22:36.222
PUBLIC BELIEVES.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.890
ON THE ISSUE OF GENETICALLY

22:37.890 --> 22:39.792
MODIFIED FOODS, THE READER

22:39.792 --> 22:41.493
COMMENTED: "SCIENTISTS ARE SO

22:41.493 --> 22:43.295
BUSY CREATING 'BIGGER AND

22:43.295 --> 22:44.697
BETTER,' THEY FAIL TO CONSIDER

22:44.697 --> 22:45.831
THE PENALTIES OF THEIR

22:45.831 --> 22:46.765
CREATIONS.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.234
AFTER WATER, FRUITS AND

22:48.234 --> 22:49.668
VEGETABLES ARE THE STAFF OF

22:49.668 --> 22:50.970
LIFE, AND LIFE SHOULD, AT THE

22:50.970 --> 22:52.605
VERY LEAST, BE REAL."

22:52.605 --> 22:55.007
GARY GUTHRIE SAID: "WHAT'S SCARY

22:55.007 --> 22:56.775
IS THAT 12% OF SCIENTISTS

22:56.775 --> 22:58.510
APPARENTLY BELIEVE THAT G.M.O.s

22:58.510 --> 23:00.412
ARE NOT SAFE TO EAT.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.914
THAT IS THE GROUP TO LOOK TO FOR

23:01.914 --> 23:02.815
FACTS."

23:02.815 --> 23:04.750
AND FROM YAANG: "THE GENERAL

23:04.750 --> 23:06.252
PUBLIC MAY DISTRUST SCIENCE ON

23:06.252 --> 23:07.886
QUESTIONS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A

23:07.886 --> 23:09.121
HEALTHY DIET BECAUSE THEY WERE

23:09.121 --> 23:10.956
LED ASTRAY SO MANY TIMES.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.691
THINK OF HOW SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT

23:12.691 --> 23:14.059
HAS CHANGED ON DIETARY

23:14.059 --> 23:15.828
CHOLESTEROL, GOOD/BAD FATS,

23:15.828 --> 23:17.263
CARBS, EQUIVALENCE OF DIFFERENT

23:17.263 --> 23:19.431
SUGARS, FOOD PYRAMIDS, ETC.,

23:19.431 --> 23:20.499
ETC."

23:20.499 --> 23:22.935
LINDA BAETZEL SZULCZEWSKI ADDED:

23:22.935 --> 23:24.570
"I AGREE THAT G.M.O. IS PROBABLY

23:24.570 --> 23:25.504
OKAY.

23:25.504 --> 23:27.039
I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT

23:27.039 --> 23:29.008
TO KNOW WHATISA G.M.O."

23:29.008 --> 23:30.409
THERE WAS THIS FROM FREDRIC

23:30.409 --> 23:32.378
DENNIS WILLIAMS: "IN THE END,

23:32.378 --> 23:33.846
SURVEYS OF THE IGNORANCE OF THE

23:33.846 --> 23:35.881
POPULATION ONLY SERVE TO SHOW:

23:35.881 --> 23:37.249
ONE, PEOPLE LACK A DECENT

23:37.249 --> 23:38.717
EDUCATION AND THE ABILITY TO

23:38.717 --> 23:40.252
DISCERN FACT FROM FICTION;

23:40.252 --> 23:42.554
TWO, GOVERNMENT MISLEADS PEOPLE,

23:42.554 --> 23:44.023
USUALLY INTENTIONALLY AND FOR

23:44.023 --> 23:46.292
ITS OWN PURPOSES; AND, THREE,

23:46.292 --> 23:47.826
THE MEDIA LOOK FOR SENSATIONAL

23:47.826 --> 23:49.762
STORIES THAT INSPIRE FEAR.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.931
WELCOME TO DUMBOCRACY 2015."

23:52.931 --> 23:54.533
MARY BETHUNE JORDAN SAID: "I

23:54.533 --> 23:56.068
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO

23:56.068 --> 23:57.503
WHO IS BEHIND THE PEW RESEARCH

23:57.503 --> 23:58.203
CENTER.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.705
I DON'T BUY THIS POLL."

23:59.705 --> 24:01.073
AND FINALLY THIS, FROM ROLFE

24:01.073 --> 24:03.342
ERIC TIKKALA: "I'M WITH SCIENCE

24:03.342 --> 24:05.444
ON THIS, BUT, THEN AGAIN, I BET

24:05.444 --> 24:07.246
ON THE SEAHAWKS."

24:37.509 --> 24:38.911
ADNAN SYED, WHO HAS BEEN
