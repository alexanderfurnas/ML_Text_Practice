00:05.706 --> 00:06.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
growing GOP defections.

00:10.811 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sit down with Senator Susan
Collins, the
latest in a group of Republican
leaders refusing

00:16.717 --> 00:18.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to support a Donald Trump
presidency.

00:18.652 --> 00:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: Turkish
President Erdogan and Russian
President Putin

00:24.558 --> 00:30.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work to mend ties -- what
renewed relations
could mean for the two countries
and the U.S.

00:30.364 --> 00:35.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, what
happens when children
with autism reach adulthood?

00:35.135 --> 00:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the first of our two-part
series, we look
at a pilot program for a group
that's often

00:40.340 --> 00:42.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ignored.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER, Mother of Josh
Kluger: There
are so many ways that he has
changed and grown,

00:45.212 --> 00:47.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he's going to school, he's
learning classes.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's taking responsibilities for
his homework.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's taking responsibility for
his budgeting.

00:52.352 --> 00:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And spending a day
on the other
side of the classroom -- what a
high school

00:57.124 --> 01:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assistant principal learned
after shadowing
one of her students.

01:01.628 --> 01:08.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.735 --> 01:11.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.538 --> 01:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For Donald Trump,
more discord
in his own ranks, as he tries to
make up ground

01:21.882 --> 01:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the presidential race.

01:23.684 --> 01:28.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His economic speech of Monday
was swept from
the headlines by a high-profile
rejection

01:28.922 --> 01:31.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

01:31.224 --> 01:38.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican nominee faced new
defections
just a day after trying to reset
his campaign.

01:38.365 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Senator Susan Collins
of Maine
wrote in The Washington Post
that she will

01:43.236 --> 01:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not vote for Trump, explaining
she's been
-- quote -- "increasingly
dismayed by his

01:48.642 --> 01:51.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
constant stream of cruel
comments.

01:51.411 --> 01:57.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she added, "Treating others
with respect
is an idea that should transcend
politics."

01:58.018 --> 02:03.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump said nothing about Collins
this afternoon
in Wilmington, North Carolina.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he went after Democrat
Hillary Clinton
over gun rights.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary wants to abolish --
essentially abolish

02:11.131 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Second Amendment.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:13.834 --> 02:20.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: By the way, and if
she gets
to pick -- if she gets to pick
her judges,

02:20.140 --> 02:25.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing you can do, folks,
although the Second
Amendment people, maybe there
is.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

02:26.279 --> 02:29.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I will tell you what.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That will be a horrible day.

02:30.917 --> 02:35.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has said
she doesn't
favor abolishing the Second
Amendment.

02:35.622 --> 02:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Criticism of Trump came from 50
Republican
national security officials as
well.

02:41.294 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a letter yesterday, they
wrote: "We are
convinced that he would be a
dangerous president

02:46.333 --> 02:51.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and would put at risk our
country's national
security and well-being."

02:51.671 --> 02:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump dismissed their opposition
this morning
in an interview with FOX
Business, claiming

02:56.610 --> 02:59.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would have loved to have
been part of
his campaign.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: These were the
people that have
been there a long time,
Washington establishment

03:02.983 --> 03:05.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people that have been there a
long time.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at the terrible job they
have done.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hadn't planned on using any of
these people.

03:09.189 --> 03:13.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The candidate
also leveled
another harsh new charge at
Clinton in a tweet

03:13.960 --> 03:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Iran's execution of a
nuclear scientist.

03:17.798 --> 03:23.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said -- quote -- "Many people
are saying
that the Iranians killed the
scientist who

03:23.170 --> 03:28.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped the U.S. because of
Hillary Clinton's
hacked e-mails."

03:28.208 --> 03:33.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump cited no evidence for the
claim, and
a Clinton campaign spokesman
tweeted back:

03:33.980 --> 03:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Many people are saying equals I
made this
up."

03:38.151 --> 03:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton was hunting
for votes in
Florida, with a stop in Miami.

03:42.789 --> 03:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic nominee took on
Congress, too,
demanding that lawmakers return
to Washington

03:48.662 --> 03:51.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immediately to vote funding for
fighting the
Zika virus.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I am very disappointed that the
Congress went

03:55.836 --> 04:04.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on recess before actually
agreeing on what
they would do to put the
resources into this

04:04.244 --> 04:06.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

04:06.213 --> 04:10.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has now
formally agreed
to participate in the three
scheduled presidential

04:10.617 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

04:12.018 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has said he will too, but
may want to
renegotiate the terms.

04:17.157 --> 04:23.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this comes as more new polls
show Clinton
surging ahead, and opening up
big leads with

04:23.396 --> 04:30.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white college-educated women, a
demographic
that Republican Mitt Romney won
in 2012.

04:30.871 --> 04:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, critics accused Trump of
suggesting
that gun owners resort to
violence.

04:36.309 --> 04:41.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump campaign said he was
actually referring
to political power, urging them
to vote in

04:41.314 --> 04:43.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
record numbers.

04:43.216 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear directly from
Senator Susan Collins
about why she's rejected the
Trump candidacy

04:47.554 --> 04:49.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.

04:49.523 --> 04:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: A major
wildfire surged through
California's San Bernardino

04:54.795 --> 05:01.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mountains, threatening up to
5,000 homes;
900 firefighters are now
battling the blaze

05:01.034 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that sparked to life on Sunday.

05:03.403 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, it's only 6 percent
contained, and
officials have shut down area
schools.

05:08.808 --> 05:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another California fire, north
of Big Sur,
has engulfed more than 100
square miles.

05:13.513 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about 50 percent contained,
but still
growing.

05:16.349 --> 05:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Delta Air Lines
faced more
turmoil today, as it struggled
to recover

05:20.921 --> 05:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Monday's computer system
outage.

05:23.290 --> 05:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 500 flights were
canceled today,
on top of 1,000 yesterday.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hundreds more were delayed.

05:30.664 --> 05:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As passengers waited in airports
around the
world, Delta offered refunds and
$200 in travel

05:37.103 --> 05:38.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vouchers.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also waiving fees for
people switching
flights.

05:40.974 --> 05:46.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United Nations
appealed today
to all sides in Syria for a
humanitarian cease-fire

05:46.713 --> 05:48.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Aleppo.

05:48.615 --> 05:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's largest city has
seen heavy
fighting, with rebels breaking
through a government

05:52.586 --> 05:54.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
siege over the weekend.

05:54.454 --> 06:00.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, U.N. officials
argued, warned
there's a grave risk of disease,
unless Aleppo's

06:00.627 --> 06:02.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public utilities can be
repaired.

06:02.729 --> 06:08.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Attacks on civilian
infrastructure this
week have severely damaged the
city's electric

06:08.235 --> 06:12.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

leaving over two
million residents of Aleppo
without electricity

06:13.006 --> 06:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or access to the public water
network.

06:16.509 --> 06:21.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Water available through wells
and tanks is
not nearly enough to sustain the
needs of

06:21.481 --> 06:23.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the population.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.N. says that,
at a minimum,
it needs weekly pauses in the
fighting to

06:26.653 --> 06:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allow food and medicine to get
in.

06:28.622 --> 06:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Yemen, a
coalition led by
Saudi Arabia resumed airstrikes
on the capital

06:34.060 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the first time since April.

06:36.162 --> 06:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Sanaa, killing
14 workers on the overnight

06:41.901 --> 06:45.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came after U.N. peace talks
collapsed over

a freighter that sank during a
hurricane last
October.

06:52.946 --> 06:57.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The El Faro went down off the
Bahamas, en
route to Jacksonville -- from
Jacksonville

06:57.417 --> 06:58.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Puerto Rico.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

in a row.

07:26.279 --> 07:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

07:31.651 --> 07:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a Republican
senator explains why she won't
vote for Donald

07:40.026 --> 07:45.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump; Turkey and Russia meet
amid strained

as an adult with autism; and
much more.

07:53.673 --> 08:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for more on the Republican
defections
and discontent surrounding the
Trump candidacy,

08:03.983 --> 08:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we turn to Maine Senator Susan

08:08.088 --> 08:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not vote for Donald Trump, her
party's nominee.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke with me earlier today
from Bangor,
Maine.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senator Collins, welcome.

08:16.396 --> 08:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have declared Donald Trump
today in your
op-ed as unworthy to be your
party's nominee

08:21.901 --> 08:23.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for president.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why didn't you make that
conclusion sooner?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Donald Trump, once he won the
primary, would

08:31.978 --> 08:33.847 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

08:33.880 --> 08:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hoped that he would see a new
Donald Trump,
one who put forth thoughtful
policy positions,

08:40.854 --> 08:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stopped denigrating people, and
had a more
positive vision for America.

08:47.193 --> 08:54.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regrettably, I have concluded
that there is
not going to be a new Donald
Trump, that he's

08:54.167 --> 09:01.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incapable of saying he's sorry,
of changing,
of learning, of growing.

09:01.808 --> 09:06.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was that conclusion that
has led me
to believe that he lacks the
temperament,

09:06.946 --> 09:12.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the judgment, the knowledge, and
the self-restraint
to be our next president.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The questions about
his temperament
were raised again today when he
spoke in North

09:15.922 --> 09:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina and said that the only
way -- he
suggested that the only way to
stop Hillary

09:20.927 --> 09:25.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton from appointing judges
that they disagreed
with is that maybe the Second
Amendment folks

09:25.665 --> 09:27.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could handle it.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that suggest to you that he
was -- maybe
you didn't hear it because I
know you have

09:30.670 --> 09:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been traveling today, but does
that kind of
comment suggest to you a comment
on his temperament

09:35.341 --> 09:38.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or that he was joking or
suggesting violence
against his rival?

09:38.778 --> 09:40.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: I certainly don't
think he's
suggesting violence in any way.

09:45.018 --> 09:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, again, it's a very poor
choice of words.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think this speaks to a
broader issue.

09:53.993 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the politicization
of the judicial
nomination process, which both
parties have

10:00.700 --> 10:02.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been guilty of.

10:02.469 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Collins,
what does Donald
Trump's nomination as the
standard-bearer

10:06.873 --> 10:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for your party tell you about
your party?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:11.044 --> 10:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: I don't think
that Donald Trump
represents the traditional
Republican values

10:17.217 --> 10:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and heritage of my party.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's one reason that I don't
support him.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republican Party has always
revered the
individual.

10:27.694 --> 10:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We led the way in abolishing
slavery, for
example, and we recognize the
dignity and

10:34.834 --> 10:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worth of every human being.

10:37.804 --> 10:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is clear that Donald
Trump, by his
derogatory comments, by his
mocking of the

10:45.078 --> 10:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most vulnerable people in our
society, by
his marginalization of ethnic
and religious

10:52.452 --> 10:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minorities, doesn't reflect the
traditional
Republican values.

10:58.424 --> 11:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to see a Republican Party
that is a
big tent, inclusive party that
welcomes all

11:05.064 --> 11:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to be Republicans and to
contribute
their ideas and support our
position of providing

11:13.540 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity to the American
people.

11:17.043 --> 11:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe he goes in the
opposite direction
and deepens the divisions that
are so pervasive

11:24.784 --> 11:26.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in our society today.

11:26.586 --> 11:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you acknowledged
in your piece
today that ran in The Washington
Post that

11:31.124 --> 11:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is connecting with some
discontent in our
country and perhaps that Bernie
Sanders was

11:36.062 --> 11:37.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as well, you wrote.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So,

11:38.665 --> 11:39.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what is that?

11:39.799 --> 11:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And who can speak to that in
this election
year?

11:42.101 --> 11:43.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:43.903 --> 11:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: I see that
disconnect very
clearly in my own state of
Maine, where there

11:49.809 --> 11:54.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are people who have been
affected by mill
closures, some of which have
been brought

11:54.981 --> 12:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about by poorly negotiated trade
agreements,
and they do feel marginalized
and left behind.

12:02.822 --> 12:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have not been able to find
new work,
despite the fact that they did
nothing wrong

12:09.796 --> 12:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that caused them to lose their
jobs.

12:13.733 --> 12:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both parties need to do a better
job of reaching
out to those individuals, to
those hardworking

12:20.807 --> 12:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families, and providing job
training, matching
people and giving them new
skills for new

12:28.481 --> 12:30.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

12:30.283 --> 12:37.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is the one area where I
think Donald
Trump is striking a chord that
really resonates

12:37.090 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and should resonate.

12:39.659 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both parties need to do a better
job of rejecting
poorly negotiated trade
agreements.

12:46.366 --> 12:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would put the president's
TPP, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership agreement, in that
category.

12:56.075 --> 13:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have lost thousands of
manufacturing jobs
just in the state of Maine
alone, and that

13:04.017 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resonates with people, and
understandably
so.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Would you support
Hillary Clinton?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.423 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: I would not.

13:12.225 --> 13:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did work well with Hillary
when she was
my colleague in the Senate, and
I certainly

13:18.998 --> 13:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't bear her any ill will.

13:22.368 --> 13:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I listened carefully to
her commencement
speech, what I heard was a
laundry list of

13:29.676 --> 13:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very expensive new programs that
our country
simply cannot afford, and that
would add to

13:36.949 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our already overwhelming $17
trillion debt.

13:43.289 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm also disturbed by the
mismatch in her
answers to the questions about
her e-mail

13:53.399 --> 14:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
server and what the FBI Director
Comey says
that the FBI's investigation
found.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: You said
commencement speech,
but I'm pretty sure you meant
convention speech.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think that's right.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: I'm sorry.

14:07.847 --> 14:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Can I -- have you
ever met Donald
Trump?

14:08.681 --> 14:09.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: I have only met
him once.

14:11.784 --> 14:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was when he spoke to the
Republican Caucus.

14:15.655 --> 14:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that time, I suggested that
he present
a more positive agenda to the
American people.

14:22.795 --> 14:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I used the example of
supporting more
funding for biomedical research,
which has

14:30.103 --> 14:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a real priority among
Republicans in
both the House and the Senate.

14:35.308 --> 14:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And would you
suggest to any of
you colleagues that they join
you and oppose

14:40.113 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him, those who have endorsed him
already especially?

14:42.982 --> 14:44.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:44.550 --> 14:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Each of my
colleagues has to
make his or her own decision.

14:48.888 --> 14:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wouldn't presume to tell them
what decision
they should make.

14:53.459 --> 15:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been heartened by the
number of e-mails
that I have received and text
messages from

15:00.066 --> 15:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleagues in the Senate on both
sides of
the aisle applauding my op-ed
and supporting

15:06.939 --> 15:08.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what I have done.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, to be sure, there are those
who disagree
with me as well.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Susan Collins,
Republican of Maine,
thank you very much for your
time.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you.

15:20.119 --> 15:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we begin
an occasional
series about people living with
autism and

15:33.599 --> 15:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other spectrum disorders, A
Place in the World.

15:37.170 --> 15:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While reporting the history of
autism for
their book, "In a Different Key:
The Story

15:41.641 --> 15:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Autism," co-authors John
Donvan and Caren
Zucker found a program in
Phoenix, Arizona,

15:48.047 --> 15:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that expands options for people
living with
autism.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the first of two
reports.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN, Co-Author, "In a
Different Key:
The Story of Autism": Why is it
a big deal

15:57.023 --> 16:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Josh Kluger gets up every
morning and
makes his own breakfast and
straightens up

16:02.195 --> 16:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the place a little, and then
remembers, belatedly
to go back and grab his lunch
before he heads

16:08.868 --> 16:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off to work, which takes a
quarter-mile hike,
texting all the way, before he
reaches the

16:13.606 --> 16:17.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bus stop, and then a 45-minute
trip with one
transfer along the way?

16:17.944 --> 16:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I comes on board and
Josh shows me
how to swipe my ticket, why is
that a big

16:24.083 --> 16:25.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal?

16:25.384 --> 16:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, until last year, Josh
had experienced
none of this.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No apartment.

16:30.122 --> 16:31.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No paying job.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No bus pass even.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, he'd never ridden a
bus on his own
before last year.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How old are you now?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER, Program
Participant: I'm 36.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: You only really
began being able
to ride the bus when you were
already over

16:41.534 --> 16:42.501 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
30?

16:42.535 --> 16:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSH KLUGER: I think so, yes.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: What did you have
to learn?

16:46.606 --> 16:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH KLUGER: I know learned how
-- streets.

16:50.810 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And though Josh is
not the chattiest
person around, except perhaps
when he's texting,

16:56.849 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can tell from his stride and
from his
air of confidence about where
he's heading

17:01.287 --> 17:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Josh really likes the life
he has right
now.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is this ours?

17:04.857 --> 17:05.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: Yes.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN DONVAN: OK.

17:07.293 --> 17:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And that he's going
to keep going
with it, autism or not.

17:11.597 --> 17:19.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: With autism, it's
usually been
the kids whose faces we see when
the topic

17:19.739 --> 17:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is discussed, children like
these.

17:22.041 --> 17:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We root for their success in
school and on
the playground, and we have come
to recognize

17:26.412 --> 17:31.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that even a little boy like this
one, who
may look disconnected, and whose
autism keeps

17:31.284 --> 17:37.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him from speaking many words,
nevertheless
can sing and therefore also has
something

17:37.490 --> 17:40.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

17:40.493 --> 17:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOY (singing): Never give up on
wishes.

17:48.367 --> 17:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But the kids grow
up inevitably,
so that the boys whose photo you
just saw,

17:53.839 --> 17:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have become these men.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We gathered them together to
make a point.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This one is now 19-year-old
Dylan.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this little boy called
Stuart, he is now
22.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Josh, you have met.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is 36.

18:06.385 --> 18:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This kid, he is 21 now and named
Ian.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Craig, he's a 26-year-old now.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Jake, he grew into a man
also.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
He's 22.

18:18.497 --> 18:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the point is, adults don't
get nearly
the attention and support the
kids do, maybe

18:23.436 --> 18:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they're not as cute or
because people
forget that autism is lifelong.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it is.

18:30.543 --> 18:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that fact is the driving
idea behind a
new pilot program called First
Place Transition

18:36.015 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Academy, located in Phoenix,
Arizona, in which
these same young men are today
the pioneers.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Are you going to mix it?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where would you find that?

18:44.857 --> 18:47.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: In the store.

18:47.226 --> 18:51.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: In the store?

18:51.297 --> 18:56.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: There are nine of
them in all,
paired off together in a cluster
of apartments

18:56.969 --> 19:01.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in a complex where their
neighbors are mostly
retirees who have no autism
connection.

19:01.574 --> 19:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They eat together and learn
together, two
years of specialized training
designed to

19:06.545 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improve their odds of having,
let's call it,
a successful adulthood, which
means what?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
IAN MCCOY, Student: What
doughnuts would you
like for that one?

19:14.587 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, take Ian, who
is now holding
down a paying job arranged for
by the program,

19:19.925 --> 19:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
showing that he can be good at
customer service.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: I got the lemonade
and morning
buzz.

19:24.463 --> 19:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Social interactions
can be enormously
challenging for people on the
spectrum.

19:28.768 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's part of the reason that
unemployment
among autistic adults hovers
near 80 percent.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IAN MCCOY: Hello.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How's it going?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Pretty good, I guess.

19:36.242 --> 19:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Not long ago, that
included Ian,
who is an unfailing optimist.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Before you came here, where were
you?

19:41.347 --> 19:42.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Were you in high school?

19:42.681 --> 19:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: I was in my parents'
house for
at least two years.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I enrolled.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here I am now a year later.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am satisfied with my future.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: What is your
future?

19:52.992 --> 19:53.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you know?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: It's hard to predict
right now.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Sure.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: It's a brief idea.

19:59.498 --> 20:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to live in an
apartment, pay
my own rent, have my own car and
have a career,

20:03.369 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in other words, because I'm --
the part-time
job is kind of tedious, but it's
my main focus

20:07.973 --> 20:09.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for now.

20:09.408 --> 20:12.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, that's all
about learning
how to do jobs, right?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: Absolutely, yes.

20:14.447 --> 20:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: The other men go to
other workplaces,
a garden that raises produce for
sales to

20:20.219 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
restaurants.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Awesome.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: An animal shelter
which happens
to be a volunteer job, but that
doesn't matter.

20:25.357 --> 20:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Knowing how to be professionally
responsible
and productive does, like being
on time for

20:29.895 --> 20:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work, dressing correctly for the
situation,
completing tasks assigned
reliably.

20:35.401 --> 20:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are learned skills that do
not necessarily
come easily to all members of
the group because

20:40.840 --> 20:42.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their autism.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD HERRON-VALENZUELA, Gateway
Community
College: So, on the worksheet,
guys, you are

20:44.643 --> 20:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting a check mark for the
items that you're
going to need to purchase in
your first apartment.

20:49.615 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And support staff
literally imparts
lessons on the logistics of
adult life, like

20:55.087 --> 21:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this session held in a lecture
hall made available
by Gateway Community College.

21:02.128 --> 21:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a class on how to navigate
the options
available in public transport,
how to get

21:06.832 --> 21:09.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from here to there, with
quizzes.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Exact fare required.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Exact fare required.

21:12.972 --> 21:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: When it comes to
successful adulthood,
it's this sort of
mundane-seeming know-how

21:18.544 --> 21:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that can in fact be crucial.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important is that to their
success in
this program?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRAD HERRON-VALENZUELA: Yes,
it's critical.

21:24.850 --> 21:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's one of the skills that
we target
really early on.

21:28.821 --> 21:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, again, this is the thing
that's going
to allow them to access
employment.

21:32.558 --> 21:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to allow them to
access different
social activities, different
quality of life

21:37.963 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

21:39.098 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: So getting around
is key to independence?

21:39.965 --> 21:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRAD HERRON-VALENZUELA:
Absolutely.

21:40.966 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's critical.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Which brings us
back to Josh.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That 45-minute commute of his
landed us here.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is your place of work,
huh?

21:48.908 --> 21:49.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: Yes.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Wow.

21:51.177 --> 21:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Josh works for the Arizona
Diamondbacks baseball
team.

21:53.879 --> 21:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and another member of the
group named Jake,
they have been cycling through a
variety of

21:58.350 --> 22:02.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs here, some in the office
upstairs, and
now they're getting their hands
dirty with

22:02.755 --> 22:04.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
grounds maintenance.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Josh, you're not a big baseball
fan.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: I'm not.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But you're a work
fan.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It sounds like you really love
this job.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: In a way.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: In a way.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:17.436 --> 22:19.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN DONVAN: OK.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he loves being a working
man, even though
his boss here, Marian Rhodes,
says it has

22:21.740 --> 22:23.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not always been smooth.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES, Executive,
Arizona Diamondbacks:
He had a thing with his badge,
that he was

22:25.711 --> 22:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
losing his badge constantly.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said, where's your badge?

22:28.247 --> 22:29.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's like, I left it here,
whatever.

22:29.949 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said -- I had to explain
to him, your
badge is like the key to your
home.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the key to our ballpark.

22:35.120 --> 22:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you lose it, someone has
the key to
access our building at any time.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, so what's the answer
here?

22:41.894 --> 22:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We now have him drop the badge
off in the
morning and pick the badge up.

22:45.798 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he hasn't -- now he is
always clocked
in and clocked out.

22:49.401 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But that's what
learning is about.

22:52.104 --> 22:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you willing to let these
guys make mistakes
more than you would other
people?

22:56.475 --> 22:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES: Definitely.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Yes?

22:58.477 --> 22:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES: Definitely.

22:59.478 --> 23:00.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Why is that
important?

23:00.746 --> 23:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES: Because you have
to meet them
where they are.

23:02.548 --> 23:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Josh's mom has been
astounded
by the change she's seen in the
past 12 months.

23:07.586 --> 23:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER, Mother of Josh
Kluger: There
are so many ways that he has
changed and grown,

23:11.690 --> 23:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he's going to school, he's
learning classes.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's taking responsibilities for
his homework.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's taking responsibility for
his budgeting.

23:18.664 --> 23:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: This is all new?

23:19.932 --> 23:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: This is all new.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: This is something
he learned
as a middle-aged man?

23:23.335 --> 23:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: As a middle-aged
man.

23:24.503 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Wow.

23:25.504 --> 23:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: The growth has
been amazing.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really been amazing.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: If Josh were not
here, where
would he be in life?

23:32.878 --> 23:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: At our house,
doing probably
the same thing, and not being
very happy.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know what his future
would have
been.

23:43.455 --> 23:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And back at the
apartment complex,
you can see how these guys, some
of whom had

23:48.160 --> 23:53.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no friends to speak of before in
their lives,
are learning to help each other
out.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are, in short, a community.

23:56.068 --> 24:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while this pilot project has
enrolled
only men, who today make up
roughly 80 percent

24:00.739 --> 24:06.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people recognized as
autistic, the full
program will grow to include
women as well.

24:06.645 --> 24:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now something needs to be
said as that
group shot we started with, and
in particular

24:10.916 --> 24:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the man on the lower
right.

24:13.118 --> 24:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was once that singing boy,
and, in fact,
he doesn't live with the other
men.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He can't, because his autism
affects him differently
from the others.

24:22.494 --> 24:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a place being built
in Phoenix
that will also have room for
him.

24:27.566 --> 24:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That story in part two tomorrow.

24:37.009 --> 24:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

24:46.051 --> 24:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what an assistant
principal learned from spending
the day with

24:51.223 --> 24:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a student; the man with amnesia
who taught
us about memory; and creating
art with a lawn

24:57.129 --> 24:58.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mower.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first: It's
been three
weeks since a failed coup
attempt rocked the

25:02.835 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nation of Turkey.

25:05.104 --> 25:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, thousands have been
arrested in
a crackdown on suspected
plotters, including

25:09.074 --> 25:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military officers, educators and
journalists.

25:12.211 --> 25:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, there was no mistaking
the message
from Turkey's leader has
changed, by his choice

25:17.816 --> 25:19.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of where to travel.

25:19.685 --> 25:26.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A telling moment in St.
Petersburg: Russia's
President Vladimir Putin
welcomed Turkey's

25:26.425 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,

25:28.293 --> 25:31.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): The relations
between Russia

25:31.563 --> 25:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Turkey entered into a really
positive
stage.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am sure that steps we both
take will widen
our cooperation.

25:37.669 --> 25:40.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): Your visit today
means that we

25:41.006 --> 25:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all want at renewal of our
dialogue and restoration
of our relations in the
interests of Russian

25:46.645 --> 25:48.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Turkish peoples.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's their first
meeting since
those relations were sent into a
tailspin

25:52.284 --> 25:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last November, when Turkey shot
down a Russian
warplane near the Syrian border.

25:58.323 --> 26:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan has since apologized,
and, today,
the two pledged to restart
commercial deals.

26:04.430 --> 26:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will also discuss their
differences over
Syria.

26:08.233 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan wants President Bashar
al-Assad ousted,
but Russian airpower has helped
keep him in

26:15.541 --> 26:17.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

26:17.309 --> 26:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The visit also comes as the July
coup attempt
has triggered tensions between
Turkey and

26:23.415 --> 26:25.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the West.

26:25.117 --> 26:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN (through
translator):
Does the West support terrorism
or not?

26:30.122 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does the West side with
democracy or the coup
or terrorism?

26:33.158 --> 26:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Erdogan accuses a
former ally,
cleric Fethullah Gulen, of
fomenting the coup.

26:39.898 --> 26:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lives in Pennsylvania, and
Turkey wants
the U.S. to extradite him
immediately.

26:45.404 --> 26:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Turkish justice
minister said the
U.S. is risking relations with a
NATO ally

26:51.977 --> 26:54.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by not handing Gulen over.

26:54.379 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration says
the normal extradition
process must play out.

26:59.318 --> 27:05.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH TRUDEAU, State
Department Spokesperson:
We expect all parties, media,
civil society,

27:05.157 --> 27:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Turkish government, to be
responsible.

27:07.526 --> 27:12.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
millions turned
out in Istanbul on Sunday in a
mass show of

27:12.431 --> 27:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
support for Erdogan.

27:14.666 --> 27:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the while, purges continue
throughout
the Turkish military and public
sector.

27:19.838 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To date, more than 16,000 people
have been
arrested over the coup attempt.

27:24.776 --> 27:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands more, including judges
and educators,
have been sacked.

27:29.448 --> 27:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Journalists have been detained
and scores
of news organizations shut down.

27:34.353 --> 27:41.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now for more on this,
Kemal Kirisci,
a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.

27:41.326 --> 27:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Henri Barkey, he's director
of the Middle
East program at the Woodrow
Wilson International

27:46.131 --> 27:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Center for Scholars.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

27:49.635 --> 27:51.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Henri Barkey, to you first.

27:51.036 --> 27:54.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You were in Turkey for a
conference the weekend
the coup took place.

27:54.673 --> 27:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been accused by the
Turkish media
of having played a role in
fomenting the coup.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there any truth to that?

28:01.547 --> 28:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY, Woodrow Wilson
International
Center for Scholars: Of course
not.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it's complete, complete
imagination.

28:03.916 --> 28:08.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They just want to accuse
America, and they're
using us as a scapegoat.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so they just
made it up?

28:10.856 --> 28:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: Oh, they made up
-- the stories
that they made up are so
incredible, that

28:15.160 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not worth repeating on
the air, but
they involve fanciful American
criminals who

28:21.300 --> 28:27.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came from California to help us
do things,
to -- complete, complete
fiction.

28:27.839 --> 28:35.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were on an island 45 minutes
away from
all the events and doing our
job, which was

28:35.380 --> 28:36.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a conference.

28:36.848 --> 28:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kemal Kirisci,
who do you believe
was behind the coup?

28:39.718 --> 28:44.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEMAL KIRISCI, Brookings
Institution: I very
much empathize and agree with my
colleague

28:45.023 --> 28:50.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Henri Barkey, but I think one
also has to
understand that this nation is
going through

28:50.562 --> 28:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a major shock, a major trauma.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was a coup attempt.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a bloody coup attempt.

28:58.537 --> 29:03.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Turkey has had previous
experiences with coups.

29:03.408 --> 29:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But none of them have been
directed towards
the public in the manner in
which this has

29:09.848 --> 29:11.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taken place.

29:11.316 --> 29:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of the previous coups
attacked actually
the Turkish Parliament.

29:17.656 --> 29:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people on their own
steam at first,
and then galvanized the
president of Turkey,

29:24.029 --> 29:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stood up against this coup, and
feel that
they have succeeded in
protecting their democracy,

29:32.671 --> 29:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as much as this democracy may
have its problems.

29:37.075 --> 29:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the country is also -- has a
longstanding
tradition of, unfortunately,
anti-Americanism,

29:45.450 --> 29:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anti-Westernism and skepticism
towards the
West.

29:49.021 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a number of issues have
aligned one after
the other that is fueling this
perspective

29:58.130 --> 29:59.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the West.

29:59.798 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
stop you
there, because I want to get to
this point

30:04.069 --> 30:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Turkish government has --
they have repeatedly
said and suggested that the
United States

30:09.174 --> 30:10.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was behind the coup.

30:10.909 --> 30:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Henri Barkey, is there any
evidence that ties
the United States to what
happened?

30:15.047 --> 30:16.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: Look, there is
absolutely no
evidence.

30:16.581 --> 30:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no reason for the
United States to
execute a coup.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not in the interests the
United States.

30:21.586 --> 30:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey and the United States
have been working.

30:24.222 --> 30:28.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Although they have
disagreements, they were
working very closely on Syria
with the two

30:28.794 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

30:30.529 --> 30:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was an agreement between
President Obama
and President Erdogan as to what
to do in

30:34.599 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

30:36.234 --> 30:38.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The days of coups over.

30:38.036 --> 30:41.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No administration in the United
States in
the 21st century is going the
sanction a coup

30:41.773 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Turkey.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this fallacy in Turkey that
everything
is done by the United States,
it's an easy

30:46.578 --> 30:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way of blaming others for
domestic issues.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kemal Kirisci,
how do you explain
this?

30:52.884 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the Turkish government
has said the
U.S. is involved.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you believe about that?

30:58.290 --> 31:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: You know, there's
very many
conflicting views that are
coming out.

31:05.097 --> 31:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, there is what
you have just
said, what Henri has said.

31:09.167 --> 31:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then the spokesman of the
president, Ibrahim
Kalin, keeps saying that that's
not the position

31:15.941 --> 31:19.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Turkish government and
presidency.

31:19.344 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, on the other hand, I have
watched hours
and hours of TV debate, and, in
those debates,

31:28.720 --> 31:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunately, people of high
military ranks,
including a former chief of
staff, is convinced

31:36.228 --> 31:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is an American finger
somewhere
along the way, directly or
indirectly.

31:42.567 --> 31:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henri Barkey,
what are the
consequences of that if this
continues in

31:47.038 --> 31:48.073 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey?

31:48.106 --> 31:49.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HENRI BARKEY: Well, the
consequences are serious.

31:49.941 --> 31:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the moment, the American
government is
trying to keep low and not to
make too much

31:54.279 --> 31:56.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a fuss.

31:56.081 --> 32:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, unfortunately, the longer
this lasts,
the more the Turkish officials
directly or

32:00.352 --> 32:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indirectly attack the United
States, the more
the American -- Turkish public
is going to

32:04.089 --> 32:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become more anti-American.

32:06.124 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have already seen the
consequences.

32:08.293 --> 32:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fulbright has canceled now for
next year its
-- its...

32:11.396 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scholar exchange.

32:13.131 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: ... scholars going
forward,
because people are afraid that
the Americans

32:18.370 --> 32:19.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will be at risk.

32:19.671 --> 32:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, therefore, it's more than
just Americans
being at risk.

32:24.843 --> 32:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the fact that it would be
very difficult
for Turkish officials and
American officials,

32:29.781 --> 32:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially at the military
level, to work
together in a harmonious way as
they did before.

32:34.753 --> 32:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Kemal
Kirisci, we're
hearing that officials in the
Erdogan government

32:39.324 --> 32:40.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are saying this.

32:40.325 --> 32:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What about President Erdogan
himself?

32:41.526 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think he believes that
the U.S. was
involved?

32:44.596 --> 32:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: If you listen to
his rhetoric,
I think you would say yes.

32:50.669 --> 32:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, it's very difficult to
go into his
mind.

32:54.773 --> 32:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He can also be very pragmatic
when he chooses
to be.

32:59.845 --> 33:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the point here is that
there was a
coup attempt and there are
allegations, for

33:07.219 --> 33:14.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some, quite convincing
allegations, that individuals
belonging to the Gulenist
movement were involved

33:14.359 --> 33:16.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in it.

33:16.161 --> 33:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a consequence, an ally of the
United States,
a member of NATO's military is
in a mess.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The country is in a state of
turmoil.

33:25.837 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from my perspective, I think
these allegations
need to be taken seriously, and
maybe some

33:32.477 --> 33:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperation put into place to
investigate
whether they are true or not,
independently

33:39.684 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the extradition issue that
was made reference
to.

33:43.154 --> 33:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean --
you're talking
about extraditing the cleric,
the Turkish

33:46.224 --> 33:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cleric who is in Pennsylvania.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEMAL KIRISCI: Yes.

33:49.461 --> 33:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. has said
they don't
have the evidence to proceed
with an extradition.

33:53.832 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just to be clear, what are
you saying
by an investigation?

33:57.602 --> 33:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you saying needs to be
done here?

33:59.638 --> 34:08.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: For the average
Turkish mind,
it's very difficult not -- not
to think that

34:08.213 --> 34:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States wouldn't have
some access
to intelligence information,
when, for example,,

34:15.253 --> 34:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the commander of the Incirlik
base group,
with whom the United States
shares the base,

34:22.560 --> 34:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was amongst the instigators of
the coup and
even attempted to seek asylum
with U.S. military

34:30.435 --> 34:32.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
authorities there.

34:32.570 --> 34:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, put yourself in the shoes of
an average
Turkish person, and maybe
officials as well,

34:40.345 --> 34:46.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and look at the United States,
look at its
resources, look at its
intelligence networks.

34:46.685 --> 34:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It becomes very difficult to
convince them
that somehow the United States
was oblivious

34:53.425 --> 34:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to what was coming up there.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

34:56.394 --> 34:58.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:58.096 --> 34:59.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: ... prepared
personally to
go along with it, but that's the
state of

34:59.731 --> 35:01.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind.

35:01.499 --> 35:06.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm suggesting that the
United States
has a stake, the government has
a stake to

35:06.504 --> 35:12.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperate with their counterpart
and look
into whatever intelligence and
information

35:12.143 --> 35:16.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be available through the
networks that
the U.S. has access.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henri Barkey, is
there a way
to do that?

35:18.750 --> 35:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do you see this going?

35:20.518 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: I actually think
the only way
this is going to end is if
there's a very

35:24.422 --> 35:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forceful response from the
United States that
asks President Erdogan needs to
squash these

35:31.162 --> 35:32.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stories.

35:32.597 --> 35:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only person in Turkey who
can squash these
stories is Mr. Erdogan.

35:35.667 --> 35:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he gets up and says, "I don't
believe the
United States was involved, we
have no evidence

35:40.438 --> 35:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that effect," that will put
most of the
rumors aside.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for that, I think President
Obama has
to get involved.

35:48.213 --> 35:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not going to happen because
some State
Department spokesperson said...

35:51.516 --> 35:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, President
Obama has said
this absolutely, unequivocally
didn't happen,

35:55.954 --> 35:57.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there was no U.S.
involvement.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what more are you saying
President Obama...

35:59.424 --> 36:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: He said this in a
press interview
with President Nieto of Mexico.

36:07.332 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to address directly the
Turkish press,
maybe invite the Turkish press
to the White

36:12.737 --> 36:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House, and challenge also
President Erdogan.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He can't let this go on like
this.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There won't be an investigation.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There cannot be an
investigation.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying the
administration
hasn't taken it seriously
enough?

36:23.915 --> 36:24.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HENRI BARKEY: Right.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, they have taken it
seriously, but they're
choosing to keep quiet.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that keeps the rumors going.

36:31.456 --> 36:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henri Barkey,
Kemal Kirisci,
thanks to both of you.

36:38.863 --> 36:48.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: Thank you.

36:48.306 --> 36:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: High school students
and parents
sometimes say principals and
teachers don't

36:56.548 --> 36:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quite understand what it's like
to be a student
these days.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It turns out there's an effort
to change that.

37:02.287 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 1,300 principals recently
took a day
off from their usual role and
instead followed

37:07.926 --> 37:09.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one of their students for a day.

37:09.894 --> 37:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The approach came from two
groups outside
the traditional field of public
education,

37:14.566 --> 37:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Design School at Stanford
University,
and IDEO, a design company based
in Palo Alto,

37:22.674 --> 37:24.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

37:24.609 --> 37:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week followed one principal
through the first

37:27.812 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever national Shadow a Student
Day Challenge.

37:31.716 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
education series on
Making the Grade.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAREN RITTER, Assistant
Principal, East Leyden
High School: My name is Karen
Ritter.

37:38.022 --> 37:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm an assistant principal at
East Leyden
High School, which is just
outside of Chicago.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, today, I will be shadowing
a student.

37:46.631 --> 37:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Why are you doing
this?

37:50.935 --> 37:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: Just to get a
sense of what
students go through during the
day.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't really get to spend a
lot of time
with students.

38:02.147 --> 38:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Usually, I'm in charge of things
that the
teachers are involved in.

38:06.718 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this includes teacher
evaluations, teacher
attendance, professional
development.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would say 50 percent is in
meetings.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Do you feel like
you know what
goes on here?

38:18.863 --> 38:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
growing GOP defections. We sit
down with Senator

38:23.601 --> 38:23.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Collins, the latest in a
group of Republican
leaders refusing to support a
Donald Trump

38:24.002 --> 38:25.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: Turkish
President Erdogan and Russian
President Putin

38:27.672 --> 38:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work to mend ties -- what
renewed relations
could mean for the two countries
and the U.S.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, what
happens when children
with autism reach adulthood? In
the first

38:31.209 --> 38:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our two-part series, we look
at a pilot
program for a group that's often
ignored.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER, Mother of Josh
Kluger: There
are so many ways that he has
changed and grown,

38:35.046 --> 38:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's going to school, he's
learning classes.
He's taking responsibilities for
his homework.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's taking responsibility for
his budgeting.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And spending a day
on the other
side of the classroom -- what a
high school

38:39.217 --> 38:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assistant principal learned
after shadowing
one of her students.

38:40.218 --> 38:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

38:40.518 --> 38:42.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

38:42.353 --> 38:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For Donald Trump,
more discord
in his own ranks, as he tries to
make up ground

38:44.155 --> 38:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the presidential race. His
economic speech
of Monday was swept from the
headlines by

38:44.856 --> 38:46.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a high-profile rejection today.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican nominee faced new
defections
just a day after trying to reset
his campaign.

38:48.359 --> 38:50.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Senator Susan Collins
of Maine
wrote in The Washington Post
that she will

38:50.094 --> 38:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not vote for Trump, explaining
she's been
-- quote -- "increasingly
dismayed by his

38:50.895 --> 38:52.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
constant stream of cruel
comments.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she added, "Treating others
with respect
is an idea that should transcend
politics."

38:54.499 --> 38:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump said nothing about Collins
this afternoon
in Wilmington, North Carolina.
Instead, he

38:55.633 --> 38:57.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went after Democrat Hillary
Clinton over gun
rights.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary wants to abolish --
essentially abolish

38:58.069 --> 38:58.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Second Amendment.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

39:00.071 --> 39:01.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: By the way, and if
she gets
to pick -- if she gets to pick
her judges,

39:01.940 --> 39:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing you can do, folks,
although the Second
Amendment people, maybe there
is. I don't

39:02.240 --> 39:03.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will tell you what. That
will be a horrible
day.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has said
she doesn't
favor abolishing the Second
Amendment.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Criticism of Trump came from 50
Republican
national security officials as
well. In a

39:08.880 --> 39:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
letter yesterday, they wrote:
"We are convinced
that he would be a dangerous
president and

39:10.248 --> 39:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would put at risk our country's
national security
and well-being."

39:12.016 --> 39:13.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump dismissed their opposition
this morning
in an interview with FOX
Business, claiming

39:13.284 --> 39:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would have loved to have
been part of
his campaign.

39:15.119 --> 39:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: These were the
people that have
been there a long time,
Washington establishment

39:16.988 --> 39:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that have been there a
long time. Look
at the terrible job they have
done. I hadn't

39:17.855 --> 39:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planned on using any of these
people.

39:19.691 --> 39:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The candidate
also leveled
another harsh new charge at
Clinton in a tweet

39:20.725 --> 39:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about Iran's execution of a
nuclear scientist.

39:22.493 --> 39:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said -- quote -- "Many people
are saying
that the Iranians killed the
scientist who

39:23.795 --> 39:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped the U.S. because of
Hillary Clinton's
hacked e-mails."

39:25.563 --> 39:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump cited no evidence for the
claim, and
a Clinton campaign spokesman
tweeted back:

39:26.631 --> 39:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Many people are saying equals I
made this
up."

39:28.466 --> 39:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton was hunting
for votes in
Florida, with a stop in Miami.
The Democratic

39:30.301 --> 39:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee took on Congress, too,
demanding that
lawmakers return to Washington
immediately

39:31.269 --> 39:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to vote funding for fighting the
Zika virus.

39:33.238 --> 39:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I am very disappointed that the
Congress went

39:35.006 --> 39:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on recess before actually
agreeing on what
they would do to put the
resources into this

39:35.306 --> 39:37.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton has now
formally agreed
to participate in the three
scheduled presidential

39:38.810 --> 39:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debates. Trump has said he will
too, but may
want to renegotiate the terms.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this comes as more new polls
show Clinton
surging ahead, and opening up
big leads with

39:42.347 --> 39:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white college-educated women, a
demographic
that Republican Mitt Romney won
in 2012.

39:44.182 --> 39:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, critics accused Trump of
suggesting
that gun owners resort to
violence. The Trump

39:46.017 --> 39:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign said he was actually
referring to
political power, urging them to
vote in record

39:46.317 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
numbers.

39:48.219 --> 39:48.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear directly from
Senator Susan Collins
about why she's rejected the
Trump candidacy

39:48.920 --> 39:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: A major
wildfire surged through
California's San Bernardino

39:52.624 --> 39:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mountains, threatening up to
5,000 homes;
900 firefighters are now
battling the blaze

39:54.459 --> 39:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sparked to life on Sunday.
So far, it's
only 6 percent contained, and
officials have

39:55.026 --> 39:56.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shut down area schools.

39:56.861 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another California fire, north
of Big Sur,
has engulfed more than 100
square miles. It's

39:57.862 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 50 percent contained, but
still growing.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Delta Air Lines
faced more
turmoil today, as it struggled
to recover

40:01.432 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Monday's computer system
outage. More
than 500 flights were canceled
today, on top

40:02.467 --> 40:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of 1,000 yesterday. Hundreds
more were delayed.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As passengers waited in airports
around the
world, Delta offered refunds and
$200 in travel

40:05.570 --> 40:07.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vouchers. It's also waiving fees
for people
switching flights.

40:07.538 --> 40:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United Nations
appealed today
to all sides in Syria for a
humanitarian cease-fire

40:09.140 --> 40:10.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Aleppo. The country's largest
city has
seen heavy fighting, with rebels
breaking

40:10.108 --> 40:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through a government siege over
the weekend.

40:11.976 --> 40:12.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, U.N. officials
argued, warned
there's a grave risk of disease,
unless Aleppo's

40:12.777 --> 40:14.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public utilities can be
repaired.

40:14.612 --> 40:16.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Attacks on civilian
infrastructure this
week have severely damaged the
city's electric

40:16.481 --> 40:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and water infrastructure,
leaving over two
million residents of Aleppo
without electricity

40:18.416 --> 40:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or access to the public water
network. Water
available through wells and
tanks is not nearly

40:19.417 --> 40:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough to sustain the needs of
the population.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.N. says that,
at a minimum,
it needs weekly pauses in the
fighting to

40:22.086 --> 40:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allow food and medicine to get
in.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Yemen, a
coalition led by
Saudi Arabia resumed airstrikes
on the capital

40:25.723 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the first time since April.
One strike
hit a food factory in Sanaa,
killing 14 workers

40:27.392 --> 40:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the overnight shift. It came
after U.N.
peace talks collapsed over the
weekend.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, search crews
have recovered the black box
recorder from

40:31.095 --> 40:32.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a freighter that sank during a
hurricane last
October. The El Faro went down
off the Bahamas,

40:32.897 --> 40:34.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
en route to Jacksonville -- from
Jacksonville
to Puerto Rico. All 33 crew
members died.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recorder is being brought
back to Virginia
Beach, Virginia, for
examination.

40:36.401 --> 40:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street
today, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
three points

40:38.069 --> 40:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to close at 18533. The Nasdaq
rose 12 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added a
fraction.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And a late result
from the Summer
Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The
U.S. women

40:41.939 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won the gold medal this evening
in team gymnastics,
for the second Olympics in a
row. Led by powerhouse

40:43.841 --> 40:44.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simone Biles, the Americans
posted top scores
in all four events. Competition
in individual

40:44.542 --> 40:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
events comes later this week.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a Republican
senator explains why she won't
vote for Donald

40:48.112 --> 40:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump; Turkey and Russia meet
amid strained
relations with the U.S.;
learning to live

40:49.013 --> 40:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as an adult with autism; and
much more.

40:50.815 --> 40:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for more on the Republican
defections
and discontent surrounding the
Trump candidacy,

40:52.684 --> 40:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we turn to Maine Senator Susan
Collins, who,
as we noted earlier, announced
today she will

40:53.685 --> 40:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not vote for Donald Trump, her
party's nominee.

40:54.819 --> 40:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke with me earlier today
from Bangor,
Maine.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senator Collins, welcome.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have declared Donald Trump
today in your
op-ed as unworthy to be your
party's nominee

40:58.556 --> 41:00.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for president. Why didn't you
make that conclusion
sooner?

41:00.358 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: I
kept hoping
that Donald Trump, once he won
the primary,

41:02.193 --> 41:04.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would change. I hoped that he
would see a
new Donald Trump, one who put
forth thoughtful

41:04.062 --> 41:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy positions, stopped
denigrating people,
and had a more positive vision
for America.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regrettably, I have concluded
that there is
not going to be a new Donald
Trump, that he's

41:07.365 --> 41:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incapable of saying he's sorry,
of changing,
of learning, of growing.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was that conclusion that
has led me
to believe that he lacks the
temperament,

41:10.668 --> 41:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the judgment, the knowledge, and
the self-restraint
to be our next president.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The questions about
his temperament
were raised again today when he
spoke in North

41:14.305 --> 41:16.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina and said that the only
way -- he
suggested that the only way to
stop Hillary

41:16.274 --> 41:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton from appointing judges
that they disagreed
with is that maybe the Second
Amendment folks

41:16.708 --> 41:18.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could handle it.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that suggest to you that he
was -- maybe
you didn't hear it because I
know you have

41:20.411 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been traveling today, but does
that kind of
comment suggest to you a comment
on his temperament

41:21.746 --> 41:23.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or that he was joking or
suggesting violence
against his rival?

41:23.414 --> 41:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I certainly
don't think
he's suggesting violence in any
way.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, it's a very poor
choice of words.
And I think this speaks to a
broader issue.

41:27.051 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the politicization
of the judicial
nomination process, which both
parties have

41:27.485 --> 41:29.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been guilty of.

41:29.253 --> 41:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Collins,
what does Donald
Trump's nomination as the
standard-bearer

41:30.221 --> 41:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for your party tell you about
your party?

41:32.056 --> 41:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I don't
think that Donald
Trump represents the traditional
Republican

41:32.757 --> 41:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
values and heritage of my party.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's one reason that I don't
support him.
The Republican Party has always
revered the

41:36.494 --> 41:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual. We led the way in
abolishing slavery,
for example, and we recognize
the dignity

41:37.195 --> 41:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and worth of every human being.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is clear that Donald
Trump, by his
derogatory comments, by his
mocking of the

41:40.832 --> 41:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most vulnerable people in our
society, by
his marginalization of ethnic
and religious

41:42.166 --> 41:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minorities, doesn't reflect the
traditional
Republican values.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to see a Republican Party
that is a
big tent, inclusive party that
welcomes all

41:45.837 --> 41:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to be Republicans and to
contribute
their ideas and support our
position of providing

41:47.605 --> 41:49.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunity to the American
people. And I
believe he goes in the opposite
direction

41:49.040 --> 41:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and deepens the divisions that
are so pervasive
in our society today.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you acknowledged
in your piece
today that ran in The Washington
Post that

41:52.677 --> 41:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is connecting with some
discontent in our
country and perhaps that Bernie
Sanders was

41:53.244 --> 41:54.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as well, you wrote. So,

41:54.579 --> 41:56.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is that? And who can speak
to that in
this election year?

41:56.347 --> 41:58.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I see that
disconnect
very clearly in my own state of
Maine, where

41:58.216 --> 42:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are people who have been
affected by
mill closures, some of which
have been brought

42:00.051 --> 42:01.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about by poorly negotiated trade
agreements,
and they do feel marginalized
and left behind.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have not been able to find
new work,
despite the fact that they did
nothing wrong

42:03.621 --> 42:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that caused them to lose their
jobs. Both
parties need to do a better job
of reaching

42:05.556 --> 42:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to those individuals, to
those hardworking
families, and providing job
training, matching

42:06.724 --> 42:08.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people and giving them new
skills for new
jobs.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is the one area where I
think Donald
Trump is striking a chord that
really resonates

42:10.361 --> 42:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and should resonate. Both
parties need to
do a better job of rejecting
poorly negotiated

42:12.330 --> 42:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade agreements. And I would
put the president's
TPP, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership agreement,

42:12.830 --> 42:14.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in that category.

42:14.632 --> 42:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have lost thousands of
manufacturing jobs
just in the state of Maine
alone, and that

42:15.700 --> 42:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resonates with people, and
understandably
so.

42:16.701 --> 42:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Would you support
Hillary Clinton?

42:17.402 --> 42:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I would not.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did work well with Hillary
when she was
my colleague in the Senate, and
I certainly

42:21.005 --> 42:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't bear her any ill will. But
when I listened
carefully to her commencement
speech, what

42:22.874 --> 42:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I heard was a laundry list of
very expensive
new programs that our country
simply cannot

42:24.409 --> 42:26.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
afford, and that would add to
our already
overwhelming $17 trillion debt.

42:26.144 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm also disturbed by the
mismatch in her
answers to the questions about
her e-mail

42:27.779 --> 42:29.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
server and what the FBI Director
Comey says
that the FBI's investigation
found.

42:29.647 --> 42:30.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: You said
commencement speech,
but I'm pretty sure you meant
convention speech.

42:30.214 --> 42:30.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think that's right.

42:30.915 --> 42:32.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I'm sorry.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Can I -- have you
ever met Donald
Trump?

42:33.985 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: I have only
met him once.
It was when he spoke to the
Republican Caucus.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that time, I suggested that
he present
a more positive agenda to the
American people.

42:37.522 --> 42:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I used the example of
supporting more
funding for biomedical research,
which has

42:39.023 --> 42:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a real priority among
Republicans in
both the House and the Senate.

42:40.892 --> 42:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And would you
suggest to any of
you colleagues that they join
you and oppose

42:41.993 --> 42:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him, those who have endorsed him
already especially?

42:43.828 --> 42:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Each of my
colleagues
has to make his or her own
decision. I wouldn't

42:45.029 --> 42:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presume to tell them what
decision they should
make.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been heartened by the
number of e-mails
that I have received and text
messages from

42:48.666 --> 42:50.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleagues in the Senate on both
sides of
the aisle applauding my op-ed
and supporting

42:50.368 --> 42:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I have done. Now, to be
sure, there are
those who disagree with me as
well.

42:50.802 --> 42:52.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

42:52.470 --> 42:53.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Susan Collins,
Republican of Maine,
thank you very much for your
time.

42:53.171 --> 42:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you.

42:54.972 --> 42:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we begin
an occasional
series about people living with
autism and

42:56.040 --> 42:57.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other spectrum disorders, A
Place in the World.

42:57.775 --> 42:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While reporting the history of
autism for
their book, "In a Different Key:
The Story

42:59.610 --> 43:00.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Autism," co-authors John
Donvan and Caren
Zucker found a program in
Phoenix, Arizona,

43:00.745 --> 43:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that expands options for people
living with
autism.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the first of two
reports.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN, Co-Author, "In a
Different Key:
The Story of Autism": Why is it
a big deal

43:05.082 --> 43:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Josh Kluger gets up every
morning and
makes his own breakfast and
straightens up

43:07.084 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the place a little, and then
remembers, belatedly
to go back and grab his lunch
before he heads

43:08.920 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off to work, which takes a
quarter-mile hike,
texting all the way, before he
reaches the

43:10.354 --> 43:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bus stop, and then a 45-minute
trip with one
transfer along the way?

43:12.156 --> 43:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I comes on board and
Josh shows me
how to swipe my ticket, why is
that a big

43:14.091 --> 43:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal? Because, until last year,
Josh had experienced
none of this. No apartment. No
paying job.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No bus pass even. Actually, he'd
never ridden
a bus on his own before last
year.

43:16.294 --> 43:17.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How old are you now?

43:17.228 --> 43:18.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER, Program
Participant: I'm 36.

43:19.030 --> 43:19.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: You only really
began being able
to ride the bus when you were
already over

43:19.297 --> 43:19.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
30?

43:19.997 --> 43:20.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSH KLUGER: I think so, yes.

43:20.932 --> 43:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: What did you have
to learn?

43:21.899 --> 43:23.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH KLUGER: I know learned how
-- streets.

43:23.901 --> 43:25.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And though Josh is
not the chattiest
person around, except perhaps
when he's texting,

43:25.603 --> 43:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can tell from his stride and
from his
air of confidence about where
he's heading

43:26.704 --> 43:27.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Josh really likes the life
he has right
now.

43:27.138 --> 43:27.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is this ours?

43:27.638 --> 43:28.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: Yes.

43:28.072 --> 43:29.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN DONVAN: OK.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And that he's going
to keep going
with it, autism or not.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: With autism, it's
usually been
the kids whose faces we see when
the topic

43:33.177 --> 43:35.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is discussed, children like
these. We root
for their success in school and
on the playground,

43:35.146 --> 43:36.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we have come to recognize
that even a
little boy like this one, who
may look disconnected,

43:36.948 --> 43:37.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and whose autism keeps him from
speaking many
words, nevertheless can sing and
therefore

43:37.582 --> 43:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also has something to say.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOY (singing): Never give up on
wishes.

43:40.251 --> 43:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But the kids grow
up inevitably,
so that the boys whose photo you
just saw,

43:40.918 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have become these men.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We gathered them together to
make a point.
This one is now 19-year-old
Dylan. And this

43:43.588 --> 43:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little boy called Stuart, he is
now 22.

43:45.490 --> 43:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Josh, you have met. He is 36.
This kid, he
is 21 now and named Ian. Craig,
he's a 26-year-old

43:46.624 --> 43:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. And Jake, he grew into a
man also. He's
22.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the point is, adults don't
get nearly
the attention and support the
kids do, maybe

43:50.228 --> 43:52.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're not as cute or
because people
forget that autism is lifelong.
But it is.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that fact is the driving
idea behind a
new pilot program called First
Place Transition

43:53.965 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Academy, located in Phoenix,
Arizona, in which
these same young men are today
the pioneers.

43:55.233 --> 43:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Are you going to mix it?
Where would
you find that?

43:55.733 --> 43:56.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: In the store.

43:56.267 --> 43:58.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: In the store?

43:58.102 --> 43:59.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: There are nine of
them in all,
paired off together in a cluster
of apartments

43:59.871 --> 44:01.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in a complex where their
neighbors are mostly
retirees who have no autism
connection.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They eat together and learn
together, two
years of specialized training
designed to

44:03.508 --> 44:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improve their odds of having,
let's call it,
a successful adulthood, which
means what?

44:04.842 --> 44:06.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
IAN MCCOY, Student: What
doughnuts would you
like for that one?

44:06.777 --> 44:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, take Ian, who
is now holding
down a paying job arranged for
by the program,

44:07.845 --> 44:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
showing that he can be good at
customer service.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: I got the lemonade
and morning
buzz.

44:10.915 --> 44:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Social interactions
can be enormously
challenging for people on the
spectrum. That's

44:12.583 --> 44:13.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
part of the reason that
unemployment among
autistic adults hovers near 80
percent.

44:13.384 --> 44:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: Hello. How's it
going?

44:14.018 --> 44:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Pretty good, I guess.

44:15.586 --> 44:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Not long ago, that
included Ian,
who is an unfailing optimist.

44:16.921 --> 44:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before you came here, where were
you? Were
you in high school?

44:18.656 --> 44:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: I was in my parents'
house for
at least two years. I enrolled.
Here I am

44:19.657 --> 44:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now a year later. I am satisfied
with my future.

44:20.691 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: What is your
future? Do you know?

44:21.626 --> 44:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: It's hard to predict
right now.

44:22.193 --> 44:23.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Sure. Sure.

44:23.928 --> 44:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: It's a brief idea. I
would like
to live in an apartment, pay my
own rent,

44:25.663 --> 44:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have my own car and have a
career, in other
words, because I'm -- the
part-time job is

44:26.764 --> 44:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of tedious, but it's my
main focus for
now.

44:28.199 --> 44:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, that's all
about learning
how to do jobs, right?

44:28.866 --> 44:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: Absolutely, yes.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: The other men go to
other workplaces,
a garden that raises produce for
sales to

44:31.068 --> 44:31.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
restaurants.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Awesome.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN MCCOY: An animal shelter
which happens
to be a volunteer job, but that
doesn't matter.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Knowing how to be professionally
responsible
and productive does, like being
on time for

44:36.807 --> 44:38.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work, dressing correctly for the
situation,
completing tasks assigned
reliably.

44:38.743 --> 44:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are learned skills that do
not necessarily
come easily to all members of
the group because

44:39.176 --> 44:40.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their autism.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD HERRON-VALENZUELA, Gateway
Community
College: So, on the worksheet,
guys, you are

44:42.980 --> 44:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting a check mark for the
items that you're
going to need to purchase in
your first apartment.

44:44.882 --> 44:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And support staff
literally imparts
lessons on the logistics of
adult life, like

44:46.817 --> 44:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this session held in a lecture
hall made available
by Gateway Community College.
It's a class

44:48.586 --> 44:49.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on how to navigate the options
available in
public transport, how to get
from here to

44:49.120 --> 44:49.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there, with quizzes.

44:49.754 --> 44:50.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Exact fare required.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Exact fare required.

44:52.323 --> 44:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: When it comes to
successful adulthood,
it's this sort of
mundane-seeming know-how

44:52.990 --> 44:54.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that can in fact be crucial.

44:54.225 --> 44:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important is that to their
success in
this program?

44:55.993 --> 44:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD HERRON-VALENZUELA: Yes,
it's critical.
And it's one of the skills that
we target

44:57.762 --> 44:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really early on. I mean, again,
this is the
thing that's going to allow them
to access

44:59.664 --> 45:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employment. It's going to allow
them to access
different social activities,
different quality

45:00.097 --> 45:01.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of life things.

45:01.232 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: So getting around
is key to independence?

45:02.300 --> 45:04.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRAD HERRON-VALENZUELA:
Absolutely. It's critical.

45:04.135 --> 45:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Which brings us
back to Josh.
That 45-minute commute of his
landed us here.

45:04.969 --> 45:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is your place of work,
huh?

45:05.469 --> 45:06.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: Yes.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Wow.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Josh works for the Arizona
Diamondbacks baseball
team. He and another member of
the group named

45:09.807 --> 45:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jake, they have been cycling
through a variety
of jobs here, some in the office
upstairs,

45:11.275 --> 45:12.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now they're getting their
hands dirty
with grounds maintenance.

45:12.109 --> 45:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Josh, you're not a big baseball
fan.

45:12.677 --> 45:14.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: I'm not.

45:14.245 --> 45:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But you're a work
fan. It sounds
like you really love this job.

45:14.812 --> 45:15.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KLUGER: In a way.

45:15.446 --> 45:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: In a way. Oh.

45:15.813 --> 45:17.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:17.682 --> 45:18.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: OK. But he loves
being a working
man, even though his boss here,
Marian Rhodes,

45:18.516 --> 45:20.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says it has not always been
smooth.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES, Executive,
Arizona Diamondbacks:
He had a thing with his badge,
that he was

45:22.253 --> 45:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
losing his badge constantly. I
said, where's
your badge? And he's like, I
left it here,

45:22.620 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whatever.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said -- I had to explain
to him, your
badge is like the key to your
home. That's

45:26.223 --> 45:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the key to our ballpark. So, if
you lose it,
someone has the key to access
our building

45:28.092 --> 45:29.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at any time. And I said, so
what's the answer
here? We now have him drop the
badge off in

45:29.894 --> 45:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the morning and pick the badge
up. And so
he hasn't -- now he is always
clocked in and

45:30.294 --> 45:31.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
clocked out.

45:31.329 --> 45:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But that's what
learning is about.

45:33.030 --> 45:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you willing to let these
guys make mistakes
more than you would other
people?

45:33.664 --> 45:34.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES: Definitely.

45:34.165 --> 45:34.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Yes?

45:34.799 --> 45:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES: Definitely.

45:35.600 --> 45:36.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Why is that
important?

45:36.867 --> 45:38.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIAN RHODES: Because you have
to meet them
where they are.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Josh's mom has been
astounded
by the change she's seen in the
past 12 months.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER, Mother of Josh
Kluger: There
are so many ways that he has
changed and grown,

45:42.506 --> 45:43.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's going to school, he's
learning classes.
He's taking responsibilities for
his homework.

45:43.507 --> 45:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's taking responsibility for
his budgeting.

45:44.208 --> 45:44.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: This is all new?

45:44.909 --> 45:46.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: This is all new.

45:46.277 --> 45:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: This is something
he learned
as a middle-aged man?

45:47.111 --> 45:47.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: As a middle-aged
man.

45:47.612 --> 45:49.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Wow.

45:49.113 --> 45:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: The growth has
been amazing.
It's really been amazing.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: If Josh were not
here, where
would he be in life?

45:52.283 --> 45:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE KLUGER: At our house,
doing probably
the same thing, and not being
very happy.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know what his future
would have
been.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And back at the
apartment complex,
you can see how these guys, some
of whom had

45:56.921 --> 45:58.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no friends to speak of before in
their lives,
are learning to help each other
out.

45:58.656 --> 46:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are, in short, a community.
And while
this pilot project has enrolled
only men,

46:00.524 --> 46:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who today make up roughly 80
percent of people
recognized as autistic, the full
program will

46:01.225 --> 46:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grow to include women as well.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now something needs to be
said as that
group shot we started with, and
in particular

46:04.862 --> 46:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the man on the lower
right. He was once
that singing boy, and, in fact,
he doesn't

46:06.731 --> 46:08.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live with the other men. He
can't, because
his autism affects him
differently from the

46:08.432 --> 46:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others. But there is a place
being built in
Phoenix that will also have room
for him.

46:09.133 --> 46:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That story in part two tomorrow.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

46:11.636 --> 46:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what an assistant
principal learned from spending
the day with

46:13.437 --> 46:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a student; the man with amnesia
who taught
us about memory; and creating
art with a lawn

46:13.738 --> 46:15.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mower.

46:15.539 --> 46:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first: It's
been three
weeks since a failed coup
attempt rocked the

46:16.040 --> 46:17.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nation of Turkey.

46:17.842 --> 46:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, thousands have been
arrested in
a crackdown on suspected
plotters, including

46:18.809 --> 46:20.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military officers, educators and
journalists.

46:20.645 --> 46:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, there was no mistaking
the message
from Turkey's leader has
changed, by his choice

46:21.178 --> 46:22.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of where to travel.

46:22.947 --> 46:23.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A telling moment in St.
Petersburg: Russia's
President Vladimir Putin
welcomed Turkey's

46:23.648 --> 46:25.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,

46:25.516 --> 46:27.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): The relations
between Russia

46:27.251 --> 46:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Turkey entered into a really
positive
stage. I am sure that steps we
both take will

46:27.818 --> 46:29.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
widen our cooperation.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): Your visit today
means that we

46:31.522 --> 46:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all want at renewal of our
dialogue and restoration
of our relations in the
interests of Russian

46:32.056 --> 46:33.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Turkish peoples.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's their first
meeting since
those relations were sent into a
tailspin

46:35.626 --> 46:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last November, when Turkey shot
down a Russian
warplane near the Syrian border.
Erdogan has

46:37.161 --> 46:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since apologized, and, today,
the two pledged
to restart commercial deals.

46:38.996 --> 46:40.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will also discuss their
differences over
Syria. Erdogan wants President
Bashar al-Assad

46:40.765 --> 46:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ousted, but Russian airpower has
helped keep
him in place. The visit also
comes as the

46:42.166 --> 46:43.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
July coup attempt has triggered
tensions between
Turkey and the West.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN (through
translator):
Does the West support terrorism
or not? Does

46:45.169 --> 46:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the West side with democracy or
the coup or
terrorism?

46:47.038 --> 46:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Erdogan accuses a
former ally,
cleric Fethullah Gulen, of
fomenting the coup.

46:48.906 --> 46:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lives in Pennsylvania, and
Turkey wants
the U.S. to extradite him
immediately. Today,

46:50.708 --> 46:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Turkish justice minister
said the U.S.
is risking relations with a NATO
ally by not

46:51.242 --> 46:52.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
handing Gulen over.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration says
the normal extradition
process must play out.

46:54.679 --> 46:55.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH TRUDEAU, State
Department Spokesperson:
We expect all parties, media,
civil society,

46:55.646 --> 46:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Turkish government, to be
responsible.

46:57.415 --> 46:59.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
millions turned
out in Istanbul on Sunday in a
mass show of

46:59.216 --> 47:00.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support for Erdogan. All the
while, purges
continue throughout the Turkish
military and

47:00.985 --> 47:02.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public sector. To date, more
than 16,000 people
have been arrested over the coup
attempt.

47:02.920 --> 47:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands more, including judges
and educators,
have been sacked. Journalists
have been detained

47:03.854 --> 47:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and scores of news organizations
shut down.

47:05.756 --> 47:07.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now for more on this,
Kemal Kirisci,
a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution.

47:07.692 --> 47:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Henri Barkey, he's director
of the Middle
East program at the Woodrow
Wilson International

47:08.225 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Center for Scholars.

47:08.893 --> 47:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Henri Barkey, to you first.

47:11.395 --> 47:13.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You were in Turkey for a
conference the weekend
the coup took place. You have
been accused

47:13.197 --> 47:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Turkish media of having
played a role
in fomenting the coup. Is there
any truth

47:13.497 --> 47:15.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that?

47:15.299 --> 47:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY, Woodrow Wilson
International
Center for Scholars: Of course
not. I mean,

47:17.101 --> 47:17.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's complete, complete
imagination. They
just want to accuse America, and
they're using

47:17.601 --> 47:18.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us as a scapegoat.

47:18.569 --> 47:20.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so they just
made it up?

47:20.304 --> 47:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: Oh, they made up
-- the stories
that they made up are so
incredible, that

47:22.139 --> 47:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not worth repeating on
the air, but
they involve fanciful American
criminals who

47:23.674 --> 47:25.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came from California to help us
do things,
to -- complete, complete
fiction.

47:25.443 --> 47:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were on an island 45 minutes
away from
all the events and doing our
job, which was

47:25.876 --> 47:27.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a conference.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kemal Kirisci,
who do you believe
was behind the coup?

47:29.113 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEMAL KIRISCI, Brookings
Institution: I very
much empathize and agree with my
colleague

47:30.948 --> 47:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Henri Barkey, but I think one
also has to
understand that this nation is
going through

47:31.649 --> 47:33.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a major shock, a major trauma.

47:33.451 --> 47:35.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a coup attempt. It was
a bloody
coup attempt. Turkey has had
previous experiences

47:35.219 --> 47:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with coups. But none of them
have been directed
towards the public in the manner
in which

47:37.121 --> 47:38.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this has taken place. None of
the previous
coups attacked actually the
Turkish Parliament.

47:38.923 --> 47:40.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people on their own
steam at first,
and then galvanized the
president of Turkey,

47:40.825 --> 47:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stood up against this coup, and
feel that
they have succeeded in
protecting their democracy,

47:41.892 --> 47:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as much as this democracy may
have its problems.

47:43.761 --> 47:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the country is also -- has a
longstanding
tradition of, unfortunately,
anti-Americanism,

47:45.529 --> 47:46.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-Westernism and skepticism
towards the
West. And a number of issues
have aligned

47:46.897 --> 47:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one after the other that is
fueling this perspective
on the West.

47:48.566 --> 47:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
stop you
there, because I want to get to
this point

47:50.501 --> 47:51.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Turkish government has --
they have repeatedly
said and suggested that the
United States

47:51.035 --> 47:52.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was behind the coup.

47:52.770 --> 47:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Henri Barkey, is there any
evidence that ties
the United States to what
happened?

47:54.538 --> 47:55.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: Look, there is
absolutely no
evidence. There is no reason for
the United

47:56.006 --> 47:57.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States to execute a coup. It's
not in the
interests the United States.

47:57.842 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey and the United States
have been working.
Although they have
disagreements, they were

47:59.610 --> 48:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working very closely on Syria
with the two
countries. There was an
agreement between

48:01.011 --> 48:02.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama and President
Erdogan as to
what to do in Syria.

48:02.747 --> 48:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The days of coups over. No
administration
in the United States in the 21st
century is

48:04.515 --> 48:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going the sanction a coup in
Turkey. But this
fallacy in Turkey that
everything is done

48:06.250 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the United States, it's an
easy way of
blaming others for domestic
issues.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kemal Kirisci,
how do you explain
this? I mean, the Turkish
government has said

48:09.453 --> 48:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. is involved. What do
you believe
about that?

48:11.155 --> 48:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: You know, there's
very many
conflicting views that are
coming out.

48:13.090 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the one hand, there is what
you have just
said, what Henri has said. But
then the spokesman

48:14.892 --> 48:15.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the president, Ibrahim Kalin,
keeps saying
that that's not the position of
the Turkish

48:15.526 --> 48:17.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government and presidency.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, on the other hand, I have
watched hours
and hours of TV debate, and, in
those debates,

48:19.330 --> 48:20.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunately, people of high
military ranks,
including a former chief of
staff, is convinced

48:21.031 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is an American finger
somewhere
along the way, directly or
indirectly.

48:22.767 --> 48:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henri Barkey,
what are the
consequences of that if this
continues in

48:23.067 --> 48:24.935 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey?

48:24.969 --> 48:26.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HENRI BARKEY: Well, the
consequences are serious.
At the moment, the American
government is

48:26.203 --> 48:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to keep low and not to
make too much
of a fuss.

48:28.005 --> 48:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, unfortunately, the longer
this lasts,
the more the Turkish officials
directly or

48:29.807 --> 48:30.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indirectly attack the United
States, the more
the American -- Turkish public
is going to

48:30.441 --> 48:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become more anti-American.

48:32.276 --> 48:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have already seen the
consequences.
Fulbright has canceled now for
next year its

48:32.643 --> 48:33.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
-- its...

48:33.344 --> 48:35.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scholar exchange.

48:35.079 --> 48:35.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: ... scholars going
forward,
because people are afraid that
the Americans

48:35.513 --> 48:37.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will be at risk.

48:37.348 --> 48:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, it's more than
just Americans
being at risk. It's the fact
that it would

48:39.216 --> 48:40.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be very difficult for Turkish
officials and
American officials, especially
at the military

48:40.584 --> 48:42.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level, to work together in a
harmonious way
as they did before.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Kemal
Kirisci, we're
hearing that officials in the
Erdogan government

48:44.288 --> 48:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are saying this. What about
President Erdogan
himself? Do you think he
believes that the

48:44.789 --> 48:46.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. was involved?

48:46.290 --> 48:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: If you listen to
his rhetoric,
I think you would say yes.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, it's very difficult to
go into his
mind. He can also be very
pragmatic when he

48:50.060 --> 48:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chooses to be. I think the point
here is that
there was a coup attempt and
there are allegations,

48:51.962 --> 48:52.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for some, quite convincing
allegations, that
individuals belonging to the
Gulenist movement

48:52.496 --> 48:54.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were involved in it.

48:54.298 --> 48:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a consequence, an ally of the
United States,
a member of NATO's military is
in a mess.

48:56.133 --> 48:57.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country is in a state of
turmoil. And
from my perspective, I think
these allegations

48:57.902 --> 48:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to be taken seriously, and
maybe some
cooperation put into place to
investigate

48:59.837 --> 49:00.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether they are true or not,
independently
of the extradition issue that
was made reference

49:00.104 --> 49:01.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

49:01.872 --> 49:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean --
you're talking
about extraditing the cleric,
the Turkish

49:02.573 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cleric who is in Pennsylvania.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEMAL KIRISCI: Yes.

49:04.975 --> 49:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. has said
they don't
have the evidence to proceed
with an extradition.

49:06.844 --> 49:07.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just to be clear, what are
you saying
by an investigation? What are
you saying needs

49:07.278 --> 49:09.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be done here?

49:09.146 --> 49:11.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: For the average
Turkish mind,
it's very difficult not -- not
to think that

49:11.048 --> 49:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States wouldn't have
some access
to intelligence information,
when, for example,,

49:12.850 --> 49:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the commander of the Incirlik
base group,
with whom the United States
shares the base,

49:14.752 --> 49:15.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was amongst the instigators of
the coup and
even attempted to seek asylum
with U.S. military

49:15.252 --> 49:17.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
authorities there.

49:17.054 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, put yourself in the shoes of
an average
Turkish person, and maybe
officials as well,

49:18.889 --> 49:20.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and look at the United States,
look at its
resources, look at its
intelligence networks.

49:20.724 --> 49:21.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It becomes very difficult to
convince them
that somehow the United States
was oblivious

49:21.392 --> 49:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to what was coming up there.

49:21.959 --> 49:22.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

49:22.359 --> 49:24.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:24.061 --> 49:24.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: ... prepared
personally to
go along with it, but that's the
state of

49:24.361 --> 49:26.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm suggesting that the
United States
has a stake, the government has
a stake to

49:27.832 --> 49:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperate with their counterpart
and look
into whatever intelligence and
information

49:29.200 --> 49:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be available through the
networks that
the U.S. has access.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henri Barkey, is
there a way
to do that? Where do you see
this going?

49:32.736 --> 49:34.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: I actually think
the only way
this is going to end is if
there's a very

49:34.572 --> 49:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forceful response from the
United States that
asks President Erdogan needs to
squash these

49:34.872 --> 49:36.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stories.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only person in Turkey who
can squash these
stories is Mr. Erdogan. If he
gets up and

49:38.576 --> 49:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says, "I don't believe the
United States was
involved, we have no evidence to
that effect,"

49:39.443 --> 49:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will put most of the rumors
aside.

49:41.178 --> 49:42.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for that, I think President
Obama has
to get involved. It's not going
to happen

49:42.313 --> 49:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because some State Department
spokesperson
said...

49:44.181 --> 49:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, President
Obama has said
this absolutely, unequivocally
didn't happen,

49:45.916 --> 49:47.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that there was no U.S.
involvement. So, what
more are you saying President
Obama...

49:47.484 --> 49:49.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: He said this in a
press interview
with President Nieto of Mexico.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to address directly the
Turkish press,
maybe invite the Turkish press
to the White

49:51.222 --> 49:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House, and challenge also
President Erdogan.
He can't let this go on like
this. There won't

49:52.389 --> 49:54.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be an investigation. There
cannot be an investigation.

49:54.058 --> 49:54.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying the
administration
hasn't taken it seriously
enough?

49:54.725 --> 49:56.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HENRI BARKEY: Right. Right.

49:56.527 --> 49:56.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, they have taken it
seriously, but they're
choosing to keep quiet. And that
keeps the

49:56.961 --> 49:58.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rumors going.

49:58.362 --> 49:58.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Henri Barkey,
Kemal Kirisci,
thanks to both of you.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEMAL KIRISCI: Thank you.

50:00.798 --> 50:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: High school students
and parents
sometimes say principals and
teachers don't

50:02.600 --> 50:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite understand what it's like
to be a student
these days. It turns out there's
an effort

50:04.501 --> 50:05.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to change that. Some 1,300
principals recently
took a day off from their usual
role and instead

50:05.436 --> 50:07.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
followed one of their students
for a day.

50:07.171 --> 50:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The approach came from two
groups outside
the traditional field of public
education,

50:09.006 --> 50:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Design School at Stanford
University,
and IDEO, a design company based
in Palo Alto,

50:09.406 --> 50:11.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Education
Week followed one principal
through the first

50:13.177 --> 50:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever national Shadow a Student
Day Challenge.
It's part of our weekly
education series on

50:13.677 --> 50:15.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Making the Grade.

50:15.512 --> 50:17.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAREN RITTER, Assistant
Principal, East Leyden
High School: My name is Karen
Ritter. I'm

50:17.214 --> 50:18.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an assistant principal at East
Leyden High
School, which is just outside of
Chicago.

50:18.148 --> 50:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, today, I will be shadowing
a student.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Why are you doing
this?

50:20.684 --> 50:22.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: Just to get a
sense of what
students go through during the
day.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't really get to spend a
lot of time
with students. Usually, I'm in
charge of things

50:24.455 --> 50:25.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the teachers are involved
in. So, this
includes teacher evaluations,
teacher attendance,

50:25.823 --> 50:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professional development. I
would say 50 percent
is in meetings.

50:27.124 --> 50:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Do you feel like
you know what
goes on here?

50:28.926 --> 50:29.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: I -- I do, just
because I do
observe a lot of classrooms.
Now, I'm looking

50:29.894 --> 50:31.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at it more from the teacher's
perspective.

50:31.395 --> 50:33.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now I want to know what it
feels like
through the lens of a student.

50:33.230 --> 50:33.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Her public high
school serves
some 1,700 students and is both
racially and

50:33.797 --> 50:34.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economically diverse.

50:34.765 --> 50:35.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Karen is following a
ninth-grader.

50:35.466 --> 50:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: Wait for me, Alan.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Alan Garcia.

50:37.968 --> 50:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: I first met him
because he came
to my office and said he wanted
to talk about

50:39.770 --> 50:41.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his schedule for next year. He's
in a lot
of remedial classes, and he
wanted to be changed

50:41.438 --> 50:43.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of those classes. So, I
really want to
know what makes him feel that
way.

50:43.407 --> 50:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: She hopes to find
out, not just
observing Alan's classes, but by
fully participating

50:44.942 --> 50:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his entire day, which started
at 7:35,
with a boost of physical
education.

50:46.577 --> 50:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: This is the class
I was most
nervous about, because I don't
run.

(LAUGHTER)

50:48.812 --> 50:50.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Her stamina would
be put to
the test by what comes next,
seven more 50-minute

50:50.547 --> 50:52.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
periods, starting with learning
center for
one-on-one help, followed by
Alan's usual

50:52.349 --> 50:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two-hour double math class, then
barely pausing
for a bite, before jumping into
the second

50:54.084 --> 50:55.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
half of the day, four
back-to-back classes,
literacy, computers, English and
freshman

50:55.486 --> 50:56.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seminar, until the 3:00 p.m.
dismissal bell
marks the finish line.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it like having Ms.
Ritter follow you
around?

50:58.455 --> 50:59.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GARCIA, East Leyden High
School Student:
Having the assistant principal
follow you

50:59.290 --> 50:59.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everywhere, it's -- it feels
weird.

50:59.657 --> 51:01.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:01.325 --> 51:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: And for Karen? We
checked in
with her about halfway through
the day.

51:02.026 --> 51:02.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: I'm holding up.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:04.194 --> 51:06.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: I definitely feel
like my energy
level has gone down since this
morning. I

51:06.096 --> 51:07.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had to write an essay in
literacy, and I felt
like I had a hard time
concentrating and trying

51:07.364 --> 51:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to focus. Yes, it's a lot of
sitting and a
lot of thinking.

51:09.266 --> 51:11.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, like algebra, algebra block,
so it's a
double period. That was hard,
because, especially,

51:11.035 --> 51:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's over a couple different
lunch periods.
So, every time the bell rang, I
wanted to

51:12.803 --> 51:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get up and leave. But it's like,
oh, no, we
have another period to go. More
time to go.

51:14.538 --> 51:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Double period math
is one of
the remedial classes Alan wants
to change.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GARCIA: It's really boring.
And it gets
me exhausted at times, just
sitting down for

51:18.175 --> 51:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two hours. It gets me mad and
sometimes puts
me down, because I'm like, I
could be like

51:19.944 --> 51:20.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learning new stuff. Instead, I'm
stuck with
something I have been doing for
like seven,

51:20.477 --> 51:21.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sixth, eighth grade.

51:21.545 --> 51:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: So, what do you
want to be doing?

51:23.480 --> 51:25.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GARCIA: I would like to be
taking, French,
like, woods, metals, all those
types of classes.

51:25.282 --> 51:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: Because Alan is in
the classes
that he is, he doesn't have the
opportunity

51:27.084 --> 51:28.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a lot of those electives. He
was placed
in certain classes because of
his test scores,

51:28.419 --> 51:29.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but I don't know if he
necessarily needs to
be in that level.

51:29.486 --> 51:30.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was getting things and
teaching them to
me.

51:30.054 --> 51:30.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, you got it.

51:30.754 --> 51:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: Alan helped me.

51:31.188 --> 51:31.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Really?

51:31.689 --> 51:33.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN RITTER: Yes.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Alan represents someone
who is very
representative of our school,
middle-of-the-road

51:35.392 --> 51:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kid who, when challenged, can
reach high,
very high expectations. And I
think maybe

51:37.194 --> 51:38.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeping him at a certain level
might hinder
his opportunity to do that. So,
I would like

51:38.896 --> 51:39.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see more opportunities given
to students.
And maybe we need to rethink the
way that

51:39.863 --> 51:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we place students, not based on
test scores.

51:40.864 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: How else had her
views changed?

51:42.666 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To find out, we asked Karen to
grade East
Leyden High School on some key
measures, both

51:44.501 --> 51:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before and after her shadow day.
Keep in mind,
her view was limited to just
Alan's classes.

51:45.202 --> 51:47.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We began with this statement:

51:47.171 --> 51:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this school, students learn
actively, creating,
questioning, discovering. Your
grade yesterday

51:47.604 --> 51:48.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a B. Today?

51:48.439 --> 51:50.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: I would say a
C-minus.

51:50.174 --> 51:51.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Her scores also
went down for
student engagement, from B to
C-plus.

51:51.976 --> 51:52.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And relevance, how often
teachers drew a clear
connection between students'
work and the

51:52.843 --> 51:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside world, that dropped from
C to D.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: So, we're looking
for creativity.

51:55.646 --> 51:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But her take on
school climate
and the expectations, both
remained high.

51:57.481 --> 51:59.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN RITTER: Yes, we have some
work to do.
We have some things that we can
fix. But it's

51:59.450 --> 51:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great place. I think we
provide a safe environment
for kids. We have plenty of
resources for

51:59.750 --> 52:01.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

52:01.719 --> 52:03.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I will do some more
shadow experiences
with an ELL student, with a
special-ed student,

52:03.454 --> 52:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with an AP-level student,
because I think
they do have different
experiences here.

52:04.388 --> 52:06.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was fun. Do we have to do
it again?

52:06.223 --> 52:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point is to know what the
students are
thinking and wanting, and start
with them.

52:08.025 --> 52:08.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: In Franklin Park,
Illinois,
I'm John Tulenko of Education
Week, reporting

52:08.592 --> 52:10.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the "PBS NewsHour."

52:10.527 --> 52:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a story of
scientific history,
human drama, and ethical
controversies shaped

52:11.161 --> 52:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
around the idea of memory.

52:12.396 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find Jeffrey Brown at
our "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

52:14.198 --> 52:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In recent
decades, scientists
have made great advances in
understanding

52:16.066 --> 52:17.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how and where the human brain
makes and stores
memories, a key part of forming
our identities.

52:17.901 --> 52:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man who unwittingly helped
them do it, Henry
Molaison, who underwent a
lobotomy in 1953

52:19.703 --> 52:21.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
intended to relieve his
epileptic seizures.
A large part of his hippocampus
was removed.

52:21.538 --> 52:23.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH, Author, "Patient
H.M.: A Story
of Memory, Madness, and Family
Secrets": As

52:23.307 --> 52:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soon as he came out of the
operating room,
it became clear that he was no
longer able

52:23.874 --> 52:25.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to create new memories.

52:25.609 --> 52:27.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this gave scientists for
the first
time really a clear sense of how
important

52:27.444 --> 52:29.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these structures were to the
creation of new
memories. And that was sort of
the first and

52:29.113 --> 52:30.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many ways most fundamental
thing that he
taught us about how memory
works.

52:30.948 --> 52:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his new book,
Luke Dittrich
tells the story of the man known
for decades

52:32.883 --> 52:34.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Patient H.M., considered the
most important
research subject in the history
of brain science.

52:34.818 --> 52:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's more. The lobotomy
was performed
by Dittrich's grandfather, Dr.
William Scoville,

52:36.720 --> 52:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a prominent brain surgeon at a
time when such
procedures were done by the
thousands. I spoke

52:37.721 --> 52:39.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Luke Dittrich at Washington's
Lincoln Theatre.

52:39.490 --> 52:39.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: I personally
found it to be
a very shocking story during the
course of

52:39.923 --> 52:41.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my reporting.

52:41.759 --> 52:43.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This came to be during an era
when the lines
between medical practice and
medical research

52:43.660 --> 52:44.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were fairly blurry, and, you
know, people
crossed some lines that they
most likely shouldn't

52:44.094 --> 52:45.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have crossed.

52:45.162 --> 52:45.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And this is the
era of lobotomies.

52:45.863 --> 52:47.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: That's correct.

52:47.664 --> 52:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that my
research led
me deep into was the history of
the lobotomy

52:49.566 --> 52:51.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of this whole field known as
psychosurgeries
that came out of desperate
times, the mentally

52:51.335 --> 52:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ill at the time, in the sort of
1930s and
1940s. There were no -- there
were no real

52:53.137 --> 52:53.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good, effective treatments for a
lot of the
things that they suffered from,
and the lobotomy

52:53.971 --> 52:54.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rose up as a sort of -- a quick
fix.

52:54.671 --> 52:55.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it had serious consequences.

52:55.939 --> 52:56.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We live in an age
now of neuroscience.
Right?

52:56.507 --> 52:57.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's sort of everywhere.

52:57.041 --> 52:57.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LUKE DITTRICH: Yes.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With a lot of new
technology.

52:59.777 --> 53:00.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a period not so long
ago, in the
20th century, where very little
was known

53:00.210 --> 53:02.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about the brain.

53:02.079 --> 53:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: Two millennia
ago, doctors
really thought nothing of
performing vivisections

53:03.180 --> 53:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on live prisoners in order to
understand anatomy.

53:05.082 --> 53:06.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thankfully, our standards of
medical ethics
have evolved quite a bit. But I
do think that

53:06.884 --> 53:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
readers will be shocked to see
kind of how
bad things were back in the
middle of the

53:07.317 --> 53:09.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20th century.

53:09.053 --> 53:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a very
personal story
for you, because the doctor who
performed

53:10.120 --> 53:12.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the surgery on Patient H.M. was
your grandfather.

53:12.156 --> 53:14.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: My grandfather
was a neurosurgeon.
He was, by all accounts, a
brilliant neurosurgeon

53:14.058 --> 53:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a renowned one. He was -- he
founded and
was the director for many years
of the Department

53:15.759 --> 53:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Neurosurgery at Hartford
Hospital. He was
a Yale professor. He did a lot
of good.

53:17.661 --> 53:19.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he saved a lot of lives.
He also was
one of the world's most sort of
zealous proponents

53:19.496 --> 53:21.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of psychosurgery and one of the
world's most
prolific lobotomists. And his
sort of driving

53:21.365 --> 53:22.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passion for the lobotomy and for
psychosurgery
grew in large part out of the
fact that his

53:22.366 --> 53:24.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own wife, my grandmother, was
mentally ill.

53:24.168 --> 53:25.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was institutionalized in one
of the same
asylums that he practiced in.
And he was,

53:25.936 --> 53:26.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, on a kind of -- on a
crusade, on
a sort of -- on a quest to
develop a cure

53:26.603 --> 53:28.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for his own wife's madness.

53:28.338 --> 53:30.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that struck me
in sort of
looking at the history of
psychosurgery is

53:30.174 --> 53:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how often, you know, how often
the lobotomized
individuals were women. There
are a number

53:31.942 --> 53:33.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of possible answers for why that
may be so,
but I think perhaps the most
compelling one

53:33.877 --> 53:35.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that a lot of the symptoms of
the lobotomy,
the passivity, tractability,
these were symptoms

53:35.646 --> 53:37.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that at the time were viewed as
kind of, you
know, ideal elements, according
to men, of

53:37.448 --> 53:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feminine traits, and that, in
some senses,
a lobotomized woman could be
viewed as almost

53:39.316 --> 53:40.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an ideal wife, which was one of
the sort of
horrifying things that I was
kind of grappling

53:40.184 --> 53:41.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with as I was looking at this
story.

53:41.919 --> 53:42.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And Henry
himself, how much
was he aware of his own role in
scientific

53:42.219 --> 53:43.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history?

53:43.754 --> 53:45.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: He certainly
didn't have a
clear awareness of his own role.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would be told many times that
he was famous
in a certain sense. As the
studies on him

53:47.324 --> 53:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went on, you know, certain
things would stick.
And so he may have by the end of
his life

53:49.259 --> 53:50.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had this, you know, vague sense
of his importance,
but he certainly didn't have any
sort of clear

53:50.694 --> 53:52.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense like we do of how deeply
and fundamentally
important he was.

53:52.529 --> 53:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Part of this
story goes on,
right, past Henry's life,
because you raise

53:54.264 --> 53:55.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some questions at the end about
the extent
of how much he was sort of
controlled, how

53:55.933 --> 53:57.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
much research on him was
controlled, how much
we really know the story in the
end.

53:57.734 --> 53:58.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: Some of the more
fascinating
chapters in Henry's history
really happened

53:58.836 --> 54:00.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite a few years after his
death, just recently.

54:00.637 --> 54:02.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story, in some sense, is
still unfolding.
The ethical questions
surrounding Henry's

54:02.506 --> 54:03.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story to me begin in that
operating room where
my grandfather made that
decision to operate.

54:03.807 --> 54:05.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that was a decision
that deserves
close scrutiny.

54:05.742 --> 54:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterwards, there are a number
of other questions
that, you know, follow
throughout the six

54:07.511 --> 54:07.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades of experimentation that
was done on
him, and, you know, even after
his death,

54:07.945 --> 54:08.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what was done...

54:08.912 --> 54:10.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Including who
owned his brain.

54:10.714 --> 54:11.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: Who owned his
brain, exactly.
A custody war basically broke
out over the

54:11.381 --> 54:12.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
possession of Henry's brain.

54:12.950 --> 54:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, well,
we will continue
that part of the story online.

54:14.151 --> 54:14.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will invite our watchers
to go there
later on.

54:15.018 --> 54:15.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For now, the book is "Patient
H.M."

54:15.853 --> 54:16.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Luke Dittrich, thank you so
much.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUKE DITTRICH: Thank you so much
for having
me.

54:18.722 --> 54:19.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight's "NewsHour"
Shares come
from Roger Baker, an artist
whose paintbrush

54:19.289 --> 54:20.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is often a lawn mower.

54:20.290 --> 54:21.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His latest work, a giant
portrait of Beethoven

54:21.959 --> 54:23.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER BAKER, Artist: My name is
Roger Baker.
I'm an artist, a commercial
artist.

54:23.694 --> 54:25.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So the field piece is an
expression of my
own personal interests. I start
with something

54:25.496 --> 54:25.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that I'm passionate and
interested in, so
it's real. I'm not cutting for
everybody else.

54:26.029 --> 54:27.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm cutting myself.

54:27.798 --> 54:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the first one I did in
2000, we cut
the Statue of Liberty. And after
the Statue

54:29.600 --> 54:30.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Liberty, we did Elvis. And
then we did
Einstein with the Museum of
Natural History

54:30.868 --> 54:32.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in New York. And then I cut
Hendrix and then
Indian Larry.

54:32.669 --> 54:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I cut a piece in Orange County,
New York.
It was for the 75th anniversary
of the Purple

54:34.538 --> 54:36.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heart. And this last piece I
did, which was
Beethoven, it was about a
million square feet.

54:36.406 --> 54:36.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has shagbark hickory trees,
which are loaded
with squirrels. And they have
kind of landed

54:36.974 --> 54:38.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Beethoven's lapel.

54:38.775 --> 54:40.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I pick a field that's going to
be conducive
to the piece. It has to be a
healthy field,

54:40.611 --> 54:42.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a hayfield. I do a scale drawing
in my studio.
I might do four or five
different drawings.

54:42.346 --> 54:43.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we come in and lay out
our image,
and then we cut with smaller
mowers, like

54:43.046 --> 54:44.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
zero turns and just push mowers.

54:44.882 --> 54:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once that's established, we can
come in and
cut the gradations and get the
different levels

54:46.650 --> 54:48.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of grass to reflect light
differently. So,
when you are over top of the
field from 2,000

54:48.485 --> 54:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feet, looking straight down on
it, the areas
that are cut real low will be
lighter. The

54:50.187 --> 54:52.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas that are left tall will be
darker. And
we have gradations in between
those.

54:52.055 --> 54:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the ground, when you look at
it, you can't
tell really anything. It just --
it's so huge.

54:53.924 --> 54:54.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just looks like a bad mowing
job. But when
you get up high, it gets very
representational

54:54.725 --> 54:56.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and becomes an image of
Beethoven.

54:56.660 --> 54:58.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're mowing a lawn. And that's
all I'm doing.
I'm mowing a lawn. And it
brought people together.

54:58.495 --> 55:00.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's really, really
great and it's
very satisfying to see as an
artist to have

55:00.297 --> 55:01.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a piece of artwork that you do
from the soul
and the heart go out there, and
it brings

55:01.999 --> 55:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people together. And I think
that's really
special. That's really special
to me.

55:02.933 --> 55:04.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A different kind
of talent.

55:04.735 --> 55:06.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: A new
law in Massachusetts will make
it illegal

55:06.637 --> 55:08.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for job interviewers to ask
about a potential
hire's salary. On Making Sense,
our job-hunting

55:08.438 --> 55:09.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

should never
disclose what you earn when
you're looking

55:09.907 --> 55:10.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a new job. All that and more
is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.
