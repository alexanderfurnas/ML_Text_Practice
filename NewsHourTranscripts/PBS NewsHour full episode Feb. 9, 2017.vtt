JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS ANCHOR,
NEWSHOUR: Hello.

00:02.502 --> 00:05.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm joined again tonight by
Audie Cornish
of NPR's All Things Considered.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Audie.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH, NPR HOST, ALL
THINGS CONSIDERED:
Thanks, Judy.

00:08.742 --> 00:12.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Our lead story, the
Federal Appeals
Court, based in San Francisco,
has refused

00:12.412 --> 00:15.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reinstate President Trump'’s
immigration
order.

00:15.482 --> 00:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A three-judge panel issued the
unanimous ruling
late today.

00:19.820 --> 00:25.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump called it a
political decision
and he tweeted to say, "See you
in court.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The security of our nation is at
stake."

00:28.161 --> 00:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me to explain the
decision is NEWSHOUR
regular Marcia Coyle of "The
National Law

00:32.399 --> 00:34.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Journal."

00:34.268 --> 00:36.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Marcia, you'’ve had a little
bit of time
to look at this ruling, which
just came down

00:36.937 --> 00:38.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about 45 minutes ago.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you find?

00:40.107 --> 00:41.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, CHIEF WASHINGTON
CORRESPONDENT,
"THE NATIONAL LAW JOURNAL":
Well, first of

00:41.942 --> 00:46.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all, this was what we call a per
curiam opinion,
which means it was an unsigned
opinion and

00:46.046 --> 00:51.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was a unanimous opinion by
the three appellate
judges.

00:51.084 --> 00:57.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government had to show the
panel here
that it had the likelihood of
success on the

00:57.958 --> 01:04.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
merits and also there was a
likelihood of
irreparable harm if this panel
did not put

01:04.898 --> 01:11.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aside the temporary restraining
order that
was blocking the president's
executive order.

01:11.071 --> 01:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The panel said basically that
the government
did not provide evidence to
support either

01:17.411 --> 01:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claim - that it would succeed on
the merits
and that there was irreparable
harm.

01:22.049 --> 01:27.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the likelihood of
irreparable
harm, the government had said
that the seven

01:27.554 --> 01:32.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, for example, that are
targeted
in the order were countries that
had been

01:32.359 --> 01:37.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
designated by prior
administrations and Congress
as being having terrorist
activity.

01:37.764 --> 01:44.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the panel said that there
was no evidence
of strikes here in the country
by those and

01:45.005 --> 01:51.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also that the temporary
restraining order
just restores the status quo
that existed

01:51.912 --> 01:55.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for years before President Trump
issued his
order.

01:55.682 --> 02:00.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then on the merits, the panel
was concerned
about two things, in particular.

02:00.153 --> 02:06.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, it felt that the claims
that the people
who were denied entry to the
country had been

02:06.860 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also denied due process of law;
and by that
we mean, they were not given
notice or a hearing

02:12.966 --> 02:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to determine whether they could
enter the
country.

02:16.303 --> 02:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the panel was particularly
concerned about
legal permanent residents.

02:21.942 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though the White House
counsel had said
the order didn't cover that, the
panel said

02:26.880 --> 02:32.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that wasn't binding and they had
to go on
the basis of the order itself.

02:32.052 --> 02:38.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the panel also found that
there were serious
claims of religious
discrimination.

02:38.158 --> 02:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though those claims are
very early in
terms of judging the merits, the
panel felt

02:43.930 --> 02:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there was enough there for
now that the
temporary restraining order
should stay in

02:48.702 --> 02:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effect and allow the next step
to go forward,
which would've been a full
hearing by the

02:54.041 --> 02:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
federal judge in Seattle.

02:56.043 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And finally, the court looked at
the public
interest here.

02:59.713 --> 03:03.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it said there were aspects
of the public
interest that favored both
sides.

03:03.817 --> 03:09.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One side, the government,
national security;
on the other side, freedom from
discrimination,

03:09.756 --> 03:15.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freedom to do the free flow of
travel, freedom
from separation of families.

03:15.062 --> 03:21.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, that was the basis
basically for the
court to hold that the
government loses.

03:21.134 --> 03:26.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: But, Marcia, again, the
three judges
essentially disagreed with the
government's

03:26.706 --> 03:28.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arguments on its main points.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
COYLE: It did.

03:30.377 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one particularly
crucial point, the
government had argued that this
executive

03:35.348 --> 03:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order was un-reviewable by a
federal court.

03:39.086 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the panel said, on that
point, that that
argument runs contrary to the
fundamental

03:44.858 --> 03:48.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
structure of our constitutional
democracy.

03:48.428 --> 03:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The role of the judiciary, the
panel said,
is to interpret the law and
sometimes that

03:53.633 --> 03:59.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
requires resolving litigation
that challenges
the constitutional authority of
one of the

03:59.840 --> 04:01.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
three branches.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the panel said, it's our
duty to do what
we'’re doing basically.

04:04.711 --> 04:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: As we reported just a
moment ago,
the president has said, '‘see you
in court,'’

04:08.648 --> 04:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's clear the government is
going to appeal
this.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happens next?

04:13.019 --> 04:17.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COYLE: Well, the Department of
Justice said
tonight that it was reviewing
its options.

04:17.157 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can seek full review before
the Ninth Circuit,
all of the judges on the Ninth
Circuit, or

04:23.563 --> 04:30.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it may also go perhaps to the US
Supreme Court
with an emergency request to set
aside the

04:30.170 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
temporary restraining order.

04:32.005 --> 04:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I also should point out
there were many
people who followed the hearing
on Tuesday.

04:37.477 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The panel's decision is on the
Ninth Circuit's
website.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just have to Google Ninth
Circuit and
you'll be able to find it.

04:44.684 --> 04:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORNISH: That is very helpful.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, we'’ll wait to see
what the administration
does.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Marcia Coyle, thank you.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COYLE: My pleasure.

04:51.458 --> 04:56.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, tonight's appeals
court decision
came after President Trump'’s
criticism of

04:56.062 --> 05:00.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the court even as he pushes his
nominee for
the US Supreme Court.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang has that story from
the White House.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

05:04.571 --> 05:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES:
A new era of justice begins and
it begins

05:07.908 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG, GENERAL ASSIGNMENT
CORRESPONDENT,
PBS NEWSHOUR: The man who ran as
the law and

05:11.545 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order candidate made clear today
he'’s now
the law and order president as
Jeff Sessions

05:16.183 --> 05:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was sworn in as President
Trump'’s attorney
general.

05:18.451 --> 05:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: We face the menace of
rising crime
and the threat of deadly terror;
and it's

05:26.826 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not getting better, but it will
get better.

05:29.029 --> 05:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: For days, Mr Trump has
been attacking
the federal judges considering
challenges

05:33.400 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his temporary ban on travel
from seven
mainly Muslim countries.

05:37.304 --> 05:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His Supreme Court nominee, Neil
Gorsuch, told
Connecticut Democratic Senator
Richard Blumenthal

05:42.509 --> 05:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a tweet referring to one of
the jurists
as a so-called judge was
disheartening and

05:48.882 --> 05:50.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
demoralizing.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though a spokesman for
Gorsuch confirmed
the comments, today, the
president insisted

05:53.954 --> 05:54.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
otherwise.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: His comments were
misrepresented.

05:56.823 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you should do is ask
Sen. Blumenthal
about his Vietnam record that
didn'’t exist

06:01.528 --> 06:03.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after years of saying it did.

06:03.363 --> 06:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he misrepresented that, just
like he misrepresented
Judge Gorsuch.

06:08.368 --> 06:13.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: Blumenthal, who was in the
Marine Corps
reserves during the Vietnam War,
but never

06:13.206 --> 06:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
served overseas, apologized in
2010 for saying
during his Senate campaign that
he had served

06:18.979 --> 06:20.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the war.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's comments came in
a bipartisan
meeting that included Democratic
Senators,

06:24.584 --> 06:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he hopes, will vote for Gorsuch.

06:27.087 --> 06:32.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They included four Democrats up
for reelection
next year in states that Mr.
Trump won, like

06:32.225 --> 06:33.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jon Tester of Montana.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON TESTER (D), MONT.: The
president can say
what he wanted about Dick
Blumenthal, but

06:36.663 --> 06:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dick Blumenthal is a quality guy
and a very,
very good senator.

06:39.299 --> 06:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YANG: Does that sort of thing
impact your
decision at all?

06:42.969 --> 06:44.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TESTER: No.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not on this.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not on this at all.

06:47.274 --> 06:53.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we'’re going to take
at the
nominee for what he is and what
his past work

06:53.713 --> 06:55.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we'’ll move forward from
there.

06:55.515 --> 07:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: Meanwhile, senior Trump
advisor Kellyanne
Conway got into hot water today,
when she

07:00.587 --> 07:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed up on the president's
criticism of
Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka
Trump'’s fashion

07:04.224 --> 07:05.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, SENIOR ADVISOR
TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES: I own some
of it.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I fully - I'’m going to just give
it - I'’m
going to give a free commercial
here, and

07:09.429 --> 07:10.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go buy it today everybody.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can find it online.

07:12.599 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: That appeared to run afoul
of ethics
laws against federal employees
endorsing products.

07:17.304 --> 07:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president is exempt under
that law, but
Conway is not.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS
SECRETARY:
Kellyanne has been counseled and
that's all

07:27.547 --> 07:28.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we'’re going go to go with.

07:28.715 --> 07:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been counseled on that
subject and that's
it.

07:33.386 --> 07:38.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: House Oversight Committee
Chairman Jason
Chaffetz said Conway's remarks
were clearly

07:38.925 --> 07:40.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the line and unacceptable.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

07:42.529 --> 07:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: Shortly after the court
decision came
down, a group of reporters ran
into the president

07:47.167 --> 07:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the hallway in the West Wing.

07:49.135 --> 07:53.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told them that he thought the
decision
was political, that he was going
to fight

07:53.206 --> 07:58.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on and that he would eventually
prevail, saying
that the nation'’s security was
at stake.

Judy?

08:00.046 --> 08:03.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: So, John, just
quickly, it'’s clear
this has become an enormous
issue for this

08:03.483 --> 08:04.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YANG: Absolutely.

08:06.286 --> 08:11.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the fact that this is
one of - a
campaign promise, a signature
promise of the

08:11.858 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, one of the first big
executive orders,
challenged in court and you'’ve
seen him

08:16.863 --> 08:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- how important this is, taking
on the judges
personally in tweets and saying
that he's

08:22.302 --> 08:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to fight this to the end,
fight all
the way to the Supreme Court.

08:25.739 --> 08:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNISH: John Yang at the White
House, we
thank you.

08:30.310 --> 08:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day'’s other news, the top
US commander
in Afghanistan said thousands
more troops

08:34.914 --> 08:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are needed to help defeat
Taliban insurgents.

08:38.051 --> 08:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gen. John Nicholson testified
before the Senate
Armed Services Committee, saying
more trainers

08:42.722 --> 08:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and support could help the
Afghan Army break,
what he called, a stalemate.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

JOHN NICHOLSON, COMMANDER OF
RESOLUTE SUPPORT
MISSION AND U.S. FORCES
AFGHANISTAN: I have

08:49.229 --> 08:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adequate resourcing in my
counterterrorism
mission.

08:51.498 --> 08:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my train, advise and assist
mission, however,
we have a shortfall of a few
thousand, and

08:57.504 --> 08:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is in the NATO train,
advise, assist
mission.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this can come from the US
and its allies.

09:02.809 --> 09:07.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: The US still has more

WOODRUFF: A powerful storm
paralyzed cities
across the northeastern US
today, dumping

09:14.587 --> 09:17.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than a foot of snow in some
places.

09:17.290 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scores of accidents, tied up
roads across
the region and the heavy snow
and high winds

09:22.328 --> 09:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forced hundreds of schools to
close from New
York to Boston to Maine.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

stay out of the way of

09:42.749 --> 09:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:54.027 --> 09:55.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is now underway.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That'’s after the US Army Corps

try to stop its completion.

10:08.074 --> 10:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

10:15.548 --> 10:20.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Governor of Alabama
appointed state Attorney
General Luther Strange to the

10:20.086 --> 10:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was sworn in today by Vice
President Pence.

10:23.156 --> 10:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A special election will be held
in 2018 to
fill the seat permanently.

10:28.328 --> 10:32.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Strange replaces Jeff Sessions

10:37.737 --> 10:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones Industrial Average

the S&amp;P 500
added 13.

10:49.649 --> 10:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the NEWSHOUR,
President Trump'’s
continued attacks against
federal judges,

10:54.187 --> 10:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House takes heat for
calling a deadly
raid in Yemen a success, and
Arizonans outraged

10:59.125 --> 11:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over an undocumented mother's
deportation.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All that and much more.

11:04.631 --> 11:18.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: And now, on a
different court question
and that is the mounting
controversy over

11:18.478 --> 11:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump'’s attacks on the
judiciary.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We'’ve just referred to them.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, we turn to two former
judges.

11:25.952 --> 11:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Casale teaches at the
University of Utah
College of Law.

11:29.756 --> 11:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as a federal judge for
five years
in Utah's District Court.

11:34.561 --> 11:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Rebecca Kourlis is a former
justice of
the Colorado Supreme Court.

11:39.465 --> 11:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She now runs the Institute for
the Advancement
of the American Legal System at
the University

11:44.504 --> 11:47.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Denver and we welcome both of
you to the
program.

11:47.373 --> 11:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, I'm talking to
you, Professor
Casale and Justice Kourlis, just
as we've

11:52.412 --> 11:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learned about the - what the
circuit court
in California has ruled, and
that is denying

11:58.484 --> 12:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the administration's appeal.

12:00.987 --> 12:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let me turn to you first,
Justice Kourlis,
what'’s your reaction to what
President Trump

12:06.459 --> 12:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been saying in recent days
about this
circuit court in California?

12:11.698 --> 12:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA KOURLIS, EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR, ADVANCEMENT
OF THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM AT
THE UNIVERSITY

12:14.133 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OF DENVER: Good evening, Judy,
and thanks
for the opportunity to comment
on this.

12:18.972 --> 12:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My concern is not so much the
disagreement
with the outcome, but rather the
attack on

12:26.446 --> 12:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of the legitimacy of the
process.

12:29.616 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that risks further polarity,
further critique
of the judiciary as a political
branch of

12:39.058 --> 12:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government, which it is not,
cannot be, was
never intended to be.

12:44.263 --> 12:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, an attack on the
legal system
is what you're saying and it's -
and you'’re

12:50.670 --> 12:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying it'’s inappropriate, it's
over the
line, I mean, how would you
characterize it?

12:54.974 --> 13:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOURLIS: Well, I mean, I don't
want to sort
of join in the epithet tossing
contest that

13:02.015 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we seem to be in nationally at
present, but
I am a long time former judge,
justice, I

13:09.288 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now study the courts in the
context of IAALS,
the institute at which I work,
and our whole

13:16.529 --> 13:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus is on trying to protect
the independence
and impartiality of the
judiciary, which is

13:23.770 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not to say that I'm an apologist
for judges.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judges make mistakes.

13:29.242 --> 13:33.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judges can approach cases in a
biased way.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are some judges who are
activists.

13:36.616 --> 13:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the point is that the
process itself is
what we count on.

13:41.587 --> 13:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we agree, as a society, that
we will trust
the ultimate outcomes from that
process.

13:49.729 --> 13:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are appeals, there are
ways to approach
things, but, ultimately, it's
about the balance

13:56.235 --> 13:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of powers and the legitimacy of
the court.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Prof. Casale, how do
you see it
what the president has been
saying about the

14:02.809 --> 14:03.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
court?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Very critical remarks.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL CASALE, PROFESSOR,
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH
COLLEGE OF LAW: Well, I think
he'’s been

14:07.346 --> 14:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very critical of the court, but
then again
the court has been striking down
or at least

14:10.183 --> 14:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staying one of the signature
pieces of his
campaign, the immigration
reform, and we have

14:15.922 --> 14:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long tradition of three
co-equal branches
of government - co-equal
branches of government

14:20.960 --> 14:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have often felt free to
criticize what
the others are doing.

14:25.832 --> 14:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can go all the way back to
Abraham Lincoln,
who very famously even refused
to follow some

14:30.770 --> 14:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
edicts from the US Supreme
Court.

14:32.705 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I see the dialogue as, in
some ways, being
healthy, although I would hope
that the discourse

14:37.310 --> 14:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could be elevated at least above
some of the
things that have recently been
said.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Justice Kourlis, why
isn't it just
healthy dialogue?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it does go back.

14:47.186 --> 14:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we think about what
other presidents
have done and said about the
court.

14:50.423 --> 14:55.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KOURLIS: So, here'’s sort of the
bottom line
for me, Judy.

14:55.962 --> 15:04.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not OK to criticize a judge
as illegitimate
or activist just because you
disagree with

15:04.804 --> 15:06.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the outcome.

15:06.572 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's fine to say I think that's
the wrong
ruling, I disagree with the
basis upon which

15:12.011 --> 15:18.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ruling is issued, but to
sort of claim
that the judge has no right to
issue that

15:18.251 --> 15:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ruling, that to me crosses the
line.

15:21.487 --> 15:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And Prof. Kourlis,
when President
Trump called Judge Robart a
so-called judge

15:29.061 --> 15:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then he went on to talk
about - I think
he used the word disgraceful -
the way the

15:34.934 --> 15:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judges conducted themselves or
some of the
judges conducted themselves at
the appellate

15:39.405 --> 15:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing on Tuesday of this week,
is that not
stepping over the line?

15:47.146 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that calling into question
the very role
that judges play?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KOURLIS: It is, to me.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: I'm sorry.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I meant that for Prof. Casale.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KOURLIS: Sorry.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CASALE: Well, I think he's
stepping over a
line of decorum, but I'’m not
sure that he'’s

16:01.360 --> 16:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stepping over some line that
invalidates the
separation of powers.

16:04.997 --> 16:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, President Trump has made
it one of
his signature, I guess, style
points, you

16:09.702 --> 16:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could say, that he's going to be
very plainspoken,
and so it's not surprising to
find he'’s

16:14.407 --> 16:16.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
using strong language to
criticize the judges.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't be using that same
language.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's a violation of our
rules of civility.

16:21.614 --> 16:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the things that
President Trump
has indicated is that he'’s going
to press

16:25.551 --> 16:29.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of those boundaries and
he's going to
use new forms of communication,
like Twitter,

16:29.722 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that probably prevents some of
the nuance
or maybe even some of the
elegance that we've

16:33.492 --> 16:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seen from previous presidents.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, Justice Kourlis,
what about
that?

16:37.196 --> 16:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it can be argued that
this president
is taking advantage of new
methods of communication,

16:42.368 --> 16:44.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
including Twitter.

16:44.136 --> 16:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOURLIS: I'’m OK with that
actually and I'm
OK with plain talk and an effort
to pierce

16:50.209 --> 16:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through some of the complexities
of the legal
system because I certainly don't
think it's

16:56.582 --> 16:58.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OK to hide behind that.

16:58.718 --> 17:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But my point fundamentally is
that judges
have a role.

17:03.990 --> 17:10.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their role is to determine the
facts in front
of them at the trial court
level, apply the

17:10.429 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, rule, and then the parties
can appeal
it as far up the process as
possible.

17:16.636 --> 17:25.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the whole process is
perceived to be political,
if judges are perceived to rule
on the basis

17:25.077 --> 17:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of who appointed them or what
political party
they have, then impartiality
goes out the

17:32.551 --> 17:34.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
window.

17:34.420 --> 17:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people in positions of
power, people in
leadership positions, I hold to
a higher standard

17:41.460 --> 17:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of acknowledging the balance of
powers, the
role of each branch of
government.

17:47.733 --> 17:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And by the way, I would apply
this evenhandedly.

17:51.370 --> 17:56.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don'’t think it's OK to call
President
Trump a so-called president.

17:56.876 --> 18:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a legitimacy of process
that we all
honor and that's part of
democracy.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What about the point
she's making,
Prof. Casale?

18:05.518 --> 18:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CASALE: Well, President Trump I
think has
recognized the legitimacy of the
process.

18:09.555 --> 18:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'’s appealed to the Ninth
Circuit and I'm
assuming he's going to ask the
Justice Department

18:14.226 --> 18:18.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to appeal to the Supreme Court
now to have
the decision overturned.

18:18.497 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's unfair to take
certain labels
off the table as inappropriate.

18:23.803 --> 18:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a healthy debate in
this country
about whether our judiciary, and
particularly

18:27.974 --> 18:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our federal judiciary, is too
activist - that
is, it is making laws rather
than applying

18:32.812 --> 18:34.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
laws.

18:34.647 --> 18:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can have that debate in
the dry language
of law professors or you can
have that debate

18:39.352 --> 18:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the more robust language of
Twitter feeds
and plainspoken talk.

18:43.589 --> 18:48.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think President Trump is
trying to have
that debate in a way that
average Americans

18:48.828 --> 18:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can understand and communicate
effectively
in that way.

18:51.664 --> 18:55.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, I wouldn't speak in those
ways, but
I think he'’s certainly entitled
to speak

18:55.468 --> 18:57.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in those ways.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, I just want to
come back to
you quickly, Prof. Casale, and
read to you

18:58.871 --> 19:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what President Trump said in one
of his remarks.

19:02.475 --> 19:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said this judge opens up our
country to
potential terrorists.

19:06.212 --> 19:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said if something happens,
blame him and
the court system.

19:10.349 --> 19:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think that's within the
bounds of what
a president can say.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CASALE: Yes, absolutely.

19:15.721 --> 19:19.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what's at stake in this
immigration
debate is a debate about whether
we are effectively

19:19.859 --> 19:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protecting our country from
terrorism.

19:21.827 --> 19:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, to the point to the
consequences of
an adverse ruling is exactly
what the government

19:27.199 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawyers are doing out in the
Ninth Circuit
and I assume will be doing soon
to the Supreme

19:31.203 --> 19:33.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

19:33.105 --> 19:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And we do expect - we
have every
reason to assume the White House
- the administration

19:36.042 --> 19:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will continue to challenge and
to appeal that
decision.

19:41.113 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we want to thank both of
you, Prof.
Paul Casale, Justice Rebecca
Kourlis, we appreciate

19:46.519 --> 19:47.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your joining us.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

19:48.821 --> 19:53.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CASALE: Thank you.

19:53.359 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KOURLIS: Thank you, Judy.

19:59.398 --> 20:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: There are lingering
questions over
the deadly raid by US Navy SEALs
in Yemen

20:04.703 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last month.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While it's still unclear exactly
what happened
on the ground, the question of
whether the

20:09.742 --> 20:12.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raid should be seen as a success
has become
a political one.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

20:14.814 --> 20:19.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CORNISH: Eight days ago,
President Trump flew
to Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware to honor

20:19.418 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a Navy SEAL killed in Yemen.

20:21.220 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The US also lost an Osprey
aircraft in the
January 29 raid on Al Qaeda.

20:26.492 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, despite these losses, the
White House
called the operation a success.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But critics like Republican Sen.
John McCain
disagreed.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZ.: When you
lose a $75
million airplane and, more
importantly, an

20:37.636 --> 20:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American life is lost and
wounded, I don't
believe that you can call it a
success.

20:42.675 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: The president fired
back this morning,
tweeting that it only emboldens
the enemy

20:47.947 --> 20:50.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to discuss the raid with
reporters.

20:50.216 --> 20:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said of McCain, "he's been
losing so long,
he doesn't know how to win
anymore."

20:54.320 --> 20:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, McCain's daughter
defended her
former prisoner-of-war father on
Twitter,

20:59.725 --> 21:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying "Trump has never served.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My father can't bend one of his
knees or lift
one of his arms above his head.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am done with this today.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Done."

21:09.802 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House spokesman Sean
Spicer argued Wednesday
that the SEALs gathered critical
intelligence.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SPICER: It'’s absolutely a
success.

21:14.840 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think anyone who would
suggest it'’s
not a success does disservice to
the life

21:19.078 --> 21:20.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Chief Ryan Owens.

21:20.579 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNISH: The raid also killed
civilians, including
women and children.

21:23.549 --> 21:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The New York Times" reported
this week that
Yemen has now withdrawn
permission for such

21:28.821 --> 21:30.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
operations.

21:30.489 --> 21:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yemen's foreign minister denied
that, but
said they are seeking a
reassessment.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

21:35.427 --> 21:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: We break down what we
know of the
raid now with Nancy Youssef,
national security

21:39.198 --> 21:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
correspondent at Buzzfeed News.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to the program.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY YOUSSEF, NATIONAL SECURITY
CORRESPONDENT,
BUZZFEED NEWS: Thanks for having
me.

21:44.603 --> 21:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: Now, with the tweets
from the White
House, Congress, this has really
become a

21:47.506 --> 21:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of political football.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are people saying inside
the Pentagon?

21:51.777 --> 21:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOUSSEF: Well, it'’s frankly made
it hard
for people in the Pentagon to
talk about this,

21:55.915 --> 21:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, because what they see as
a military
operation has now evolved into a
political

21:59.785 --> 22:01.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inherently, they don't talk
about special
operations raid.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They'’re covert.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you have everything being
put in this
political context, trying to
answer the question

22:08.561 --> 22:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what is success on a US
military operation.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John McCain has called it a
failure.

22:14.366 --> 22:19.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the White House was
saying success
was a delicate term because
civilians and

22:19.738 --> 22:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chief Owens had been killed in
the raid.

22:22.841 --> 22:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this week, they said it was
categorically
a success.

22:26.378 --> 22:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, inside - rather than a
discussion about
success or failure, there's a
real measure

22:30.516 --> 22:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on about the risks and
rewards of this
raid and was it worth given how
tumultuous

22:38.224 --> 22:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was that it evolved into a
firefight and
that you now have questions
swirling around

22:43.929 --> 22:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it - was this worth - was the
intelligence
gathered worth all that was -
that'’s come

22:51.503 --> 22:53.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of it since?

22:53.439 --> 22:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: I think this has also
sparked a greater
conversation about the process
and the thinking

22:58.377 --> 23:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that goes into green lighting a
raid like
this, right, and also comparing
it to the

23:03.749 --> 23:05.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama administration.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Talk a little bit about that.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we know about what happened
in terms
of that process?

23:09.321 --> 23:12.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
YOUSSEF: So, the Obama
administration was
really risk-averse.

23:12.691 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Trump during the
campaign really
campaigned on the idea of being
more aggressive

23:17.029 --> 23:21.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in terms of going after
extremist elements
like Al Qaeda, which was the
target of this

23:21.867 --> 23:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raid, and the Islamic State.

23:23.769 --> 23:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, we've heard that the
Obama administration
was aware of the raid and the
planning for

23:29.108 --> 23:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, which was months before it
actually happened,
but that they had decided
essentially that

23:34.380 --> 23:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was not a decision for them
to make,
that while it had reached to the
National

23:38.250 --> 23:40.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security Council, it hadn'’t
reached the
president.

23:40.786 --> 23:45.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because the military wanted
to launch
this raid on the first lunar
moon, which was

23:45.124 --> 23:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on January 29, nine days after
the raid, the
decision was formally made by
President Trump.

23:51.964 --> 23:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the question that people
are having
is what does the process tell us
about how

23:56.802 --> 24:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump will make
decisions on these
raids and how much does that
differ from the

24:01.407 --> 24:03.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama administration.

24:03.208 --> 24:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And is this more aggressive
approach, how
is it going to manifest in more
risky raids,

24:10.282 --> 24:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more risky operations than we
have seen in
the past eight years under the
Obama administration,

24:15.220 --> 24:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which really was willing to even
endorse some
risks of terror groups being
allowed to sustain

24:20.993 --> 24:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rather than take the risk of
doing operations
like this, dropping boots on the
ground in

24:27.433 --> 24:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a combat zone, like war-torn
Yemen.

24:30.436 --> 24:34.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNISH: As you mentioned, Yemen
has been
in freefall for many years now.

24:34.940 --> 24:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we seeing a renewed focus by
the US on
this country and do we have any
sense about

24:40.879 --> 24:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what that could mean going
forward?

24:42.715 --> 24:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOUSSEF: Well, remember, in the
early hours
of the Trump administration,
they conducted

24:46.985 --> 24:48.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drone strikes in Yemen.

24:48.754 --> 24:53.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we had started to hear talk
that while
the focus has been on ISIS for
the past few

24:53.525 --> 24:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, Al Qaeda in the Arab
Peninsula has
been one of the few groups that
has been able

24:57.029 --> 25:00.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to execute external attacks on
Western allies.

25:00.432 --> 25:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, they were part of the
planning for
the Charlie Hebdo attack in
Paris, France,

25:05.270 --> 25:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so there has been a feeling
that perhaps
this administration would want
to expand its

25:10.376 --> 25:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counterterrorism operations to
not just focus
on ISIS, but focus on a group,
like Al Qaeda,

25:15.214 --> 25:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has really been able to
flourish in the
last five years of the Yemeni
Civil War because

25:21.553 --> 25:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there'’s so much ungoverned space
and such
a fertile ground for them to
recruit and train.

25:27.192 --> 25:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNISH: Nancy Youssef is
national security
correspondent for Buzzfeed.

25:31.463 --> 25:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you so much for speaking
with us.

25:34.833 --> 25:42.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YOUSSEF: Thank you.

25:42.174 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:45.444 --> 25:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the NEWSHOUR,
companies in a
delicate dance with a
businessman as president.

25:51.083 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the ideology White House
Chief Strategist
Steve Bannon portrayed in his
films.

25:56.555 --> 26:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, how one woman'’s
story has sparked
protests in Arizona.

26:02.094 --> 26:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a
mother of two,
has lived in the US illegally
for more than

26:07.499 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two decades.

26:09.201 --> 26:13.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was arrested Wednesday after
her regular
check in with immigration
officials.

26:13.705 --> 26:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dozens of protesters rallied
overnight in
Phoenix as activists blocked off
entrances

26:18.811 --> 26:25.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Federal Immigration and
Customs Enforcement
building and a van carrying
Garcia de Rayos.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was deported today.

26:27.219 --> 26:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier I spoke with Daniel
González of "The
Arizona Republic" newspaper.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Daniel González, thank you very
much for
talking with us.

26:34.960 --> 26:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Ms. Garcia de Rayos had been
checking
in regularly with immigration
officials, was

26:40.499 --> 26:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not deported, what was different
about this
time?

26:43.035 --> 26:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GONZAÁLEZ, IMMIGRATION
REPORTER, THE
ARIZONA REPUBLIC: Well, what her
lawyer and

26:46.505 --> 26:50.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activists are alleging is that -
what was
different was the executive
order that President

26:50.843 --> 26:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump signed on January 25.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This greatly expands the
priorities that ICE
is given for deportations and it
basically

26:58.851 --> 27:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sends a message to ICE that they
want to - that
the Trump administration would
like to see

27:03.555 --> 27:11.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a much broader scope of
deportations, and
so the feeling is - is that
under the Obama

27:11.430 --> 27:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, she was allowed
to check in,
she was allowed to remain in the
United States,

27:14.533 --> 27:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was allowed to remain with
her family,
but when she went in to check in
yesterday,

27:20.105 --> 27:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was taken into custody and
then quickly
deported to Mexico.

27:23.609 --> 27:27.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And we know there was
a felony on
her record.

27:27.279 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had to do with a 2008 raid at
her workplace
conducted under then Sheriff Joe
Arpaio.

27:35.821 --> 27:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was found to have had
inaccurate identification
and there was a felony
conviction, but again

27:45.497 --> 27:50.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
under the previous
administration that was
not considered enough to deport
her.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GONZAÁLEZ: Right.

27:52.170 --> 27:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, what happened was,
she was working
with a fake Social Security
number.

27:57.109 --> 28:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sheriff Arpaio was conducting
these massive
worksite raids back in 2008.

28:03.315 --> 28:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When his deputies conducted this
raid, they
seized a lot of the I-9 forms.

28:08.921 --> 28:15.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are the government
employment records
and that led her to - that led
sheriff deputies

28:15.460 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Ms. Garcia de Rayos.

28:19.531 --> 28:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went to her house, they
arrested her,
she ended up pleading guilty to
a felony charge

28:24.703 --> 28:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then she was turned over to
ICE custody.

28:27.372 --> 28:36.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She spent some time in a
detention facility
and then ICE decided that she
was not considered

28:36.048 --> 28:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a high priority, most likely
because of her
long ties to the United States,
her two US

28:41.887 --> 28:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citizen born children, her two
decades here.

28:45.390 --> 28:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, what she was basically
doing was every
year checking with ICE and then
they would

28:49.895 --> 28:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
renew this supervised release.

28:52.998 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And she argued she was
14 years
old when she came to the United
States.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is now 22 years later.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's 36.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has two children.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has a husband.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do people believe is going
to happen
to her now?

29:08.480 --> 29:09.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is her recourse?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GONZAÁLEZ: Well, she'’s in
Nogales.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She'’s staying in a shelter
there.

29:14.052 --> 29:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her family is driving down today
to bring
her some clothes.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She really didn't have anything
when she went
down there.

29:19.825 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as far as I know, she really
has no legal
recourse.

29:23.061 --> 29:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She could spend - she could be
permanently
barred from coming back to the
United States.

29:29.034 --> 29:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some provisions that
allow you to
apply for hardship waivers, but
usually you

29:34.339 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to remain out of the
country for 10 years.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's really unclear whether
she would
even qualify for that.

29:40.145 --> 29:45.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once somebody has been removed
from the country,
it's very, very difficult to
ever come back.

29:45.984 --> 29:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Daniel González,
reporter for "The
Arizona Republic", and we expect
there to

29:50.255 --> 29:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a number of other stories
like this one.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

29:55.861 --> 30:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GONZAÁLEZ: You're welcome.

30:04.569 --> 30:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORNISH: It has become a routine
question.

30:09.741 --> 30:14.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What kind of separation is there
between the
president, his family and the
promotion of

30:14.746 --> 30:16.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their businesses?

30:16.615 --> 30:21.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway's comments
today about Ivanka
Trump fueled a new round of
criticism and

30:21.486 --> 30:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerns for the companies
involved.

30:23.555 --> 30:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how should businesses
navigate these new
waters?

30:27.592 --> 30:31.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,

PAUL SOLMAN, PBS BUSINESS AND

The Super Bowl politicized this
year through

30:38.770 --> 30:39.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ads.

30:39.971 --> 30:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Airbnb branding itself as
immigration friendly.

30:46.645 --> 30:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coca-Cola, recycling a 2014 ad,
that also
suggests an alternative
definition of American

30:53.418 --> 30:55.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patriotism.

30:55.253 --> 31:03.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in the larger world,
backlash from Uber
customers over President Trump'’s
immigration

31:03.528 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

forced its
CEO to step down from a White
House advisory

31:10.836 --> 31:12.604 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

31:12.637 --> 31:17.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nordstrom dropping the first

a tweet from
President Trump yesterday, "My
daughter has

31:23.381 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been treated so unfairly by
Nordstrom.

31:26.284 --> 31:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a great person, always
pushing me to
do the right thing.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Terrible!"

(END VIDEO CLIP)

31:33.291 --> 31:38.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: So, are we seeing the
rise of a new
partisan consumerism, echoing
the country'’s

31:38.163 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
polarized politics?

31:40.232 --> 31:44.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We invited two Harvard Business
School professors,
Nancy Koehn and Len Schlesinger,
to answer

31:44.870 --> 31:46.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the question.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY KOEHN, JAMES E. ROBISON
PROFESSOR OF
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, HARVARD
BUSINESS

31:48.373 --> 31:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCHOOL: What we're seeing now
is, I think,
the culmination or perhaps the
next logical

31:52.110 --> 32:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step of a long series of events
and trends
among consumers, many of them
previously alienated

32:00.585 --> 32:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the political process,
where they use
their dollars to vote on social,
economic

32:04.823 --> 32:06.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and political issues.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARD SCHLESINGER, BAKER
FOUNDATION PROFESSOR,
HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL: And
relative to today's

32:08.660 --> 32:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, there are
countless examples
of how that'’s being played out
on a daily

32:11.163 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
basis.

32:13.098 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have the scenario of the
Ivanka merchandising
line, which has now been
essentially removed

32:19.404 --> 32:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Nordstrom and Neiman
Marcus.

32:23.208 --> 32:30.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A #boycottnordstrom
#boycottneimanmarcus for
actually tossing our Ivanka out
of the store

32:30.615 --> 32:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the same on the other side
of the equation.

32:33.418 --> 32:41.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: So, boycotts - consumer
boycotts
have been used to express
political beliefs

32:41.059 --> 32:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to try to affect political
outcomes for
-

32:43.461 --> 32:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOEHN: - for at least 50 or 60
years, right,
and probably going back farther
than that.

32:47.833 --> 32:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What, again, is new, I think,
Paul, is the
reach and the speed, and that's
all running

32:55.273 --> 32:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the high-octane fuel of
social media.

32:58.643 --> 33:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the other thing
that'’s new and
different is the emotional
energy that social

33:03.315 --> 33:04.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
media allows.

33:05.016 --> 33:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are all businesses that
have a very
big word-of-mouth component to
them.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a big ego or identity
component
to them.

33:12.557 --> 33:18.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the ability of these
boycotts to affect
those aspects of business
success, consumer

33:18.597 --> 33:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loyalty, word-of-mouth, brand
power, that'’s
a big deal.

33:22.467 --> 33:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCHLESINGER: And the interesting
thing here
is seeing where it really is a
big deal and

33:26.304 --> 33:27.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where it isn'’t.

33:28.006 --> 33:33.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the context of Uber, it
is a service
that people hate to love or love
to hate,

33:33.712 --> 33:35.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

33:35.447 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the CEO announces he's going
to join the
president'’s Business Advisory
Council.

33:41.119 --> 33:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the midst of everything that
was going
on at Uber and everything that
was going on

33:46.391 --> 33:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the administration within the
immigrant
community, he had no choice but
to withdraw

33:53.098 --> 33:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from being on the president'’s
Advisory Council.

33:55.800 --> 33:59.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You wonder what got them
possessed to actually
join in the first place.

33:59.037 --> 34:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Because he ought to have
anticipated
the uproar that that might
cause.

34:03.475 --> 34:08.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCHLESINGER: Given the
populations that he'’s
serving and the populations,
quite honestly,

34:08.713 --> 34:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Uber service is having
a huge negative
impact on, it should have been
obvious.

34:13.952 --> 34:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOEHN: I would ask or would want
business
leaders to have the same kind of
consciousness

34:19.190 --> 34:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the divisiveness, about
the electorate,
about the different kinds of
issues that were,

34:26.164 --> 34:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you will, uncovered, again,
in very emotionally
intense ways during the
campaign.

34:31.403 --> 34:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it'’s by no means stay away,
it's let'’s
think this through very
carefully as we think

34:36.808 --> 34:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how to respond, react,
predict.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: But aren't you saying
stay away?

34:40.745 --> 34:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCHLESINGER: It'’s precisely
those terms
that give me pause, OK, and have
me advising

34:44.950 --> 34:51.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in more situations than not for
CEOs, after
doing their balance sheet, to
actually lay

34:51.957 --> 34:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
low until there's a bit more
certainty as
to how the administration truly
is going to

34:56.995 --> 34:58.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
govern going forward.

34:58.863 --> 35:06.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Are we seeing what's
been called identity
politics playing out now across
the board?

35:06.504 --> 35:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOEHN: Think about how people
that are on
the boycott Trump businesses
side of things

35:12.043 --> 35:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are thinking of themselves - so,
thinking
of themselves, first, as I don't
support the

35:17.182 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president; secondly, I want to
make a difference
here in voicing and in doing
something with

35:23.822 --> 35:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my opposition, my resistance.

35:25.690 --> 35:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that is, in some ways, an
exercise in
identity.

35:29.728 --> 35:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, interestingly, when we
talked on the campaign
about identity politics, we
talked about it

35:34.899 --> 35:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
often on the side of Trump
supporters.

35:37.135 --> 35:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not sure of my identity,
I'm not sure
where I belong in this country,
I'm not sure

35:41.940 --> 35:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that people in Washington
understand or are
acting on my behalf.

35:45.010 --> 35:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Because candidate Trump
embodied their
sense of identity, sort of
counter to the

35:54.152 --> 35:55.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mainstream.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KOEHN: Absolutely.

35:57.155 --> 36:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if we'’re not going to
see a kind
of consumer activism, identity
politics, potentially

36:05.697 --> 36:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a cohesion of the resistance or
the opposition
to Mr. Trump that actually has
to do with

36:10.969 --> 36:14.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an emerging patriotism.

36:14.205 --> 36:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A huge amount of the resistance,
when you
dig down deep in, is about the
integrity of

36:21.513 --> 36:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump'’s actions with relation to
the constitution
or fundamental American values.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: That might've manifest
itself in terms
of consumption.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCHLESINGER: Well, at the first
level, as
you see it play out just this
weekend at the

36:32.257 --> 36:34.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Super Bowl, OK?

36:34.059 --> 36:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm fascinated by listening
to all of
the responses to the Lady Gaga
halftime show.

36:39.397 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is she started
singing God
Bless America and she had a
whole portrayal

36:45.970 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of, what I will call, incredibly
patriotic
songs by someone who would not
be naturally

36:53.011 --> 36:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assumed to be among the great
patriots.

36:55.713 --> 37:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reality is it's exactly,
I think,
what you're talking about,
Nancy.

37:00.051 --> 37:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, the Anheuser-Busch
commercial
celebrating the arrival of
August Busch, the

37:07.158 --> 37:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airbnb commercial celebrating
the diversity
in the American population
without ever talking

37:12.397 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about what Airbnb is or what
Airbnb does.

37:14.866 --> 37:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: I literally did not know
that that
was an Airbnb commercial.

37:18.536 --> 37:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHLESINGER: Yes, yes, yes.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KOEHN: Think about that.

37:21.506 --> 37:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think tactically from a
marketing perspective,
it's not - we'’re not talking
about what

37:24.442 --> 37:31.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airbnb is, but we'’re talking
about the values
of the Airbnb brand or the
values of Anheuser-Busch

37:31.950 --> 37:33.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ad.

37:33.718 --> 37:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It'’s a little bit like Nike
Towns where
we make these investments in our
brand that

37:38.456 --> 37:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may or may not translate quickly
into profitability
or feed the bottom line, and yet
they'’re

37:44.229 --> 37:49.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long-term investments in how we
want our consumers
to understand who we are.

37:49.167 --> 37:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And your point about the
Airbnb ad
being like Nike, I mean, Nike is
all about

37:59.878 --> 38:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
image and identity, and not
function, right?

38:02.347 --> 38:04.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KOEHN: Just do it.

38:04.315 --> 38:05.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Right, absolutely.

38:05.717 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it'’s been - viewed from the
long term
- remarkably successful.

38:10.555 --> 38:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Do you think there will
be a group
of companies now or even a group
of products

38:16.561 --> 38:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or services that actually embody
the oppositional
form?

38:21.533 --> 38:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don'’t know how to quite put
this, the
oppositional form of American
patriotism.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And if so, what would they be?

38:28.106 --> 38:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCHLESINGER: Well, I think we
saw some of
it this weekend as we saw some
of the more

38:31.342 --> 38:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subtle messaging that came out
of the commercials,
which was, we'’re about all
Americans, we'’re

38:36.414 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about being open to everybody,
we'’re about
being absolutely clear that we
welcome all

38:43.087 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to our country and to our
businesses.

38:45.623 --> 38:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: So, last question, do
you guys imagine
that, four years from now, we
will have a

38:55.633 --> 39:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country that's as divided in
terms of what
it shops for as who it votes
for?

39:02.140 --> 39:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCHLESINGER: If I extrapolated
from the trends
of the last several months, I
would say yes,

39:10.515 --> 39:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that requires me to actually
predict that
what we'’re experiencing today
continues

39:15.620 --> 39:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, in fact, gets exaggerated
over the next
four years.

39:18.656 --> 39:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I, as an academic, can say
that'’d be really
interesting; as a human being,
I'’d say that's

39:24.362 --> 39:26.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scary.

39:26.164 --> 39:29.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: From the Harvard
Business School in

39:52.724 --> 39:53.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

39:55.627 --> 39:57.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN, SENIOR
CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:
He is chief strategist to
President Trump.

39:57.562 --> 40:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Close at hand as policy is made
and decisions
come from the White House.

40:01.966 --> 40:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president even recently
appointing him
to a seat on the National
Security Council,

40:06.671 --> 40:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a controversial decision.

40:08.840 --> 40:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stephen Bannon has quickly
gained so much
of a reputation as an
influential behind-the-scenes

40:13.611 --> 40:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
string puller that Saturday

ALEC BALDWIN, ACTOR: Send in
Steve Bannon.

40:23.488 --> 40:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Bannon was well known
previously as
Chairman of Breitbart News, the
right-wing

40:28.559 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news organization that Bannon
himself once
called the platform of the
Alt-Right, a fringe

40:34.365 --> 40:39.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservative group that mixes
populism, white
nationalism and racism.

40:39.504 --> 40:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's also worked extensively
in the film
world as executive producer on
two traditional

40:44.475 --> 40:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dramas, including the "Indian
Runner" - Sean
Penn's directorial debut - and
as producer,

40:50.715 --> 40:59.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writer and director of political
documentaries,
often released during election
cycles.

40:59.557 --> 41:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among his film topics, the
global financial
crisis in 2010'’s "Generation
Zero."

41:05.863 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

41:10.601 --> 41:17.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More recently, 2016's "Clinton

alleged corruption in the
Clinton Foundation.

41:17.308 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And also, last year,
"Torchbearer" about an
America turning from God and the

Bannon's films

41:29.520 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

41:38.996 --> 41:40.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both you.

41:40.665 --> 41:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ann, give us first an overview
of themes,
style, approach that emerge when
you look

41:45.370 --> 41:47.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the films.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY, FILM CRITIC, "THE
WASHINGTON
POST": Well, Bannon has really
come into his

41:48.106 --> 41:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own as mostly a documentary
maker.

41:50.108 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has made and produced fiction
films in
the past, but it'’s really his
documentaries

41:54.812 --> 41:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that get the most attention.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And often, they have political
themes.

41:59.450 --> 42:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a few sort of canards and
villains
that he returns to.

42:05.790 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't like the Clintons
very much.

42:08.493 --> 42:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't like any political
elites very
much.

42:11.929 --> 42:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He rails against the sort of
permanent political
class.

42:15.800 --> 42:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sees - the films often depict
the world
in very Manichaean terms,
apocalyptic terms.

42:21.472 --> 42:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Manichean, black and
white -

42:23.341 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HORNADAY: Black and white, very
urgent, very
dramatic, I would say very
hyperbolic in terms

42:28.746 --> 42:31.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this fight between good and
evil.

42:31.516 --> 42:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've described it once as sort
of clash of
civilizations as cage match.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And lately, that has really
centered around
this, what he calls, the
Judeo-Christian West

42:41.392 --> 42:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what he sees as radical
Islamic jihadism.

42:43.661 --> 42:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Matea Gold, he has
referred to the
work as weaponizing film.

42:48.866 --> 42:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said we'’ve tried to weaponize
film and
we'’ve tried to do it in a
certain way to

42:52.437 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get this film to people who
might not necessarily
see a political documentary.

42:56.474 --> 42:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he'’s very up front in this
work as at
Breitbart.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, NATIONAL POLITICAL
REPORTER, THE
WASHINGTON POST: Right.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing that I think is very
important to
understand about Bannon is that
he'’s a very

43:03.915 --> 43:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
canny practitioner of whatever
medium that
he'’s engaged with.

43:08.152 --> 43:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has spoken admiringly about
the techniques
of both Leni Riefenstahl, the
Nazi propagandist,

43:13.491 --> 43:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Michael Moore, the liberal
filmmaker.

43:16.227 --> 43:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we've seen over the
course of his
films is that he explored a lot
of the themes,

43:20.765 --> 43:26.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nationalist and populist
themes, that
really then echoed in Donald
Trump's campaign.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He did a documentary about
illegal immigration.

43:28.539 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went through a whole film
that examined
the fall out of the financial
crisis.

43:33.878 --> 43:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw him elevating figures
such as Sarah
Palin in his films.

43:37.482 --> 43:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we really saw him wrestling
with some
of these same issues that later
came to bear

43:42.119 --> 43:43.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his politics.

43:43.921 --> 43:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Let's take a look at a
short clip from
the Torchbearer, which is from
last year.

43:47.124 --> 43:51.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is featuring Phil
Robertson, who is best
known for the Duck Dynasty
series, and the

43:51.162 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
theme of defending Christianity
and the rise
of violent Islam.

43:55.032 --> 43:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here'’s a short clip.

43:56.033 --> 43:57.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

43:57.768 --> 44:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the
absence of God,
the man with the biggest stick
determines

44:00.771 --> 44:02.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your worth.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Caesar demands his pinch of
incense.

44:05.076 --> 44:10.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Violence, decadence, political
anarchy, moral
decay.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the City of Man.

44:13.251 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"When he opened the fourth seal,
I heard the
voice of the fourth living
creature saying,

44:19.156 --> 44:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come and see these events, more
to come.

44:23.794 --> 44:31.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I looked and behold a pale
horse, and
the name of him who sat on it
was death, and

44:31.369 --> 44:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hades followed with him."

44:33.037 --> 44:34.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

44:34.839 --> 44:37.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Now, Ann, there'’s a lot
more graphic
imagery that we weren'’t able to
show.

44:37.408 --> 44:39.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot of it is fast-paced
and louder.

44:39.744 --> 44:41.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

44:41.612 --> 44:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HORNADAY: He definitely has
perfected this
rhetoric that'’s very - again,
very hyperbolic,

44:45.917 --> 44:47.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very stylized.

44:47.118 --> 44:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He'’s an emotional storyteller.

44:49.387 --> 44:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there are many ways to
make a documentary.

44:52.390 --> 44:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some documentaries are
explanatory.

44:54.258 --> 45:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they try to make a case in
terms of rationality
and data and evidence-based
learning.

45:00.598 --> 45:03.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he'’s very much a guy who
goes for the
jugular.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It'’s very emotional, very
emotionalistic.

45:05.836 --> 45:11.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Matea said, you can
really see the
echoes of that rhetoric style,
that rhetorical

45:11.509 --> 45:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
style, not only in Trump'’s
rhetoric, but
just even the behavior in the
first couple

45:15.913 --> 45:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of weeks in terms of the way
that they have
approached, you know, say the
immigration

45:22.653 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy that they unfurled really
without a
whole lot of process involved in
terms of

45:27.525 --> 45:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making sure you get buy-in from
agencies and
legislators, because I think,
you know, that

45:32.997 --> 45:37.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of hews to the same sort of
principle
of make a big splash and appeal
to that emotional

45:37.902 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
core.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Matea, you got a look at
an outline
for a proposed film that never
got made, right,

45:42.974 --> 45:44.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but written by Stephen Bannon.

45:44.909 --> 45:50.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was to be called
Destroying the Great
Satan: The Rise of Islamic
Fascism in America.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

45:52.249 --> 45:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOLD: This was an outline of a
film that he
worked on in 2007 that explored
a lot of aspects

45:57.822 --> 46:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of not only the potential of
radical Muslims
to inflict attacks here in the
United States,

46:04.462 --> 46:10.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the potential for Muslim
organizations,
community groups to be serving
as front groups.

46:10.801 --> 46:17.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also would have explored
the sort of
appeasement, as he put it, of
enablers such

46:17.308 --> 46:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the media, the universities,
the American
Jewish community, that the
outline argued

46:22.413 --> 46:26.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were actually facilitating the
rise of some
of these radical elements.

46:26.951 --> 46:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this treatment gives us sort
of a window
into how concerned and
preoccupied, I think,

46:32.056 --> 46:38.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bannon has been with the
potential of fundamental
Islam here threatening the
United States.

46:38.229 --> 46:41.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: It uses phases like
fundamental clash
of civilization, right?

46:41.732 --> 46:43.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GOLD: Exactly.

46:43.067 --> 46:45.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There'’s a sense - and you've
heard him
speak about this.

46:45.503 --> 46:50.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He actually gave a talk to a
group at the
Vatican in 2014 in which he
outlined a lot

46:50.408 --> 46:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these worries, the sense that
he has that
the West and Islam are on the
path of a major

46:58.449 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clash and war, something that'’s
going to
be very destructive.

47:01.819 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He warns in very dire,
apocalyptic terms,
as Ann put it, the potential for
radical Islamic

47:08.893 --> 47:12.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jihadis to really gain ground in
Europe and
also United States.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that'’s something that you
see, a thread
through all of his work.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Stephen Bannon himself
didn'’t talk
to you for your article, right?

47:18.536 --> 47:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you did talk to other people
around it
or who have worked with him.

47:21.472 --> 47:25.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do they say to explain or
defend or what
he'’s after?

47:25.576 --> 47:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOLD: People who know him and
have worked
with him say that he does not
harbor bias

47:30.748 --> 47:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and animus toward Muslims as a
whole.

47:32.950 --> 47:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it seems that really this
perception of
what Islam is has been overtaken
in his mind

47:39.757 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the radical elements that he
really sees
as the vast majority of people
who practice

47:46.597 --> 47:48.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Islam.

47:48.499 --> 47:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, I think it'’s sort of
hard to separate
where his personal views are and
his political

47:51.869 --> 47:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
views are, but there is no
question, when
he talks about Islam, he talks
about it as

47:56.974 --> 48:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of a threatening set of
beliefs, as opposed
to a religion.

48:00.177 --> 48:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Ann, you brought up
Michael Moore earlier,
right, as someone that Stephen
Bannon admires,

48:05.116 --> 48:07.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a sense, as a filmmaker.

48:07.184 --> 48:10.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There'’s a long tradition of
agitprop-type
documentary making.

48:10.921 --> 48:11.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HORNADAY: Absolutely.

48:11.922 --> 48:13.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they'’re both polemicists.

48:13.591 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think Michael Moore
also appeals
to emotion, in a very different
way.

48:16.527 --> 48:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For one thing, he uses himself.

48:17.528 --> 48:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: On the completely other
side.

48:18.529 --> 48:20.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HORNADAY: Exactly.

48:20.131 --> 48:23.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And he'’s really kind of
perfected his on-screen
persona, this everyman persona.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that'’s a rhetorical
strategy, in and
of itself.

48:26.003 --> 48:28.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Bannon has very much stayed
behind the
scenes.

48:28.873 --> 48:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, sometimes, he directs these
films.

48:31.275 --> 48:32.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sometimes, he doesn'’t.

48:32.276 --> 48:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He often will write them.

48:34.178 --> 48:38.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even just - even when he'’s
only producing
them, they really do share, I
think, this

48:38.349 --> 48:40.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of common grammar.

48:40.151 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Matea said, what'’s
interesting,
especially in "Torchbearer," is
that nowhere

48:45.256 --> 48:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does he kind of acknowledge that
Islam and
Judaism and Christianity,
they'’re all Abrahamic

48:51.195 --> 48:52.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religions.

48:52.530 --> 48:55.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The God presumably is the same
God that they'’re
all worshiping.

48:55.099 --> 48:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that'’s nowhere - he really
doesn'’t
see Islam as a religion.

48:58.035 --> 48:59.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It'’s more of an ideology.

48:59.970 --> 49:02.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Matea Gold and Ann
Hornaday, thank
you both very much.

49:02.473 --> 49:03.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GOLD: Thank you.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HORNADAY: Thank you.

49:05.342 --> 49:07.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: And, for the record,
we'’ve asked
the White House for an interview
with Mr.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bannon about this and other
subjects.

49:09.780 --> 49:15.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have declined our requests
for now.

49:15.686 --> 49:27.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Finally, to our
NewsHour Share,
something that caught our eye
that we thought

49:27.565 --> 49:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might be of interest to you too.

49:29.433 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Oregon zoo has gotten an
unusual amount
of snow this winter and has a
video that1'’s

49:33.971 --> 49:38.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone viral of its residents
frolicking in
the powder to prove it.

49:38.309 --> 49:42.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reached out to one of the
zoo'’s head
keepers to learn more about how
they and their

49:42.479 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

AMY CUNNINGHAM, ANIMAL CURATOR,
OREGON ZOO:
My name is Amy Cunningham, an
animal curator

49:48.552 --> 49:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here at the Oregon Zoo in
Portland.

49:50.354 --> 49:55.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I've been here about 15 years
and I think
we've had maybe three or four
snow events

49:55.426 --> 49:57.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have actually caused us to
close the
zoo.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This year's been really
exceptional.

49:59.330 --> 50:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not only did we get a lot of
snow, but it
stayed around for days and days.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we'’re ever close to the
public, our
essential staff, the people who
feed the animals,

50:08.839 --> 50:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our veterinarians, our grounds
crew, they
make it in regardless of what
the weather

50:13.043 --> 50:14.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is doing.

50:14.912 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They'’ve been known to walk
across the city
to make sure someone'’s here to
take care

50:16.614 --> 50:18.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the animals.

50:18.415 --> 50:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are definitely a lot of
animals here
at the zoo for whom snow would
be normal in

50:21.285 --> 50:23.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their environment.

50:23.220 --> 50:27.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of our native Northwest
animals, the polar
bears, the river otters that
we've got, cougars

50:27.825 --> 50:30.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and black bears, they all really
enjoy it.

50:30.194 --> 50:33.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a positive reaction for the
most part
when they see the snow coming
down.

50:33.831 --> 50:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of them will go out
and explore
and have a great time.

50:37.501 --> 50:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are certainly animals here
at the zoo
for whom snow would not be part
of their natural

50:41.405 --> 50:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environment - all of the animals
from Africa,
for example, or elephants, or
Asian elephants.

50:46.810 --> 50:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like your cat or your dog,
the first
time they see snow, there's
investigation,

50:50.881 --> 50:52.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surprise.

50:52.716 --> 50:55.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, they like it and will
romp around
for a while and then realize
they'’re getting

50:55.586 --> 50:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awfully cold and wet and be
ready to come
inside.

50:58.422 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they'’ll have access to the
indoors,
even if they can be outside in
the cold.

51:04.094 --> 51:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even our Amur tiger and leopard
that are from
the Siberian region, they have
heated rocks

51:08.966 --> 51:10.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sheltered places where they
can go.

51:10.868 --> 51:15.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For us, I think it's an exciting
opportunity
for the animals to - regardless
of where

51:15.506 --> 51:18.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they're from to be - to
experience something
new and different.

51:18.275 --> 51:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think about it, getting
to encounter
different kinds of substrate
types, water,

51:23.647 --> 51:29.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
snow, ice, soil, straw,
different kinds of
bedding is yet another way we
make sure that

51:29.420 --> 51:32.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our animals have a pretty
comprehensive experience
of the world.

51:32.957 --> 51:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one of the reasons
people get so excited
about videos of animals in the
snow is it

51:37.294 --> 51:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really - is reminiscent, it sort
of recaptures
that childhood joy and
excitement you have

51:42.299 --> 51:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it's going to be a snow day
tomorrow.

51:44.468 --> 51:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think polar bears, unlike
children
at age 7, as I could attest for
my child,

51:50.374 --> 51:53.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can be in the snow for
hours and hours
without ever feeling it.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no whining about cold
fingers.

51:54.979 --> 51:57.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no complaining about
where is the
hot chocolate.

51:57.815 --> 52:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're just - the sheer joy of
getting
to interact with that
environment, without

52:01.885 --> 52:09.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any negative consequences, is a
really fun
thing for people to watch.

52:09.393 --> 52:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNISH: Once again, the top
story of the
day, the federal appeals court
based in San

52:19.703 --> 52:23.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Francisco has refused to
reinstate President
Trump'’s immigration order.

52:23.640 --> 52:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A three-judge panel issued the
unanimous ruling
late today.

52:27.711 --> 52:32.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump called it a
political decision
and he tweeted to say, "See you
in court.

52:32.216 --> 52:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The security of our nation is at
stake."

52:35.386 --> 52:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that'’s the NEWSHOUR for
tonight.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'’m Audie Cornish.

52:38.222 --> 52:40.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And it's been great to
have you
with us this week.

52:40.224 --> 52:41.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

52:41.225 --> 52:42.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORNISH: Thank you so much.

52:42.226 --> 52:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And I'’m Judy Woodruff.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, join us online and again
right here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
David Brooks.

52:47.264 --> 52:53.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the PBS
NEWSHOUR, thank you
and we will see you then.

52:53.637 --> 52:57.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the PBS
NEWSHOUR, thank you
and we will see you then.
