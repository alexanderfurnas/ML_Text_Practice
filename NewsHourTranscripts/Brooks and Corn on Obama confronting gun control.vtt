JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a rare
Q&amp;A: the president
of the United States face to
face with concerned

00:06.173 --> 00:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens during a CNN town hall
Thursday night,
the topic, gun safety and gun
rights.

00:13.180 --> 00:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama made the case
for the executive
actions he announced earlier
this week, saying

00:18.518 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his proposals balance the need
to prevent
gun deaths with the
Constitution's right to

00:23.657 --> 00:25.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bear arms.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I respect the Second Amendment,
I respect

00:28.929 --> 00:36.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the right to bear arms. I
respect people who
want a gun for self-protection,
for hunting,

00:36.937 --> 00:40.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sportsmanship.

00:40.173 --> 00:48.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all of us can agree that it
makes sense
to do everything we can to keep
guns out of

00:48.515 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hands of people who would
try to do others
harm or to do themselves harm.

00:53.487 --> 00:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier in the
day, House Speaker
Paul Ryan wrote off the
president as someone

00:59.626 --> 01:05.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who put too much emphasis on
limiting access
to guns, at the expense of
Second Amendment

01:05.165 --> 01:06.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I don't think the president -- I
think he's

01:09.803 --> 01:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been pretty hostile to the
Second Amendment
all along.

01:12.306 --> 01:19.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think the president has
a lot of respect
for the Second Amendment. And
guess what is

01:19.379 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the most important things
that we can
do as citizens, collectively, to
protect ourselves

01:24.151 --> 01:27.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from some possible terrorist
attack? Exercising
our Second Amendment rights.

01:27.688 --> 01:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings
us to the analysis
of Brooks and Corn. That's New
York Times

01:32.426 --> 01:37.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
columnist David Brooks, and
David Corn, Washington
bureau chief for "Mother Jones"
and an analyst

01:37.998 --> 01:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for MSNBC. Mark Shields is away
this week.

01:41.268 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We welcome you both.

01:41.969 --> 01:42.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: Thank you.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gentlemen.

01:44.871 --> 01:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, David Brooks, who is right?
Does the president
respect the Second Amendment or
doesn't he?

01:48.709 --> 01:51.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I have got to side
with Obama
on this one.

01:52.012 --> 01:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He -- the Second Amendment
guarantees guns,
some possession. It doesn't
guarantee all

01:58.085 --> 02:02.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns. It doesn't guarantee a
freedom from
background checks. It doesn't
mean you can't

02:02.789 --> 02:04.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
regulate them in some way.

02:04.758 --> 02:09.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think he's been
reasonably respectful
toward the Second Amendment. I
personally

02:09.796 --> 02:15.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
support most of what he
proposed. Do I think
it will do a lot of good?
Probably not. The

02:15.202 --> 02:19.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
history of gun control
legislation from the
Brady Bill, backwards and
forwards, has been

02:19.740 --> 02:24.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it can reduce suicides, but
it doesn't
seem to have a huge effect on
homicide rates.

02:24.544 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the effect of what the
president proposes
is, I think, minimal, but
probably a positive

02:29.850 --> 02:34.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
small step in the right
direction. And it
boggles the mind to think it
would be in violation

02:34.454 --> 02:36.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Constitution.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Corn, what
about this?
Is Ryan right or is the
president?

02:38.325 --> 02:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Paul Ryan was doing
sort of a
mild version of what the
Republican conservative

02:43.663 --> 02:49.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line has been, which is really
to be sort
of, I think, demagogic when
talking about

02:49.102 --> 02:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, that he wants
to take guns
away.

02:52.472 --> 02:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just earlier in the week, Marco
Rubio put
out a campaign ad saying that
the president

02:56.143 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to take your guns. And
that's been the
line from the NRA Over and over
again. And

03:01.748 --> 03:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's really not true. He can't.
And there's
nothing that he's proposed that
would take

03:06.420 --> 03:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guns away from people who
actually possess
them already.

03:10.123 --> 03:14.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think the very
interesting thing
about the town hall meeting was
that the president

03:14.561 --> 03:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took that on directly. And he
said, there
are conspiracy theories out
there about me,

03:19.566 --> 03:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I want to confront them. And
he wondered
why the NRA wasn't there last
night, because

03:24.004 --> 03:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they had been invited to come.

03:25.772 --> 03:30.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the reason was because
he was ready
to really call them out on that
point, and

03:30.210 --> 03:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't want to have that
honest disagreement
with the president.

03:34.981 --> 03:40.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks, is
there any
movement on this issue? Are we
just frozen,

03:40.520 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with each side standing its
ground?

03:42.189 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Mm-hmm, frozen.

03:43.423 --> 03:44.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:44.624 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: You know, it's
become a cultural
issue.

03:46.660 --> 03:51.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, I thought Obama
is trying to
begin to defuse that, but it is
just a fact

03:51.098 --> 03:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a lot of people, especially
in rural
parts of the country, think that
gun control

03:54.801 --> 03:59.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a symbol for, we don't like
your lifestyle.
And they feel outsiders are
dictating to them

03:59.940 --> 04:01.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their lifestyle.

04:01.775 --> 04:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even non-gun owners in
rural parts
of Virginia or wherever perceive
it as hostile

04:07.414 --> 04:11.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elitism. And I think that's how
it's frozen.
That's why it's frozen.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: It's interesting,
because that
wasn't always the case.

04:13.887 --> 04:20.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in 1994, Reagan urged
banning the making
of AK-47s and assault weapons.
Chris Christie

04:20.727 --> 04:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says that he got into politics
in the early
'90s because he wanted to do
something about

04:25.232 --> 04:29.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guns. Even Marco Rubio, when he
ran in 2000,
said he was for reasonable
restrictions.

04:29.669 --> 04:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there used to be this
ability for Democrats
and some Republicans to talk
about this stuff.

04:35.509 --> 04:40.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Republican Party, it has
just moved
so far to the right, I think
goaded by the

04:40.280 --> 04:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NRA, that there really is no
room to talk
about this without it becoming
sort of caricatures.

04:46.086 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there is also
conversation
in the Democratic Party. The
president also,

04:50.190 --> 04:55.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks, wrote an op-ed
piece for The
New York -- in your newspaper
today, in which,

04:55.128 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among other things, he made some
of the same
arguments that he did last night
in that town

04:58.965 --> 05:04.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hall, but he also said: I won't
support a
candidate, even one in my own
party, who isn't

05:04.671 --> 05:08.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to go along with gun
reform, with
significant -- some people
looked at that

05:08.675 --> 05:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a shot at Bernie Sanders.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, Sanders
has got a
lot of wiggle room. And the
president left

05:13.013 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself some wiggle room.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Sanders is the nominee, I
guarantee you
Barack Obama will be there for
him.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVID CORN: Yes.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And then the other
-- if there
are any other Democrats, they
probably come

05:21.121 --> 05:24.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from red states and they
wouldn't want Barack
Obama campaigning for them
anyway.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to me, that was a sentence
without much
meaning.

05:26.526 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But -- and in
reaction to that,
evidently, or at least because
of it, David

05:32.566 --> 05:38.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corn, you had Hillary Clinton's
campaign today
pointing out that what -- some
of the past

05:38.972 --> 05:40.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
votes of Bernie Sanders.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is that all about?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

05:43.210 --> 05:46.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, you know, the
rap on Hillary
Clinton within the Democratic
Party has always

05:46.713 --> 05:49.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been that she's not progressive
enough.

05:49.182 --> 05:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders, obviously,
on issues of
the economy, and financial
reform, and in

05:54.654 --> 06:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign policy, is to her left,
and probably
more in line with a lot of
people, the Democratic

06:00.160 --> 06:01.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primary voters.

06:02.028 --> 06:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, guns is one place where
there is a little
distance. There is not a great
difference,

06:07.867 --> 06:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there is some distance. You
look at some
past votes where she is more
progressive than

06:12.439 --> 06:17.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders. And so any
chance the Hillary
Clinton campaign has to make
something out

06:17.210 --> 06:18.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that, they did.

06:19.012 --> 06:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they leaped upon the Obama
op-ed today
to point out, well, maybe he
won't campaign

06:24.451 --> 06:28.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, just -- at least to
suggest that,
which I don't think is a
possibility.

06:28.488 --> 06:32.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is that
something that
makes a difference in Iowa or
New Hampshire,

06:32.659 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which are coming up in a few
weeks?

06:34.327 --> 06:34.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: I don't think...

06:36.930 --> 06:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: There's only one
small group
of people who vote on the gun
issue. And that's

06:39.366 --> 06:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NRA. Nobody else votes on
the gun issue
in this country, which is why
it's hard to

06:42.802 --> 06:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pass gun control legislation.

06:44.604 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
ask you about
-- there is more to talk about,
about the

06:48.742 --> 06:50.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the Republican side,
you're seeing
-- yes, you saw this
Clinton-Sanders back

06:53.380 --> 06:58.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and forth, but, on the
Republican side, among
-- David Brooks, among the
so-called establishment

06:58.418 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, they're taking more
potshots
at one another.

07:02.656 --> 07:08.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're hearing a lot of back and
forth between
Rubio and Cruz, between Rubio
and Christie.

07:08.161 --> 07:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's going on over there,
or is anybody
making any headway among that
group?

07:12.365 --> 07:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, Ted Cruz is
making headway.

07:14.868 --> 07:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's -- you begin to see
little signs of
liftoff. Trump has sort of
ceiling-ed out.

07:20.473 --> 07:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carson is collapsing. And Cruz
is somehow
beginning to get some momentum
from Iowa and

07:24.744 --> 07:28.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elsewhere. And so people are
either mimicking
him, which Rubio is doing a
little by adopting

07:28.815 --> 07:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the dark and satanic
tones that Cruz
has, and so...

07:34.020 --> 07:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you --
let me just
ask, what did you just say?

07:36.089 --> 07:37.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:37.924 --> 07:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, if you go to
a Cruz -- if
you watch a Cruz speech, it's
like, we have

07:40.393 --> 07:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got this enemy, we have got that
enemy, we're
going to stomp on this person,
we're going

07:42.862 --> 07:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to crush that person, we're
going to destroy
that person.

07:45.565 --> 07:51.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an ugly world in Ted
Cruz's world. And
it's combative. And it's angry,
and it's apocalyptic.

07:51.838 --> 07:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, actually, if
you go to a
speech from his dad, who is a
pastor, evangelical,

07:57.444 --> 07:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rafael Cruz, it actually is
satanic.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:01.281 --> 08:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: He -- I watched a
speech in which
he said Satan was behind the
Supreme Court

08:03.283 --> 08:05.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decision to legalize gay
marriage.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, it's not...

08:06.586 --> 08:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: OK. Well, I
withdraw the satanic
from Ted Cruz.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: You're thinking that
it's political,
but, sometimes, it's literal.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Mephistophelian,
maybe.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:14.260 --> 08:18.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But it's dark and
combative,
and, frankly, harsh. It's a
harsh -- he gets

08:18.865 --> 08:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some jokes in the beginning, but
then it's
just, we have enemies. We're in
an apocalyptic

08:22.335 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation. We're on the edge of
the abyss.
You need a tough guy to beat
that back.

08:27.474 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's his personality.
That's not Marco
Rubio's personality. He's a
sunny -- he's

08:32.278 --> 08:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been running the youthful
optimism campaign,
but he's beginning, to prevent
Cruz from getting

08:37.584 --> 08:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liftoff, to mimic sort of that,
get a piece
of that.

08:40.253 --> 08:45.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally think it's a
mistake, because
inauthentic -- inauthenticity
almost never

08:45.425 --> 08:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
works. And so, if Cruz starts to
go like -- I
mean, if Rubio starts to go like
Cruz, he

08:50.463 --> 08:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just doesn't look like himself,
and that bothers
people.

08:52.565 --> 08:56.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: I think the
interesting dynamic
is, a few months ago, the
conventional wisdom,

08:56.736 --> 09:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has been wrong at every
turn of this
campaign, was that Trump would
kind of fade

09:00.407 --> 09:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the beginning of the voting,
and there
would be a couple different
spots for people

09:04.477 --> 09:06.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to land in.

09:06.312 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, Trump hasn't
faded. Cruz has
sort of moved up, but he is not
an establishment

09:10.950 --> 09:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate. So that has left the
so-called
establishment candidates,
whether it's Rubio,

09:15.388 --> 09:19.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kasich, Christie, whoever you
put in that
group, fighting for third place.

09:19.993 --> 09:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the desperation
level has just
really amped up. And I see them
all as, like,

09:25.131 --> 09:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guys in a pool treading water
and trying to
splash water in the face of the
others, because

09:30.003 --> 09:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're so desperate not to be
cut out...

09:31.738 --> 09:33.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:33.573 --> 09:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: ... because Cruz and
Trump seem
to have a lock, at least in
Iowa, on the first

09:36.976 --> 09:38.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two positions.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, in New
Hampshire, it seems
to me there's more room to play.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVID CORN: Yes.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To keep the water
analogy,
rather than the satanic analogy
there.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:46.486 --> 09:48.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: I think so, too.

09:48.321 --> 09:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they kind of all seemed to
make a decision
in December that they had to do
-- they had

09:54.627 --> 09:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have some sort of a showing
in Iowa, because
there just isn't enough room for
The train

09:59.866 --> 10:01.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of Manchester at the end of
that...

10:01.734 --> 10:03.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:03.403 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But is any one of
them -- you
mentioned Christie, Kasich,
Rubio.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Oh, Jeb Bush.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:07.774 --> 10:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You didn't --
neither one of
you has mentioned Jeb Bush.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Oh, yes. There is
this guy named
Jeb Bush, yes.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is any one of
them making headway,
the kind of headway that could
last for a

10:14.414 --> 10:15.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few weeks?

10:15.748 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Well, no one seems
to be having
a breakout moment.

10:18.485 --> 10:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christie has been moving up a
little bit,
only in New Hampshire. Rubio has
had a little

10:23.490 --> 10:29.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of burst and then kind of
leveled out.
So, maybe we will be surprised
the first week

10:29.229 --> 10:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in February in New Hampshire,
but, so far,
I don't see anybody coming out
of the pack

10:34.901 --> 10:35.435 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

10:37.270 --> 10:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I still think it will be a
Cruz-Rubio
thing by the end of the first
two. But then

10:43.776 --> 10:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you go down South, and Cruz has
some natural
turf to run there. And so he
just has a straighter

10:48.715 --> 10:50.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line to the nomination.

10:50.350 --> 10:56.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I personally think his
personality is not
ideal for a candidate in
likability.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean Cruz.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But -- I'm trying
to compensate
for my past crudeness.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cruz, yes, yes.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so -- but he
-- if you look
now, I still think he's the guy
with the straightest

11:05.798 --> 11:07.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line to the nomination.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you don't --
you -- specifically,
you have mentioned Rubio a few
times. You

11:09.802 --> 11:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't see Christie? You don't
see Kasich,
Bush?

11:11.938 --> 11:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Christie is
like -- he's
like what McCain did in '08. He
just sits

11:16.476 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, and has town hall after
town hall in
New Hampshire.

11:19.679 --> 11:25.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, like McCain, he's a genius
at formulation.
He's great at riffling. And so
it's working

11:25.985 --> 11:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him. So, he's coming up. And
you begin
to see people taking shots at
Christie. But

11:29.889 --> 11:32.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not acceptable to all parts
of the party.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz -- Rubio is acceptable to
all parts of
the party, which makes him the
most viable

11:36.863 --> 11:38.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alternative.

11:38.665 --> 11:43.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: Well, not on
immigration, though.
That is still a very big
liability for Rubio.

11:43.236 --> 11:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eventually, he has to get votes
from the Republican
base. The Republican base hates
anything to

11:48.942 --> 11:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with immigration reform. And
he has tried
to run away from that. But if he
gets closer,

11:54.013 --> 11:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other people will remind the
base of where
he used to be.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I differ on
that.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who stand up at these
meetings,
they tend to not have any
tolerance for what

12:01.254 --> 12:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio did a couple years ago.
But if you poll
Republican primary voters, there
are some

12:06.292 --> 12:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls where a majority favor
some sort of
path to citizenship. So, among
the actual

12:10.663 --> 12:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, the silent majority,
there is a lot
more flexibility than you would
think if you

12:14.300 --> 12:16.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just listen to the questions at
the town halls.

12:16.102 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You get the sense
Republican
primary voters may be
struggling, those who

12:20.340 --> 12:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
haven't decided yet may be
struggling still
about what to do.

12:24.243 --> 12:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The health care reform law, ACA,
the Republicans
in the House finally got enough
votes, David

12:32.285 --> 12:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, week. The Senate had
already passed
repeal. Now the House has. They
got it to

12:37.557 --> 12:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president's desk. Now, he's
vetoed it.

12:39.993 --> 12:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Paul Ryan, we hear him
saying today, we're
going to -- this isn't the last
you heard

12:44.664 --> 12:46.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is the ACA in real jeopardy
here?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No. No.

12:50.069 --> 12:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if a Republican wins, it's
entrenched.
The systemic disruption that
would caused

12:55.408 --> 13:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by simply getting rid of it
would be catastrophic
for a lot of companies and a lot
of actual

13:00.546 --> 13:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who are actually doing
stuff on the
ground.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a Republican got in, it would
change a
lot. But, frankly, if a Democrat
gets in,

13:06.352 --> 13:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is going to change a lot.
Some of the really
startling premium hikes that
we're seeing

13:11.658 --> 13:15.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from some of the insurance
companies are going
to cause huge problems down the
road.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even if a Democrat gets in,
there's going
to have to be some changes. But
it's very

13:18.998 --> 13:23.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard to see you just -- just
uprooting it?
It's too deeply entrenched.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see?

13:24.904 --> 13:30.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: It wasn't even
repealed. They
repealed the part of the law
that requires

13:30.109 --> 13:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to have insurance, but
they kept in
the stuff that's popular, which
is, if you

13:34.347 --> 13:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have preexisting conditions, you
can get coverage.
Anyone can get coverage.

13:37.784 --> 13:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem is, if you take
away the requirement,
and you just leave the ability
of people with

13:44.624 --> 13:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
preexisting conditions to get
coverage, then
premiums truly skyrocket.

13:48.661 --> 13:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what they were doing, they
were voting
for a way to create a death
spiral without

13:53.132 --> 13:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
replacing it with anything. So
they don't
want this bill to pass. And, if
you look at

13:57.870 --> 14:03.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- in Kentucky, a good case
study, where a
Tea Party candidate won saying
he would repeal

14:03.109 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obamacare, Bevin, he became
governor.

14:06.179 --> 14:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in between New Year's Day
and Christmas,
he very quietly said he wasn't
going to get

14:11.184 --> 14:15.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rid of the Medicaid expansion
that he promised
to, because it's working in
Kentucky.

14:15.188 --> 14:19.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
that's a
model for what is -- a
forerunner of what's

14:19.859 --> 14:21.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening in Washington?

14:21.728 --> 14:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CORN: Yes, I don't --
listen, they can't
get rid of it without tremendous
dislocation

14:25.465 --> 14:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to real people. They will pay a
real political
cost.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they haven't suggested an
alternative.
So I think it was just all
showmanship. And

14:32.905 --> 14:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was kind of funny that Paul
Ryan was saying,
look what we have accomplished
today.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
leave it there
with what we accomplished here.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Corn, David Brooks, we
thank you both.

14:44.917 --> 14:51.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CORN: Thank you.

14:51.257 --> 14:56.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks.
