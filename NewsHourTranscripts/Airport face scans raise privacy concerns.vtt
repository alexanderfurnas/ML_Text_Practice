AS YOU BOARD AN OVERSEAS FLIGHT.

00:04.404 --> 00:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALREADY BEING TESTED IN A

WHAT THEY CALL NON-IMMIGRANT

00:57.524 --> 00:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGNERS-- AND THAT'S, LIKE,

00:58.892 --> 01:00.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50 MILLION PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE

01:04.964 --> 01:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETTER TRACK OF THAT.

SAY I TAKE MY PHOTO, OR THE

THE BIOMETRIC INFORMATION.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ET CETERA, THEIR BIRTH DATE.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S GOT A PHOTO WHICH IS

01:44.104 --> 01:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCODED IN THAT CHIP.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO

01:47.474 --> 01:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPARE IT AGAINST, SAY,

OUTSTANDING ARREST WARRANTS.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY, IF SOMEONE IS WANTED

01:52.579 --> 01:54.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR A CRIME.

01:54.547 --> 01:55.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S NOT

01:55.315 --> 01:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO RETAIN THIS

PATROL OFFICIAL I SPOKE TO SAID

02:03.556 --> 02:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY'RE NOT PRECLUDING THAT

02:05.158 --> 02:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FUTURE THEY COULD RETAIN

02:06.893 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT INFORMATION.

02:08.428 --> 02:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ACCURACY OF THESE IMAGES,

02:12.732 --> 02:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S SAY YOU GET CAUGHT IN KIND

02:14.467 --> 02:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A FACE SCAN TRAP AND THERE'S

02:16.669 --> 02:18.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FLAG, BUT IT'S... IT'S A CASE

02:18.872 --> 02:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, FACIAL RECOGNITION

02:21.441 --> 02:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TECHNOLOGY IS STEADILY IMPROVING

02:24.010 --> 02:25.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THE YEARS.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S NOW... THE BEST OF IT

02:26.980 --> 02:31.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS AT 90% TO 95% ACCURACY.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, THE EXPERTS THAT I

02:32.952 --> 02:34.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKED TO SAID THAT THERE ARE

02:34.787 --> 02:37.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APT TO BE MISMATCHES.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF THERE IS A MISMATCH, WHAT

02:38.625 --> 02:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN HAPPEN?

02:39.592 --> 02:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST OF ALL, IT CAN CAUSE

02:40.760 --> 02:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVELING DELAYS.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO 50 PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO

02:48.268 --> 02:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET STOPPED AND HAVE TO GO

02:49.769 --> 02:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH A MANUAL CHECK.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE ISSUE IS ALSO ON THAT

02:54.541 --> 02:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISMATCH, WHAT IF I'VE GOT AN

>> Sreenivasan: I KNOW IN THE

03:02.849 --> 03:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS

03:04.083 --> 03:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THESE ALGORITHMS AREN'T

03:05.318 --> 03:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING OR

03:07.620 --> 03:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISIDENTIFYING WOMEN OR PEOPLE

03:09.255 --> 03:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SET THAT THEY USED.

03:11.624 --> 03:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> INDEED, THAT'S TRUE.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:16.796 --> 03:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THIS, AND HE SAYS THAT

03:18.898 --> 03:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A BIAS AGAINST PEOPLE

03:22.168 --> 03:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

USED.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
