02:11.865 --> 02:12.799

02:12.799 --> 02:14.301
AFGHANISTAN'S SIXTH LARGEST

CITY, WAS THE TALIBAN'S BIGGEST

BORDERS.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.521
THIS IS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR YOUR

02:34.521 --> 02:34.955
ORGANIZATION.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.056
YOU'VE LIKELY BEEN IN CONTACT

02:36.056 --> 02:37.157
WITH SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT

02:37.157 --> 02:39.326
WERE AFFECTED IN KUNDUZ.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.961
WHAT DO THEY DESCRIBE IS

02:40.961 --> 02:41.328
HAPPENING?

02:41.328 --> 02:42.763
>> YES, IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF

02:42.763 --> 02:44.765
THE DARKEST DAYS IN OUR

02:44.765 --> 02:45.499
ORGANIZATION'S HISTORY.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.933
AND WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE

02:46.933 --> 02:50.604
TEAMS ON THE GROUND, AND WE ARE

02:50.604 --> 02:51.705
EVACUATING OUR INTERNATIONAL

02:51.705 --> 02:53.240
STAFF FROM KUNDUZ, AND WHAT THEY

02:53.240 --> 02:55.675
TELL US IS THE BOMBS HIT AROUND

02:55.675 --> 02:57.978
2:00 A.M. THIS MORNING

02:57.978 --> 03:01.114
AFGHANISTAN TIME IN KUNDUZ.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.749
AND THEN THEY HEARD PLANES

03:02.749 --> 03:03.250
CIRCLING AROUND.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.185
THERE WAS A PAUSE AND THEN THERE

03:05.185 --> 03:06.787
WERE MORE BOMBS HIT.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.255
AND THAT HAPPENED AGAIN AND

03:08.255 --> 03:08.588
AGAIN.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.190
AND WHEN OUR STAFF WENT OUT OF

03:10.190 --> 03:12.325
THEIR OFFICE, THE MAIN HOSPITAL

03:12.325 --> 03:13.827
BUILDING WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES,

03:13.827 --> 03:15.295
AND WE HAD PATIENTS WHO WERE

03:15.295 --> 03:17.764
UNABLE TO ESCAPE WHO DIED IN

03:17.764 --> 03:18.198
THEIR BEDS.

03:18.198 --> 03:18.999
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

03:18.999 --> 03:20.967
ANYWHERE ANY OF THE WOUNDED NOW

03:20.967 --> 03:22.869
CAN GO IF THAT HOSPITAL IS

03:22.869 --> 03:23.303
INCAPACITATED?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.505
>> NO, YOU'RE SEEING A LOSS OF

03:25.505 --> 03:26.673
ACCESS TO TRAUMA CARE.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.942
IT WAS THE ONLY FACILITY IN THIS

03:28.942 --> 03:30.310
AREA, IN THE NORTHEASTERN REGION

03:30.310 --> 03:31.845
OF AFGHANISTAN.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.313
WE'VE BEEN TREATING HUNDREDS OF

03:33.313 --> 03:35.582
WOUNDED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS

03:35.582 --> 03:38.051
DURING THE FIGHTING IN KUNDUZ.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.119
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAVE YOU

03:39.119 --> 03:41.088
DONE AFTERWARDS FOR YOUR STAFF

03:41.088 --> 03:41.855
IN THAT AREA?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.790
>> WE HAVE EVACUATED OUR

03:43.790 --> 03:46.526
INTERNATIONAL STAFF TO KABUL AND

03:46.526 --> 03:47.694
TRANSPORTED THE WOUNDED TO

03:47.694 --> 03:49.596
ANOTHER HOSPITAL ABOUT TWO HOURS

03:49.596 --> 03:51.264
AWAY, AND WE'RE TRYING TO RIGHT

03:51.264 --> 03:53.066
NOW PROVIDE AS MUCH SUPPORT TO

03:53.066 --> 03:55.168
THEM AS POSSIBLE IN KUNDUZ.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.203
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT SORTS OF

03:56.203 --> 03:58.171
EFFORTS OR MEASURES DID YOU GO

03:58.171 --> 04:00.006
TO, TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE

04:00.006 --> 04:01.108
FIGHTING PARTIES KNEW THAT YOU

04:01.108 --> 04:02.275
WERE A SAFE ZONE?

04:02.275 --> 04:05.278
>> WELL, WE MAKE DIRECT CONTACT

04:05.278 --> 04:07.647
AT THE FIELD LEVEL WITH VARIOUS

04:07.647 --> 04:08.148
ARMED GROUPS.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.083
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT ON

04:10.083 --> 04:12.119
SEPTEMBER 29, AND THE WEEKS

04:12.119 --> 04:14.187
PRIOR, WE HAD MADE SURE THAT AT

04:14.187 --> 04:16.389
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BOTH THE

04:16.389 --> 04:18.091
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN CHAIN OF

04:18.091 --> 04:19.226
COMMAND IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

04:19.226 --> 04:20.560
THEY HAD THE G.P.S. COORDINATES

04:20.560 --> 04:21.761
OF OUR COMPOUND.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.430
AND AT THE OUTSET OF THE ATTACK

04:23.430 --> 04:26.066
WE ALSO MADE CONTACT WITH

04:26.066 --> 04:28.869
VARIOUS CONTACTS AT THE JOINT

04:28.869 --> 04:29.836
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE TO REITERATE

04:29.836 --> 04:31.238
THE ATTACK WAS UNFOLDING.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.606
AND WE CONVEYED THAT INFORMATION

04:32.606 --> 04:34.341
IN REAL TIME, AND WE SAW NOTHING

04:34.341 --> 04:34.674
CHANGE.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.710
AND YOU SEE NOW THAT WE HAVE 19

04:36.710 --> 04:37.043
DEAD.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.044
>> Sreenivasan: JUST TO

04:38.044 --> 04:39.679
CLARIFY-- ONCE THE HOSPITAL WAS

04:39.679 --> 04:42.282
UNDER ATTACK, YOUR AGENCY MADE

04:42.282 --> 04:44.151
CONTACT WITH THE U.S. MILITARY,

04:44.151 --> 04:46.786
THE AFGHAN FORCES TO TELL THEM,

04:46.786 --> 04:48.922
AND THE BOMBS STILL KEPT

04:48.922 --> 04:49.356
FALLING?

04:49.356 --> 04:51.458
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.393
WE INFORMED OUR CONTACTS, BOTH

04:53.393 --> 04:55.629
IN WASHINGTON AND KABUL LEVEL,

04:55.629 --> 04:58.598
AND THE ATTACKS CONTINUED TO

04:58.598 --> 05:00.800
HAPPEN, IN SPITE OF OUR EFFORTS,

05:00.800 --> 05:01.968
BOTH IN THE DAYS PRIOR AND WHEN

05:01.968 --> 05:03.270
THE ATTACK WAS UNFOLDING.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.237
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN YOU MEET

05:04.237 --> 05:05.539
WITH PENTAGON OFFICIALS OR OTHER

05:05.539 --> 05:06.706
PEOPLE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

05:06.706 --> 05:07.741
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

05:07.741 --> 05:08.909
>> WE WANT AN EXPLANATION, AND

05:08.909 --> 05:10.377
WE WANT AN INDEPENDENT

05:10.377 --> 05:10.877
INVESTIGATION.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.646
WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

05:12.646 --> 05:13.146
HAPPENED.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.314
THERE'S HONESTLY NO

05:14.314 --> 05:14.814
JUSTIFICATION.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.683
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS WAS A

05:16.683 --> 05:17.951
FULLY FUNCTIONING HOSPITAL, AND

05:17.951 --> 05:19.886
WE NEED ANSWERS, AND WE NEED

05:19.886 --> 05:21.188
THOSE ANSWERS NOT JUST FROM THE

05:21.188 --> 05:22.622
U.S. MILITARY BUT WE NEED SOME

05:22.622 --> 05:23.590
KIND OF INDEPENDENT

05:23.590 --> 05:24.824
INVESTIGATION THAT'S CREDIBLE.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.493
AND WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HEAR

05:26.493 --> 05:27.928
THAT THIS WAS SOME KIND OF

05:27.928 --> 05:29.996
MISTAKE AND THAT THERE'S JUST

05:29.996 --> 05:30.597
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.364
>> Sreenivasan: ALSO, THERE

05:31.364 --> 05:33.600
WERE SOME REPORTS THAT PERHAPS

05:33.600 --> 05:36.269
THE TALIBAN HAD INFILTRATED THE

05:36.269 --> 05:37.237
COMPOUND AND WERE ACTUALLY

05:37.237 --> 05:38.071
FIRING FROM THERE.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.673
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, DID ANY

05:39.673 --> 05:40.607
MEMBER OF YOUR ORGANIZATION

05:40.607 --> 05:42.442
WITNESS THAT OR WERE YOU UNDER

05:42.442 --> 05:43.476
THREAT IN THAT WAY?

05:43.476 --> 05:44.611
>> WE WERE NOT UNDER THREAT IN

05:44.611 --> 05:45.245
ANY WAY.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.880
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS FAR

05:46.880 --> 05:48.915
AS OUR STAFF NOW, THE GATES OF

05:48.915 --> 05:50.250
THE HOSPITAL COMPOUND WERE

05:50.250 --> 05:53.153
CLOSED ALL NIGHT SO THAT NO

05:53.153 --> 05:54.454
ONE-- THERE IS NOT STAFF, A

05:54.454 --> 05:56.389
PATIENT OR CARETAKER WAS INSIDE

05:56.389 --> 05:57.490
THE HOSPITAL WHEN THE BOMBING

05:57.490 --> 05:57.991
HAPPENED.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.292
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN

05:59.292 --> 06:00.860
MIND, ACCORDING TO MILITARY LAW,

06:00.860 --> 06:02.562
ANY INJURED PERSON IN THE

06:02.562 --> 06:06.132
HOSPITAL IS CONSIDERED A

06:06.132 --> 06:06.700
NONCOMBATANT.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.767
WHATEVER SIDE THEY MAY HAVE

06:07.767 --> 06:08.602
FOUGHT FOR BEFORE.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.071
IN ANY CASE, BOMBING A FULLY

06:11.071 --> 06:12.005
FUNCTIONING HOSPITAL CAN NEVER

06:12.005 --> 06:13.373
BE JUSTIFIED.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.641
>> Sreenivasan: JASON CONE,

06:14.641 --> 06:17.010
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MTV

06:17.010 --> 06:17.944
U.S.A., THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

06:17.944 --> 06:19.879
YOUR TIME AND I'M SORRY FOR YOUR

06:19.879 --> 06:20.413
LOSS.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.414
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.115
>> Sreenivasan: A MEDICAL

06:22.115 --> 06:23.183
EXAMINER HAS DETERMINED THE

06:23.183 --> 06:24.884
CAUSE OF DEATH OF THE GUNMAN WHO

06:24.884 --> 06:26.186
CARRIED OUT THURSDAY'S MASS

06:26.186 --> 06:27.320
SHOOTING AT UMPQUA COMMUNITY

06:27.320 --> 06:28.722
COLLEGE IN RURAL ROSEBURG,

06:28.722 --> 06:29.623
OREGON.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.924
CHRISTOPHER HARPER-MERCER DIED

06:30.924 --> 06:32.659
OF A SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT

06:32.659 --> 06:34.094
WOUND, POLICE SAID TODAY.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.062
THEY ALSO SAID THE GUNMAN OWNED

06:36.062 --> 06:37.931
OR POSSESSED 14 GUNS.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.966
HE BROUGHT SIX OF THEM TO CAMPUS

06:39.966 --> 06:41.268
AND USED A HANDGUN IN HIS

06:41.268 --> 06:42.135
RAMPAGE.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.703
WE NOW KNOW THE NINE PEOPLE HE

THE WRITING CLASS THAT WAS

06:53.413 --> 06:54.247

06:54.247 --> 06:55.548
RUSSIA IS VOWING TO INCREASE THE

06:55.548 --> 06:57.150
INTENSITY OF AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA

06:57.150 --> 06:58.184

07:02.555 --> 07:04.291
CENTRAL SYRIA TODAY, A TOTAL OF

07:04.291 --> 07:05.825
MORE THAN 60 AIR STRIKES IN THE

07:06.960 --> 07:08.595
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT VIDEO SHOWED

07:08.595 --> 07:10.030
WARPLANES STRIKING WHAT RUSSIA

07:16.002 --> 07:17.637
BUT THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES SAY

07:17.637 --> 07:19.039
THE RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES ARE ALSO

07:19.039 --> 07:20.907
HITTING FREE SYRIAN ARMY REBELS

07:20.907 --> 07:22.776

JUMPING ON TRUCKS, CAUSING THE

07:43.430 --> 07:45.732
TUNNEL TO BE CLOSED TEMPORARILY.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.367
SOME MIGRANTS GOT AS FAR AS NINE

MILES INTO THE TUNNEL BEFORE

07:49.135 --> 07:50.403

20,000 REFUGEES FROM SYRIA OVER

07:57.644 --> 07:58.545
GERMANY'S PRESIDENT SAYS THE

07:58.545 --> 08:00.046
MIGRANT CRISIS IS A CHALLENGE

08:00.046 --> 08:01.781
THAT MAY OCCUPY THE COUNTRY FOR

08:01.781 --> 08:02.816
GENERATIONS.

SAID TODAY MIGRANTS COMING ONLY

08:17.030 --> 08:19.099
FOR ECONOMIC REASONS WOULD NOT

08:19.099 --> 08:20.700

08:20.700 --> 08:22.469
GERMANY EXPECTS TO ABSORB AS

08:22.469 --> 08:25.004
MANY AS 800,000 ASYLUM SEEKERS

08:33.380 --> 08:34.748
RAIN COMBINED WITH THE STORM

08:34.748 --> 08:36.383
SURGE IS CAUSING SEVERE FLOODING

08:36.383 --> 08:37.717
IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.852
THE WORST FLOODING IS OCCURRING

08:38.852 --> 08:40.220
IN THE CAROLINAS, WHERE SEVERAL

08:40.220 --> 08:41.621
FEET OF WATER HAS CAUSED SOME

08:41.621 --> 08:43.289
ROADS TO BE SHUT DOWN AND

08:43.289 --> 08:45.158
COMMUNITIES EVACUATED.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.436
EVENT ON-AIR AND ONLINE, FOCUSED

09:29.436 --> 09:31.671
ON KEEPING KIDS ON A PATH TO

09:31.671 --> 09:33.173
GRADUATION, FEATURING

09:33.173 --> 09:34.674
CONVERSATIONS AND REPORTS ON

EARLY EDUCATION, DROPOUT

09:36.509 --> 09:37.977
PREVENTION AND COLLEGE

09:37.977 --> 09:39.078
COMPLETION.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.180
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT

09:40.180 --> 09:41.681
TONIGHT, WE LOOK AT HOW TEACHERS

09:41.681 --> 09:43.750
ARE BEING TRAINED FOR CAREERS IN

09:43.750 --> 09:44.784
THE CLASSROOM.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.186
HALF OF AMERICAN TEACHERS

09:46.186 --> 09:47.620
ACTUALLY QUIT THE PROFESSION

09:47.620 --> 09:49.322
AFTER ONLY A FEW YEARS ON THE

09:49.322 --> 09:50.256
JOB.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.558
BUT AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM IN

09:51.558 --> 09:53.293
BOSTON HELPS SCHOOLS RETAIN

09:53.293 --> 09:54.961
TEACHERS LONGER WHILE

09:54.961 --> 09:56.763
RECRUITING MORE SCIENCE AND MATH

09:56.763 --> 09:58.731
TEACHERS AND MORE TEACHERS OF

09:58.731 --> 09:59.466
COLOR.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.266
THE NEWSHOUR'S CHRISTOPHER

10:00.266 --> 10:01.668
BOOKER HAS THE STORY.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.243

10:10.243 --> 10:11.878
WEEK ON THE JOB FOR 22-YEAR-OLD

10:11.878 --> 10:13.379
RENEE ALVES.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.981
>> WHEN YOU SAY YOU COUNTED BY

10:14.981 --> 10:17.217
ONES, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.017
>> Reporter: SHE'S ASSIGNED TO

10:18.017 --> 10:19.219
THIS THIRD GRADE CLASS AT THE

10:19.219 --> 10:20.386
DUDLEY STREET NEIGHBORHOOD

10:20.386 --> 10:21.821
CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE ROXBURY

10:21.821 --> 10:23.656
SECTION OF BOSTON, BUT SHE IS

10:23.656 --> 10:25.124
NOT A TEACHER YET.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.025
SHE IS PART OF A TRAINING

10:26.025 --> 10:27.126
PROGRAM CALLED THE BOSTON

10:27.126 --> 10:28.361
TEACHER RESIDENCY.

10:28.361 --> 10:32.098
>> COUNT BY MULTIPLES OF TEN.

10:32.098 --> 10:32.866
>> Reporter: AS ONE OF 40

10:32.866 --> 10:33.967
RESIDENTS IN THE TEACHER

10:33.967 --> 10:35.435
TRAINING PROGRAM THIS YEAR,

10:35.435 --> 10:36.769
RENEE WILL SPEND TEN MONTHS

10:36.769 --> 10:38.505
WATCHING, EMULATING AND

10:38.505 --> 10:40.106
LEARNING AS MUCH AS SHE CAN FROM

10:40.106 --> 10:42.308
EXPERIENCED TEACHER KAYLA MORSE.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.576
>> AND WHAT MULTIPLICATION

10:43.576 --> 10:46.312
EQUATION CAN I WRITE TO

10:46.312 --> 10:46.880
REPRESENT THAT?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.948
>> YOU CAN LEARN FROM A

10:48.948 --> 10:50.149
TEXTBOOK, BUT I THINK IT'S A LOT

10:50.149 --> 10:51.150
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE IN A

10:51.150 --> 10:52.552
CLASSROOM AND YOU'RE SEEING IT

10:52.552 --> 10:53.686
IN PERSON.

10:53.686 --> 10:54.721
>> Reporter: RENEE'S LENGTHY

10:54.721 --> 10:55.922
TRAINING PERIOD IS PART OF A

10:55.922 --> 10:57.724
TRANSFORMATION IN THE WAY BOSTON

10:57.724 --> 10:59.058
AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER CITIES

10:59.058 --> 11:00.460
PREPARE THEIR TEACHERS.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.895
WHILE SOME TEACHER TRAINING

11:01.895 --> 11:03.196
PROGRAMS REQUIRE ONLY A FEW

11:03.196 --> 11:05.031
WEEKS IN THE CLASSROOM, THESE

11:05.031 --> 11:06.566
RESIDENCY MODELS REQUIRE FAR

11:06.566 --> 11:07.634
MORE.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.402
IN 2003, JESSE SOLOMON, WHO

11:09.402 --> 11:10.970
TAUGHT MATH IN BOSTON PUBLIC

11:10.970 --> 11:12.505
SCHOOLS FOR TEN YEARS, CO-

11:12.505 --> 11:13.673
FOUNDED THE PROGRAM THAT HE

11:13.673 --> 11:15.875
LIKENS TO A MEDICAL RESIDENCY.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.377
>> ONE THING I SAW A LOT WHEN I

11:17.377 --> 11:20.380
WAS TEACHING WAS A NUMBER OF

11:20.380 --> 11:21.481
BRAND NEW TEACHERS COMING INTO

11:21.481 --> 11:23.049
THE PROFESSION.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.618
SMART, COMMITTED, HARD-WORKING,

11:25.618 --> 11:26.686
KIND OF WILLING TO DO WHATEVER

11:26.686 --> 11:28.922
IT TAKES, BUT NOT REALLY KNOWING

11:28.922 --> 11:30.657
HOW TO TEACH THAT FIRST YEAR.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.958
MY CONCERN WAS ALWAYS THAT THEY

11:31.958 --> 11:33.092
WERE LEARNING ON THE BACKS ON

11:33.092 --> 11:34.594
THE KIDS THAT HAD THEM THAT

11:34.594 --> 11:35.261
YEAR, RIGHT?

11:35.261 --> 11:37.297
SO IF YOU'RE A FIRST-YEAR

11:37.297 --> 11:39.933
TEACHER IN ALGEBRA 1 CLASS, YOU

11:39.933 --> 11:41.434
GET ANOTHER SHOT NEXT YEAR.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.969
FOR THOSE KIDS TAKING ALGEBRA 1,

11:42.969 --> 11:44.037
THAT WAS THEIR SHOT AT ALGEBRA

11:44.037 --> 11:44.737
1.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.407
SO HAD IN MY HEAD THAT THERE'S

11:47.407 --> 11:49.042
GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY TO DO

11:49.042 --> 11:49.842
THIS.

11:49.842 --> 11:50.677
>> Reporter: SOLOMON'S GOALS

11:50.677 --> 11:52.145
WERE TO COUNTERACT BOSTON'S

11:52.145 --> 11:53.813
HEAVY TEACHER TURNOVER RATE,

11:53.813 --> 11:55.281
FILL KEY SHORTAGES OF MATH AND

11:55.281 --> 11:56.649
SCIENCE SPECIALISTS, AND

11:56.649 --> 11:57.917
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MINORITY

11:57.917 --> 11:58.985
TEACHERS.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.754
>> OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW INVESTS

12:01.754 --> 12:03.456
IN THE PREPARATION OF DOCTORS TO

12:03.456 --> 12:04.657
THE TUNE OF ABOUT HALF A MILLION

12:04.657 --> 12:05.792
DOLLARS PER DOCTOR.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.261
SO WE'VE OBVIOUSLY DECIDED THAT

12:08.261 --> 12:09.529
TO INVEST IN THE TRAINING OF

12:09.529 --> 12:10.163
THOSE DOCTORS.

12:10.163 --> 12:10.930
SO I'M NOT ARGUING WE SHOULD

12:10.930 --> 12:12.065
SPEND HALF A MILLION DOLLARS PER

12:12.065 --> 12:12.999
TEACHER.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.400
BUT IF EDUCATION IS REALLY AS

12:14.400 --> 12:15.368
IMPORTANT AS EVERYBODY SAYS IT

12:15.368 --> 12:16.502
IS, AND IF TEACHERS ARE REALLY

12:16.502 --> 12:17.437
AS IMPORTANT AS EVERYONE SAYS

12:17.437 --> 12:18.871
THEY ARE, THEN WE SHOULD BE

12:18.871 --> 12:19.872
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE AS A

12:19.872 --> 12:21.774
COUNTRY INVEST IN THE

12:21.774 --> 12:23.042
RECRUITMENT, PREPARATION SUPPORT

12:23.042 --> 12:24.143
OF TEACHERS.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.311
>> Reporter: RENEE SPENDS MONDAY

12:25.311 --> 12:26.713
THROUGH THURSDAYS AS KAYLA'S

12:26.713 --> 12:28.514
APPRENTICE, AND FRIDAYS IN

12:28.514 --> 12:29.616
GRADUATE COURSES.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.718
>> ONE WAY TO DO IT IS COUNT BY

12:31.718 --> 12:32.352
TEN.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.119
>> Reporter: SHE AND HER FELLOW

12:33.119 --> 12:33.987
TRAINEES WILL FINISH THE

12:33.987 --> 12:35.221
RESIDENCY WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE

12:35.221 --> 12:36.756
IN EDUCATION AND BECOME PART OF

12:36.756 --> 12:37.590
THE GROWING ROSTER OF

12:37.590 --> 12:39.559
CLINICALLY-TRAINED TEACHERS IN

12:39.559 --> 12:41.761
THE BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.795
THREE OUT OF FOUR OF THESE

12:42.795 --> 12:44.364
GRADUATES FROM THE PAST 12 YEARS

12:44.364 --> 12:46.099
ARE STILL TEACHING IN BOSTON, A

12:46.099 --> 12:47.500
CITY WHERE ONE OUT OF TWO HAVE

12:47.500 --> 12:49.135
LEFT THE PROFESSION.

12:50.536 --> 12:51.537
KAYLA MORSE FINISHED THE PROGRAM

12:51.537 --> 12:52.739
FOUR YEARS AGO.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.807
>> I'VE BEEN TEACHING AT THIS

12:54.807 --> 12:57.844
SCHOOL FOR GOING ON TWO YEARS.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.379
AND WHAT'S KEPT ME HERE IS HOW

12:59.379 --> 13:01.347
THIS SCHOOL IS SET UP.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.383
IT'S A COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.085
SO I FEEL VERY CONNECTED TO THE

13:06.085 --> 13:08.621
VISION OF NOT ONLY PREPARING

13:08.621 --> 13:11.658
STUDENTS FOR THE WORLD BUT ALSO

13:11.658 --> 13:14.494
PREPARING MORE TEACHERS.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.728
>> Reporter: WHEN YOU'RE

13:15.728 --> 13:17.997
THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU'LL WORK

13:17.997 --> 13:18.965
WITH RENEE, ARE YOU MIRRORING A

13:18.965 --> 13:19.699
LOT OF YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES AS A

13:19.699 --> 13:21.367
RESIDENT?

13:21.367 --> 13:23.336
>> SO A LOT OF TIMES I DO MIRROR

13:23.336 --> 13:25.505
MY EXPERIENCES WITH HER, BUT I

13:25.505 --> 13:28.007
ALSO THINK ABOUT IF I WAS NEW TO

13:28.007 --> 13:30.443
THIS PROFESSION OR THIS PLACE,

13:30.443 --> 13:32.912
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

13:32.912 --> 13:33.913
I WOULD NEED TO KNOW TO WORK

13:33.913 --> 13:35.882
BETTER.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.250
>> Reporter: DO YOU FEEL A

13:37.250 --> 13:38.184
RESPONSIBILITY TO KIND OF KEEP

13:38.184 --> 13:40.453
HER FIRE BURNING?

13:42.488 --> 13:44.190
THIS WORK IS CHALLENGING, AND IT

13:44.190 --> 13:46.159
CAN REALLY GET TO YOU, BUT I

13:46.159 --> 13:48.094
FEEL LIKE WHAT KEEPS ME GOING IS

13:48.094 --> 13:49.696
THAT FIRE, AND SOME OF THE SAME

13:49.696 --> 13:51.097
THINGS WE TALK ABOUT WITH OUR

13:51.097 --> 13:52.699
KIDS, INDEPENDENCE,

13:52.699 --> 13:54.300
PERSEVERANCE, PROBLEM-SOLVING,

13:54.300 --> 13:55.935
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I KIND OF

LONG WAY IN THE LAST TWO

14:01.607 --> 14:02.875
DECADES.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.377
THESE HOMES HAVE REPLACED EMPTY

14:04.377 --> 14:05.812
LOTS WHERE CITY BUSINESSES USED

14:05.812 --> 14:07.180
TO DUMP THEIR TRASH IN THE

14:07.180 --> 14:08.314

14:08.314 --> 14:09.649

14:09.649 --> 14:10.850
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, ALMOST HALF

14:10.850 --> 14:12.118
OF THE CHILDREN IN THE AREA LIVE

14:12.118 --> 14:13.019
IN POVERTY, AND THE PROGRAM

14:13.019 --> 14:14.987
RECOGNIZES THIS.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.757
SCHOOL WHEREVER THEY LIKE, BUT

14:50.757 --> 14:52.592
WE'D LIKE THEM TO HAVE THE

14:52.592 --> 14:53.760
OPTION TO SEND THEM TO A QUALITY

14:53.760 --> 14:54.494
SCHOOL IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IF

KEEPING KIDS CLOSE TO HOME.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.202
>> UNLIKE THE OTHER SCHOOLS IN

15:03.202 --> 15:04.637
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, WE WERE ABLE

15:04.637 --> 15:05.838
TO BE A PART OF THE VISIONING OF

15:05.838 --> 15:07.540
WHAT THIS SCHOOL WOULD LOOK

15:07.540 --> 15:09.642
LIKE, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR OUR

15:09.642 --> 15:10.443

15:19.185 --> 15:20.186
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE

15:20.186 --> 15:21.187
CHALLENGING HOME ENVIRONMENT

15:21.187 --> 15:21.921
SOME OF THEIR STUDENTS MAY COME

15:21.921 --> 15:23.356
FROM.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.224
>> I HAVE TO BE REALLY MINDFUL

15:25.224 --> 15:26.659
OF EVERYTHING THAT MY STUDENTS

15:26.659 --> 15:29.028
COME INTO THE CLASSROOM WITH.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.296
YOU KNOW, STUDENTS WHO COME FROM

15:30.296 --> 15:31.798
A DIFFICULT HOME LIFE.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.932

15:32.932 --> 15:35.468
YOU WITH ROXBURY BEFOREHAND?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.235

15:36.235 --> 15:38.137
SURPRISINGLY.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.573
I GREW UP MAYBE 25, 30 MINUTES

15:40.573 --> 15:42.341
AWAY FROM HERE BUT BEFORE, YOU

15:42.341 --> 15:44.811
KNOW, STARTING TO TEACH HERE,

15:44.811 --> 15:47.213
THE RESIDENCY TOOK US THROUGHOUT

15:47.213 --> 15:49.081
THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND REALLY

15:49.081 --> 15:50.483
TAUGHT US ABOUT WHERE WE'RE

15:50.483 --> 15:52.552
GOING TO BE WORKING.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.386
AND SO THAT REALLY ALLOWED ME TO

15:53.386 --> 15:55.521
UNDERSTAND ROXBURY.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.924

16:03.029 --> 16:04.564

16:04.564 --> 16:06.299
ONLY RETAINING MORE TEACHERS BUT

16:06.299 --> 16:07.333
HIRING MORE SCIENCE AND MATH

16:07.333 --> 16:08.968

16:12.471 --> 16:13.773
IT HASN'T ALL GONE ACCORDING TO

16:13.773 --> 16:14.640
PLAN.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.509
A 2011 HARVARD STUDY FOUND THAT

16:16.509 --> 16:17.910
STANDARDIZED MATH TEST SCORES

16:17.910 --> 16:19.579
WERE LOWER AMONG STUDENTS TAUGHT

16:19.579 --> 16:21.180

16:21.180 --> 16:22.515
FIRST YEAR TEACHERS COMING FROM

16:22.515 --> 16:24.150
TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.384
THIS TREND CONTINUES UNTIL THE

16:25.384 --> 16:26.953
FOURTH YEAR OF TEACHING WHEN

16:26.953 --> 16:28.154
SCORES IN RESIDENT CLASSROOMS

16:28.154 --> 16:30.256
SURPASS THEIR COUNTERPARTS.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.259
>> IT WAS A PIVOT POINT.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.094
I'D BE LYING IF I DIDN'T SAY

16:35.094 --> 16:35.895
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN LOTS OF PIVOT

16:35.895 --> 16:37.029
POINTS.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.065
YOU KNOW, IT'S SORT OF LIKE

16:39.065 --> 16:40.433
YOU GO INSTITUTE A BUNCH OF

16:40.433 --> 16:41.934
THINGS, YOU GET SOME SUCCESS.

16:41.934 --> 16:42.969
BUT ALL THAT REALLY DOES IS

16:42.969 --> 16:43.769
TEACH YOU ABOUT THE NEXT

16:43.769 --> 16:44.503
CHALLENGE THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE

16:44.503 --> 16:46.539
ON.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.974
>> Reporter: IN RESPONSE TO THE

16:47.974 --> 16:50.009

FOR-- FOR THE KIDS IN THIS

17:05.491 --> 17:07.026
SCHOOL.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.695
BUT I THINK THE BIG QUESTION

17:09.695 --> 17:11.230
THAT WE'RE WRESTLING WITH NOW IS

17:11.230 --> 17:14.133
ULTIMATELY ARE OUR TEACHERS GOOD

17:14.133 --> 17:15.401
FOR THE KIDS THEY SERVE IN THE

UNDETERRED, DRIVEN BY HER TIME

17:23.476 --> 17:24.911
WITH THE STUDENTS.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.345

17:28.180 --> 17:29.482
THAT AHA MOMENT, AND THEIR FACE
