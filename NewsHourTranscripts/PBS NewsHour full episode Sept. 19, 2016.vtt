BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor of New

have every right to believe this
was an act

00:11.278 --> 00:12.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
terror.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Security on high
alert.

00:14.448 --> 00:19.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

00:38.105 --> 00:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN, Librarian of
Congress: There
is a hunger in this digital age
to hear authors

00:43.610 --> 00:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together, to participate in
programs, to just
be in a place, a community
space.

00:50.250 --> 00:54.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more

(BREAK)

00:56.456 --> 01:09.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: They say they have
got their man.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now they're trying to figure out
his motive.

01:12.172 --> 01:17.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An arrest this morning in New
Jersey has ended
a manhunt in a series of
bombings and attempted

01:17.544 --> 01:20.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombings around New York City
and New Jersey.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: Ahmad Khan Rahami

an ambulance, bloody and dazed
after a gun

01:28.522 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
battle with police.

01:30.424 --> 01:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 28-year-old naturalized U.S.
citizen from
Afghanistan was captured in
Linden, New Jersey,

01:36.596 --> 01:40.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after he was recognized sleeping
in the doorway
of a bar.

01:40.667 --> 01:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was just hours after police
sent text
alerts to millions in the New
York metro area

01:45.973 --> 01:47.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be on the lookout for him.

01:47.941 --> 01:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the shoot-out, in which
two police officers
and the suspect were injured,
New York City

01:52.446 --> 01:55.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mayor Bill de Blasio firmly
labeled the bombings
terrorism.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor of New
York: We
have so more much information
obviously than

01:58.952 --> 02:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we even had a few hours ago.

02:01.555 --> 02:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Based on the information we have
now, we have
every reason to believe this was
an act of

02:05.993 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
terror.

02:07.828 --> 02:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It all began on
Saturday morning
in a bomb attack in the beach
town of Seaside

02:12.399 --> 02:17.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Park, New Jersey, before a
charity race to
benefit Marines.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No one was injured there.

02:19.006 --> 02:24.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later that night, in the Chelsea
neighborhood
of Manhattan, another bomb went
off, injuring

02:24.177 --> 02:25.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
29 people.

02:25.545 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Surveillance video allegedly
caught Rahami
planting the device.

02:30.150 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A second device, made from a
pressure cooker
filled with shrapnel, was found
undetonated

02:35.422 --> 02:37.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a few blocks away.

02:37.691 --> 02:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last night, five more pipe
bombs were
found at a train station in
Elizabeth, New

02:42.329 --> 02:43.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jersey.

02:43.630 --> 02:50.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As robots worked to dismantle
them, one exploded
suddenly.

02:50.070 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials linked all of the
attacks to Rahami,
but offered limited details
about how they

02:54.674 --> 02:56.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
made that connection.

02:56.443 --> 03:01.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, with Rahami as a named
suspect, police
descended on his family home in
Elizabeth.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: He's a very friendly guy.

03:04.851 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what's so scary.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's hard when it's home.

03:06.853 --> 03:07.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They never seemed out of the
ordinary.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were just Americanized.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You would have never known
anything.

03:12.959 --> 03:19.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At a midday press
conference,
an FBI official said the agency
cannot yet

03:19.232 --> 03:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say why Rahami planted the
bombs, but that
he appeared to have acted alone.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL SWEENEY, FBI: I have no
indication that
there is a cell operating in the
area or in

03:27.641 --> 03:29.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The investigation is ongoing,
so, as we develop
more information, we continue to
go.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have no indication that
there is a cell
operating here.

03:34.581 --> 03:38.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama
weighed in from
New York, where he's attending
the United

03:38.485 --> 03:40.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nations General Assembly.

03:40.353 --> 03:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Even as we have to be vigilant
and aggressive,

03:44.191 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both in preventing senseless
acts of violence,
but also making sure that we
find those who

03:50.730 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carry out such acts and bring
them to justice,
we all have a role to play as
citizens in

03:57.771 --> 03:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making sure that we don't
succumb to that
fear.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the wake of the
attacks and
with hundreds of world leaders
converging

04:03.877 --> 04:11.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the city, police and
bomb-sniffing dogs
swarmed New York's Penn Station
today.

04:11.384 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, 1,000 National
Guardsmen have
been deployed on the streets of
New York City.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rahami underwent surgery earlier
today.

04:18.792 --> 04:22.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was shot in the leg during
and the arm
during the shoot-out with
police.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will have more on the
investigation right
after the news summary.

04:26.333 --> 04:30.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
president said there's no
connection between

04:30.370 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the bombings in New York and New
Jersey and
the stabbings at a Minnesota

it inspired
the attacker, who was killed by
an off-duty

04:43.917 --> 04:45.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policeman.

04:45.218 --> 04:49.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's identified as Dahir Adan, a

from Somalia.

04:49.389 --> 04:55.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Syrian military
declared today
that a week-long cease-fire is
over, and within

04:55.495 --> 04:57.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours, launched dozens of
airstrikes.

04:57.664 --> 05:02.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.N. confirmed a
humanitarian aid convoy
was attacked, and opposition
activists said

05:02.302 --> 05:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it was hit by Russian or Syrian
planes.

05:05.372 --> 05:09.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New York, Secretary of State
John Kerry
refused to concede the truce is
dead.

05:09.943 --> 05:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: The Russians
need to control Assad, who
evidently is indiscriminately

05:15.782 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bombing, including on
humanitarian convoys.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So let's wait and see.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will collect the facts.

05:21.521 --> 05:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to see where we are, and
then we will
make a judgment.

05:25.725 --> 05:31.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Activists said the
various airstrikes
killed more than 30 people,
including a dozen

05:31.331 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the aid convoy.

05:33.433 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. airstrikes
may have accidentally
killed at least eight police
officers in Afghanistan.

05:39.206 --> 05:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Afghan commander says it
happened Sunday
near Tirin Kot, the capital of
Uruzgan Province.

05:45.512 --> 05:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: In Russia,
supporters of President
Vladimir Putin won a landslide
in Sunday's

05:56.556 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parliamentary elections.

05:58.391 --> 06:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Russia bloc took
three-quarters
of the seats in the Lower House
of Parliament.

06:03.063 --> 06:07.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The party will have enough votes
to pass constitutional
amendments on its own.

06:07.634 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turnout was down sharply from
the last election
in 2011.

06:11.171 --> 06:17.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scientists now
say the haze
from forest fires in Indonesia
may have led

06:17.143 --> 06:20.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the deaths of more than
100,000 people.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is based on new analysis of
mortality
data.

06:24.284 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fires were used to clear
land and burned
for weeks last year.

06:29.422 --> 06:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers at Harvard and
Columbia universities
say most of the deaths occurred
in Indonesia,

06:46.840 --> 06:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They credited aerial spraying of

JUDY WOODRUFF: For the first
time, federal
prosecutors say New Jersey
Governor Chris

06:55.148 --> 07:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christie knew a bridge was being
closed to
punish a political foe as it was
happening.

07:01.955 --> 07:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governor denies that, but
the prosecutors
say a witness will so testify at
the trial

07:07.360 --> 07:09.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of two Christie allies.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It opened today.

07:10.797 --> 07:14.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A defense lawyer called the
witness -- quote
-- "a habitual liar."

07:14.367 --> 07:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Wall Street was
mostly uninspired
today.

07:17.937 --> 07:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost three
points to close at 18120.

The Nasdaq fell nine points, and

slipped a fraction of a point.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a deeper
look at what we know about the
bombings in

07:32.986 --> 07:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York and New Jersey; the
presidential
candidates' respond to the
attacks; U.N. leaders

07:38.658 --> 07:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
search for solutions to the
world's refugee
crisis; and much more.

07:46.800 --> 07:58.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
the attacks
in New York and New Jersey.

07:58.878 --> 08:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the capture of a man
suspected of planting
bombs in both states over the
weekend come

08:04.718 --> 08:09.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new questions about the terror
threat and
stopping radicalization in this
country.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joining us now to address them,
Juliette Kayyem.

08:12.892 --> 08:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a former U.S. Department

And Lorenzo Vidino, he's the
director of the
Program on Extremism at George
Washington

08:28.241 --> 08:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University's Center for Cyber
and Homeland
Security.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

08:34.814 --> 08:36.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lorenzo, let me start with you.

08:36.349 --> 08:41.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you make of this man
Ahmad Khan Rahami
and what he did?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LORENZO VIDINO, George
Washington University:
Well, we don't know a lot of
facts at this

08:43.990 --> 08:45.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think most indications point
to the fact
that he had some kind of
political motivation.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think -- is talking about
terrorism.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know much about his
radicalization.

08:53.266 --> 08:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're getting tidbits
here and there
of visits to Afghanistan, which,
per se, don't

08:57.971 --> 09:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessarily mean much because
he's of North
African descent.

09:01.574 --> 09:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did a mini-terror campaign,
if you look
at the tactic, the use of
pressure cookers.

09:08.114 --> 09:13.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that al-Qaida and
al-Qaida
sympathizers used in the past.

09:14.020 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The targets seem to have some
political motives,
a certain neighborhood in New
York, the Marine

09:20.994 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Corps marathon.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know much.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're starting to get a
picture of
somebody that had some signs of
radicalization.

09:29.002 --> 09:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Juliette Kayyem,
what do you
make of this, the sophistication
of it, how

09:33.173 --> 09:35.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he carried it out?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIETTE KAYYEM, Former
Department of Homeland
Security Assistant Secretary:
Well, not very

09:36.509 --> 09:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sophisticated in terms of the
pressure cooker.

09:40.079 --> 09:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How to make it can be found
online and the
different elements of it are
pretty rudimentary.

09:44.451 --> 09:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did make a large quantity of
them, but
just to remind viewers, if all
of these incidents

09:50.623 --> 09:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are connected, he had about a 25
percent success
rate.

09:53.927 --> 09:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what I'm curious about
is, how quick
was that radicalization process,
that, you

09:59.399 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, was this over three months
and he figured
it out how to do it quickly, or
is it over

10:03.369 --> 10:06.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two years and there were a
number of people
involved in the action?

10:06.706 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that is going to be
relevant
to determine whether it's just
him, him and

10:10.910 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another person, or a larger
network.

10:12.979 --> 10:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I wouldn't close anything off
yet solely
based on the materials or the
bombs.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lorenzo Vidino,
what kind of
work needs to be done now to
figure out if

10:22.589 --> 10:24.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others were involved?

10:24.524 --> 10:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: Well, first of
all, his connections
overseas and his connections
domestically.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities are all over social
media and
obviously are going to figure
out his contacts,

10:32.866 --> 10:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he had Facebook profile,
Twitter account,
who he was talking to, his cell
phone.

10:37.604 --> 10:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the most immediate is
his contacts
here in the States.

10:41.741 --> 10:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The assumption is, I think, is
that there
are no contacts trying to plan
follow-up attacks,

10:46.946 --> 10:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that's obviously not a
guarantee.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know for sure, so,
trying to see
people who are immediately with
touch with

10:51.317 --> 10:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him in the United States, then
if he had contacts
overseas, if he had that was
somehow directing

10:56.489 --> 10:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him or at least aware of what he
was doing
overseas.

10:58.925 --> 11:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Juliette, what do
you make
of the fact that we learned late
this afternoon

11:03.062 --> 11:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his family moved to the United
States in 1995?

11:05.532 --> 11:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We figured he would have been 7
years old
then.

11:08.468 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he grew up in this country
in that New
Jersey community, did travel
back to the region,

11:15.475 --> 11:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we believe, the last few years.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what does that add up to?

11:19.112 --> 11:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIETTE KAYYEM: It adds up to
that we don't
necessarily have an immigration
problem.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a citizen problem.

11:25.652 --> 11:30.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, unless someone is
willing to say anyone
who's been naturalized here is
automatically

11:30.790 --> 11:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspect, most of these men are
U.S. citizens.

11:33.560 --> 11:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the good news is, it's a
very small percentage
of the Islamic community so far.

11:41.434 --> 11:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we need to look at
isn't so much
-- is maybe what happened when
he traveled

11:46.005 --> 11:46.973 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abroad.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know there's a couple of
trips.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also some discussion of
a potential
of a marriage that he may have
had, so we

11:51.477 --> 11:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to look at the process of
the review
process, the interview process
when he returned,

11:56.516 --> 12:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
returned from Afghanistan, but
also the radicalization
process at home or online.

12:02.522 --> 12:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this investigation will
look very familiar,
because they will be talking to
friends and

12:06.593 --> 12:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family of his, and then there
will be, you
know, basically the online
footprint review,

12:12.398 --> 12:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was he talking to online,
was there encrypted
information, to get a better
picture of who

12:17.870 --> 12:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is and, of course, the most
important thing,
the radicalization process.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the only way we will stop
it from happening
in the future.

12:23.509 --> 12:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lorenzo, friends
of his describe
him as growing more serious,
more religious

12:27.747 --> 12:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after he came back from one of
these or I
guess all of these trips to
Afghanistan.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What does it take to put
somebody on a terrorist
watch list?

12:35.054 --> 12:38.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: Well, it's
obviously not becoming
more religious.

12:38.358 --> 12:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something that cannot by,
in itself,
lead authorities to profile and
say just because

12:43.129 --> 12:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
somebody has become more
conservative in his
views, more religious, that he
can be seen

12:47.166 --> 12:48.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a security threat.

12:48.968 --> 12:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That element, together with
other elements
much more operational, can lead
authorities

12:53.706 --> 12:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to put somebody on the radar
screen or on
some kind of watch list.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's obviously very difficult.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many cases, we're talking
about just about
internal psychological
processes, which are,

13:03.483 --> 13:06.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at times, put online.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many other cases, they're not.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's very, very difficult
for authorities,
if there are no connections, no
communications,

13:11.724 --> 13:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to really know that somebody is
of interest
and potentially dangerous.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Juliette,
what can be done
in these circumstances?

13:18.331 --> 13:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Lorenzo just said, just
because someone
becomes more religious doesn't
mean that they

13:24.270 --> 13:27.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are automatically considered
suspicious.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIETTE KAYYEM: And Lorenzo is
exactly right.

13:29.876 --> 13:33.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why people who have
been in government
or in homeland security really
talk about

13:33.846 --> 13:38.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the homeland security
enterprise, because
the idea that the government is
going to be

13:38.151 --> 13:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to prevent all these things
from happening
is just a fiction.

13:41.521 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that is why there has
been a tremendous
focus on outreach to Muslims and
Arab and

13:47.760 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other communities to integrate
them into law
enforcement, to have the kind of
relationships

13:54.467 --> 13:56.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are necessary.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In all of these cases -- and I'm
sure we will
find this in this case today --
but in all

13:59.038 --> 14:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
previous ones, someone knew.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That person was not an FBI
agent.

14:02.642 --> 14:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't a surveillance -- some
guy in the
CIA surveying.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was the ex-wife.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.448 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was the wife.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was the father.

14:10.416 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so at a time when
discussions are heated
about what to do about the
Islamic radicalization

14:17.657 --> 14:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem, I think the better way
to think about
it is, it's not a problem and
actually to

14:21.360 --> 14:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
integrate and assimilate with
these communities
is going to be the best way to
minimize the

14:26.499 --> 14:29.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat that's sometimes coming
from those
communities.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
add to that,
Lorenzo?

14:31.270 --> 14:37.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You and I have had this
conversation, I know,
after San Bernardino, after
Orlando, with

14:37.910 --> 14:39.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those incidents.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What more does it take to try to
anticipate
these things before they happen?

14:43.516 --> 14:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: I think the ugly
reality is
that some incidents are
impossible to prevent.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's -- another illusion
is that we
can prevent anything.

14:51.824 --> 14:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unless you completely militarize
a society,
which nobody is arguing that we
should, you

14:56.696 --> 14:58.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can prevent anything.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Juliette is perfectly right in
saying we should
work more with communities.

15:01.467 --> 15:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you can add a little
more resources
in terms of what we're doing
online, getting

15:06.539 --> 15:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also social media companies to
work more with
the government, again, fully
understanding

15:10.777 --> 15:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the balance of civil liberties
and First Amendment
with the need for security.

15:15.281 --> 15:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, obviously, it's a very
difficult balance
to maintain there.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The reality I that not
everything can be prevented.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's very ugly to
say, but it's
the reality.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just one last
question, Lorenzo.

15:26.325 --> 15:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are the questions that you
have in mind
right now that you think
authorities are probably

15:31.564 --> 15:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be trying to get
answers to?

15:32.832 --> 15:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: I think it's the
contacts
in the community.

15:34.967 --> 15:38.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's, who he was talking
to, did he
have a friend, was he part of a
study group?

15:38.905 --> 15:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Generally, what we see in terms
of radicalization,
even if we have lone wolves from
an operational

15:43.009 --> 15:47.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point of view, at times were
interactive with
other people both online and
offline.

15:47.413 --> 15:52.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe only one person in
that little group
of five or six like-minded
individuals decided

15:52.318 --> 15:53.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to act.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the others had the same kind
of mind-set.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe they stopped one step
short of acting.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will some of them act?

16:00.026 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Was he talking to other people?

16:01.327 --> 16:02.862 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maybe he wasn't.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, if he were, I think it's
very important
to know who he was talking to.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lorenzo Vidino,
Juliette Kayyem,
we thank you both.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: Thank you.

16:10.870 --> 16:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, online,
follow everything
we know about the bombing so
far.

16:15.408 --> 16:20.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus, watch as science
correspondent Miles
O'Brien explores the difference
between a

16:20.313 --> 16:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pressure cooker bomb and a pipe
bomb.

16:28.621 --> 16:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The attacks were
also the focus
on the campaign trail today, as
Hillary Clinton

16:38.664 --> 16:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The attacks were
also the focus
on the campaign trail today, as
Hillary Clinton

16:45.438 --> 16:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Donald Trump pushed to
convince voters
that they can keep Americans
safe.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

16:52.478 --> 16:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With terror threats
suddenly center
stage, Hillary Clinton used her
years as secretary

16:59.118 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state to say she's ready to
handle national
security.

17:03.089 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I have sat at that table in the
Situation

17:06.626 --> 17:07.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Room.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have analyzed the threats.

17:09.061 --> 17:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have contributed to actions
that have neutralized
our enemies.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know how to do this.

17:15.234 --> 17:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump used
this weekend's
attacks to underscore a defining
theme of

17:19.839 --> 17:21.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his campaign.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We have seen how failures to
screen who is

17:24.510 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entering the United States puts
all of our
citizens, everyone in this room,
at danger.

17:31.017 --> 17:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let me state very, very
clearly, immigration
security is national security.

17:41.160 --> 17:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Both candidates also
tried to highlight
their foreign policy
credentials, Clinton

17:46.766 --> 17:51.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by meeting with Ukrainian
President Petro
Poroshenko and Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo

17:51.971 --> 17:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Abe on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly
in New York.

17:55.908 --> 18:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and Trump are also to meet
separately
with Egyptian President Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi.

18:00.579 --> 18:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton and running
make Tim Kaine
campaigned separately on college
campuses.

18:07.286 --> 18:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Young voters were a key part of
the coalitions
that twice elected President
Obama, but, this

18:13.259 --> 18:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time around, Clinton is having
trouble winning
them over.

18:16.028 --> 18:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Even if
you're totally
opposed to Donald Trump, you may
still have

18:20.333 --> 18:21.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some questions about me.

18:21.968 --> 18:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get that, and I want to do my
best to answer
those questions.

18:26.539 --> 18:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton has a light
campaign schedule
for the rest of the week, ahead
of the first

18:31.143 --> 18:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate with Trump a week from
today.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

18:36.048 --> 18:42.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And with 50 days
left until Election
Day, we turn to Politics Monday
with Amy Walter

18:42.188 --> 18:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of The Cook Political Report and
Tamara Keith
of NPR.

18:45.925 --> 18:49.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, let's talk about what the
candidates
had to say on the attacks.

18:49.161 --> 18:55.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, we hear Hillary Clinton
trying to sound
knowledgeable and Donald Trump
trying to sound

18:55.501 --> 18:56.469 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strong.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Which of them wins the day on
days like today?

18:59.372 --> 19:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: And this
is really a microcosm of the
campaign.

19:04.143 --> 19:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump comes out and he
says things
that are big and bold and in
some ways controversial,

19:10.983 --> 19:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying maybe we need to bring
back profiling
and profiling at mosques
possibly, and says

19:19.058 --> 19:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that ISIS wants Hillary Clinton
to win.

19:22.561 --> 19:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton comes
out and says,
I was in the Situation Room, I
have all these

19:26.465 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plans, I have got a plan for
ISIS.

19:30.469 --> 19:36.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the way the campaign
goes, you
know, day after day after day.

19:36.475 --> 19:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet, Amy, you
write this week
and when Hillary Clinton trips
and falls,

19:43.082 --> 19:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stumbles, it's because she's
encountering
headwinds of her own making.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes,
I think that this race right now
is coming

19:49.321 --> 19:55.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
down to the structural
advantages that Hillary
Clinton has, but she has some
enthusiasm problems.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump is trying to face
off the structural
disadvantages.

19:58.564 --> 20:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unpacking that, what I mean,
is, yes,
she's had a very week, and -- or
actually

20:04.537 --> 20:05.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maybe a week-and-a-half.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Couple weeks, yes.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, couple weeks.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Couple weeks.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Whether it was her
off-the-cuff
statements at the fund-raiser
about basket

20:11.143 --> 20:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of deplorables, whether it was
her health
scare and the sort of not being
up front about

20:15.381 --> 20:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it really was, but also
that Donald Trump
himself has not given her much
fodder over

20:19.885 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last few weeks.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has been much more
disciplined.

20:23.389 --> 20:27.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're seeing Republicans
starting to
come home and getting more
enthusiastic about

20:27.393 --> 20:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him than they were when the
focus was on his
self-inflected wounds.

20:31.697 --> 20:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that the focus is on her
inflected wounds,
you're seeing that diminishment
of enthusiasm

20:37.069 --> 20:38.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from her supporters.

20:38.504 --> 20:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Tamara has talked about this
as well,
the young voters.

20:41.407 --> 20:45.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's who Hillary Clinton was
talking to
up in Philadelphia today.

20:45.544 --> 20:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, she's got a problem in
getting those
voters who supported Barack
Obama, who don't

20:50.616 --> 20:52.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Donald Trump.

20:52.451 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But right now, they are
splitting their votes
between Hillary Clinton and the
third-party

20:56.689 --> 20:58.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidates.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, I read
somewhere today -- perhaps
this is you -- that in fact part
of the reason

21:00.759 --> 21:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for her problem with millennials
is because
they see her as kind of a hawk.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That is one issue.

21:08.167 --> 21:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, news like today
doesn't necessarily
help with that, because then
she's talking

21:12.838 --> 21:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about her time in the Situation
Room, where
she was one of the people
encouraging the

21:17.977 --> 21:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president to go for it with the
bin Laden
raid.

21:20.012 --> 21:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, that turned out in a
way that is
a positive story for her.

21:24.650 --> 21:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spent a lot time today on the
Temple University
campus today talking to college
students and

21:29.989 --> 21:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recent grads about Hillary
Clinton.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I met one Trump supporter.

21:35.027 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone else who I talked to is
sort of in
the camp of, well, I guess I'm
with her, which

21:40.833 --> 21:42.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the challenge.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She needs to find a way to get
them a little
more enthusiastic.

21:44.870 --> 21:49.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, there was a lot of,
well, I'm more
afraid of the other guy.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I heard that a lot, a lot of
lesser of two
evils type of talk.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: There is no
question, Amy, that
there is an enthusiasm gap.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is now well-documented in
all these polls.

21:59.518 --> 22:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But why is it that when it
seemed -- it's
perceived that Hillary Clinton
has stumbled,

22:04.523 --> 22:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she immediately pays a price in
the polls,
and when it's perceived that
Donald Trump

22:08.127 --> 22:11.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has stumbled, as when he
suggests that maybe
the Secret Service could drop
their guns and

22:11.830 --> 22:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see what happens, Hillary
Clinton's Secret
Service, he doesn't seem to pay
that same

22:15.935 --> 22:17.670 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
price?

22:17.703 --> 22:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Though I would
argue, though,
when the focus is on either one
of them and

22:19.505 --> 22:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things that they have said
that become
much more controversial, that
you will see

22:23.642 --> 22:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the polls move up and down.

22:25.678 --> 22:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the focus was on Donald
Trump and his
attacks on the judge who is
overseeing the

22:30.749 --> 22:35.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump University case and his
Mexican heritage,
you saw the numbers spike up, he
went down,

22:35.421 --> 22:37.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she went up.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you saw after the
Republican debate,
where the focus -- I mean, not
the Republican

22:39.558 --> 22:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
debate -- the Republican...

22:40.559 --> 22:42.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Convention.

22:42.461 --> 22:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ... Convention --
thank you -- where
the focus was all anti-Hillary
Clinton, you

22:44.096 --> 22:45.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
saw her numbers go down.

22:45.664 --> 22:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After her bad week with the FBI
director coming
out, her numbers went down.

22:52.271 --> 22:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he made the focus about the
Gold Star
family, his numbers went down.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, there is an
actual...

22:58.043 --> 23:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's actual -- this
is a crazy
race.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of these candidates have
decided to make
the race a referendum on the
other person,

23:03.816 --> 23:05.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the other person being worse.

23:05.684 --> 23:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when that spotlight focus on
your opponent,
and you say, see, look how
terrible they are,

23:10.122 --> 23:11.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your side gets excited.

23:11.423 --> 23:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when it comes to you, then
the other side
gets excited.

23:14.393 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, let me read to
you something
the president said at a
fund-raiser in New

23:18.163 --> 23:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York last night about Hillary
Clinton.

23:20.399 --> 23:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "We as a society still
grapple with
what it means to see powerful
women.

23:26.405 --> 23:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it still troubles us in a
lot of ways,
unfairly," basically playing the
gender card

23:31.010 --> 23:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Hillary Clinton has made a
part of her
stump speech.

23:33.379 --> 23:35.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

23:35.214 --> 23:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he goes on to say that if
this race is
tight, it's not because of
Hillary Clinton's

23:39.852 --> 23:41.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flaws.

23:41.587 --> 23:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, back to what Amy
is talking
about, there's also how the two
candidates

23:46.992 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are judged.

23:48.761 --> 23:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is judged as a
politician,
as someone who's been in public
life, who

23:53.599 --> 23:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is careful, who is measured, who
gives a lot
of speeches, who is a
politician.

23:58.470 --> 24:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is often judged
on the standard
of someone who hasn't been a
lifelong politician,

24:04.243 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone who's new to public
life, who has
done reality TV and has been an
entrepreneur.

24:10.382 --> 24:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the president labels that
sexism.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other people label it other
things.

24:17.256 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a dynamic there that is
-- it's there.

24:21.060 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And actually the
campaign is happy
to label it sexism as well, as
far as I can

24:26.865 --> 24:28.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tell.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let me give -- take an
example of something
that we talked a lot about
today.

24:31.837 --> 24:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president was at the U.N.
General Assembly,
a lot of conversation about
refugees and about

24:37.976 --> 24:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the U.S. responsibility
should be to
refugees, especially from Syria.

24:41.980 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, once again, we're back at
the dichotomy
we saw at the beginning,
toughness vs. empathy,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I suppose.

24:48.654 --> 24:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder, does that -- does
the way these
two candidates -- do the way
that these two

24:53.792 --> 24:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates respond tell us
something, Amy?

24:56.462 --> 25:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, Hillary
Clinton definitely
wants to make this race a
referendum on temperament.

25:00.933 --> 25:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump wants to make
it a referendum
on change, and big, bold change.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, the country itself is sort
of torn.

25:07.773 --> 25:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is, I think, slightly leaning
toward change,
this idea of, after eight years
of one president

25:14.046 --> 25:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the anxiety that a lot of
Americans are
feeling about the status quo,
wanting to sort

25:18.117 --> 25:19.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of shake things up.

25:19.618 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're nervous about what
that would
look like.

25:22.755 --> 25:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he wants to definitely keep
that focus
on shaking it up, being the big
and bold candidate.

25:28.527 --> 25:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her only option is to say that
big and bold
is too dangerous, and so
stability is the

25:34.466 --> 25:36.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
answer, because she's not the
big and bold
candidate.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's not the new candidate.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she's not the change
candidate.

25:39.772 --> 25:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Tam, we know
for sure that
the alleged suspect in today's
-- in yesterday's

25:44.076 --> 25:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the weekend's bombings is not
a refugee,
but he is -- was a nationalized
citizen from

25:48.947 --> 25:50.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elsewhere.

25:50.749 --> 25:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder if that elsewhere,
the opposite,
makes it difficult for Hillary
Clinton to

25:54.386 --> 25:56.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
defend?

25:56.288 --> 26:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, I think that
it is a challenge
for her because, you know, she
talks about

26:00.993 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vetting and we need good vetting
of people
who come to this country.

26:04.930 --> 26:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And often her plans that she
talks about are
not quite as satisfying as sort
of a Trumpian,

26:13.505 --> 26:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, we're going to fix this
and -- or we're
going to blow them out of
whatever, or -- the

26:19.945 --> 26:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that she says, because
she, you know,
has been part of the Obama
administration

26:24.383 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just generally, you know, don't
have the same
splash as what Donald Trump
would say.

26:31.490 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

26:34.293 --> 26:37.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I would also say
who -- where
you sit is -- determines how
feel about these

26:37.663 --> 26:38.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a Quinnipiac poll.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you concerned about being a
victim of
terrorism? Trump supporters, 68
percent said

26:44.903 --> 26:46.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yes.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton supporters, 29 percent
believe they
are going to be a victim of
terrorism.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they both are also speaking
to their base.

26:50.642 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And if vetting is a
solution,
how do you vet someone who came
to this country

26:53.912 --> 26:55.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at 7 years old?

26:55.047 --> 26:56.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So many questions.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're done with them for
this week on
Politics Monday.

26:58.984 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara Keith, Amy Walter, thank
you both very
much.

27:04.056 --> 27:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

27:12.898 --> 27:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:18.237 --> 27:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
writer's take
on why he says the U.S.
political system has

27:23.609 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devolved into chaos; and what it
will take
to modernize the world's largest
library.

27:29.781 --> 27:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: At the United Nations
General Assembly
today, a first-of-its kind
summit on refugees

27:36.922 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and migrants was held, led by
the secretary-general,
Ban Ki-Moon.

27:41.426 --> 27:45.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, President Obama will
lead a second
meeting on the crisis.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: An estimated
65 million
people worldwide are now
considered refugees

27:51.970 --> 27:53.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and migrants.

27:53.739 --> 27:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's an increase of five
million people
over last year alone, making
this the largest

27:57.776 --> 28:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugee crisis since World War
II.

28:00.245 --> 28:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To discuss the plight of these
people, and
the current global response, I'm
joined now

28:04.149 --> 28:05.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by Filippo Grandi.

28:05.651 --> 28:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the United Nations high
commissioner
for refugees.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. High Commissioner, thank you
very much
for being here.

28:10.856 --> 28:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand today you reached a
big agreement
at the United Nations.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell us a little bit
about what was
agreed to?

28:17.262 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: Yes.

28:20.132 --> 28:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The General Assembly, meaning
all the states
in the world, have issued a
declaration which

28:26.838 --> 28:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually will be known as the
New York Declaration,
committing themselves to
protecting, assisting

28:33.879 --> 28:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees, but also finding new
ways the organize
better the response to refugee
crisis.

28:41.320 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, for a long time,
we have struggled
with the resources.

28:46.224 --> 28:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been able to give the
basics to refugees,
like blankets, medicine, some
food, but what

28:52.364 --> 28:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugees want also is a future,
is education,
is jobs.

28:55.500 --> 29:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is an effort to try to
expand our support
to them that this declaration
will help us

29:05.210 --> 29:07.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
carry out.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously, a
global agreement
of this kind is important, but
this agreement

29:10.749 --> 29:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not binding on any of the
nations that
put their name on the line.

29:14.853 --> 29:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how confident are you that
this will really
have a meaningful impact?

29:18.757 --> 29:25.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Well, first of
all, it's the
first time in history that the
General Assembly

29:25.897 --> 29:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues such a declaration, so
there is a lot
of political weight behind that.

29:31.370 --> 29:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I think that, also,
everybody has
realized -- especially when
refugees in the

29:36.108 --> 29:41.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last couple of years started
arriving in Europe,
started moving on from places
where they have

29:41.446 --> 29:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived first, I think there is
a realization
this is not a problem of one or
another country.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a global problem.

29:49.187 --> 29:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just like -- think of epidemics
or think of
climate change.

29:53.392 --> 29:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is a growing
realization that
these are global issues, global
problems that

29:58.030 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affect the whole of humanity,
and only working
together we can address the root
causes, we

30:04.069 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can address what pushes people
to move on.

30:08.774 --> 30:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that there is a
necessity and not
just a moral commitment to do
that.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I want to ask
you a little
bit about some of the headwinds
that are facing

30:17.749 --> 30:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.N. and all the nations who
are grappling
with this.

30:20.952 --> 30:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw in Germany a very big
welcome mat thrown
out, and now we have seen the
rise of a far-right

30:28.160 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nationalistic party in response.

30:30.529 --> 30:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in the U.S., we have also
seen a very
strong anti-immigrant sentiment,
driven mostly

30:36.201 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out of fears of terrorism.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm curious.

30:39.638 --> 30:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're talking to leaders
of world nations,
what do you tell them about
those sentiments?

30:42.674 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do we counter those, and
where do those
feelings lead?

30:46.044 --> 30:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: I think there
are always two
sentiments in every society.

30:50.615 --> 30:52.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is solidarity.

30:52.317 --> 30:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have seen it very much in
Europe when
refugees arrive.

30:56.621 --> 31:00.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is also a feeling of
apprehension
and rejection.

31:00.258 --> 31:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what people are, I think,
worried about
is when they see that the
response to these

31:06.331 --> 31:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flows is not orderly, is not
organized, is
not structured.

31:11.069 --> 31:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is why this declaration
also invites
everybody, all the states,
together with the

31:16.942 --> 31:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United Nations organization, to
work on these
responses, to make them more
predictable,

31:22.047 --> 31:23.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more cooperative.

31:23.849 --> 31:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Europe had reacted in that
manner back
last year, when people started
arriving in

31:29.287 --> 31:35.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large numbers, I'm persuaded
that there wouldn't
have been such a negative
reaction growing

31:35.727 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the passage of time, that
people would
have accepted that it was
important, necessary,

31:41.500 --> 31:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principled, but also possible to
receive refugees,
to give them asylum, people
fleeing from war

31:48.640 --> 31:49.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and persecution.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we need to organize that
response better.

31:51.877 --> 31:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is what -- this is the
value of this
declaration.

31:55.046 --> 31:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will help us work towards
that organization.

31:57.716 --> 32:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will give us the resources
hopefully to
do that.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The issue of
resettlement
is obviously a crucial one,
finding a more

32:05.190 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permanent home for these people,
so they're
not living in camps in
perpetuity.

32:09.594 --> 32:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the agreement today that was
-- the original
draft of that agreement asks for
a 10 percent

32:14.800 --> 32:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
annual rate of resettlement of
the refugees,
but that was scrapped because of
resistance

32:19.304 --> 32:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from many of the donor nations.

32:21.306 --> 32:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if 10 percent per year
resettlement is
considered too much, what does
that tell you

32:27.179 --> 32:28.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the future?

32:28.246 --> 32:32.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: This is a United
Nations document.

32:32.684 --> 32:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To issue this document, member
states have
to agree, all of them, 193.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is very difficult.

32:39.858 --> 32:45.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, there couldn't be an
agreement on a percentage
of refugees to be resettled.

32:45.497 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But resettlement as a key
solution, especially
for the most vulnerable people,
is in the

32:52.103 --> 32:56.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declaration as one of the things
that we need
to work on.

32:56.541 --> 33:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the declaration is the
preamble to a global
compact that we hope we will be
able to issue

33:02.647 --> 33:03.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in two years' time.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And during this time, we will
work.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will work on these concrete
commitments.

33:07.752 --> 33:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know if we will come up
with a figure,
but I think that what we must do
is increase

33:12.224 --> 33:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the present very low percentage.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are talking about 10 percent.

33:16.261 --> 33:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it's less than 1
percent of the
refugees that are resettled.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we need to improve on that.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just very
quickly, I'm curious
about the financial status of
your organization.

33:25.871 --> 33:31.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw requests go out last year
for $20 billion,
and only half of that was
returned.

33:31.376 --> 33:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How able are you financially to
deal with
this crisis going forward this
year and into

33:35.580 --> 33:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the years into the future?

33:37.282 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: This has been a
chronic problem
for us humanitarian
organizations.

33:42.988 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNHCR, my organization, has a
budget of $7
billion, in fact, annually, and
we receive

33:49.361 --> 33:52.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 50, 55 percent of this
money.

33:52.330 --> 33:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once again, this is another
important element
of what was decided in New York
today.

33:57.535 --> 34:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was decided that the response
to refugee
flows shouldn't simply be
humanitarian, should

34:03.475 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involve big development actors,
like the World
Bank, who made very strong
commitments today.

34:08.747 --> 34:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that will bring new, fresh
resources,
different resources to the
table.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I hope that that will also
be a big progress.

34:15.453 --> 34:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Filippo Grandi,
U.N. high commissioner for
refugees, thanks

34:18.890 --> 34:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very much for being here.

34:20.325 --> 34:26.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Thank you.

34:26.064 --> 34:40.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Almost everyone
agrees American
politics has become more chaotic
in recent

34:40.078 --> 34:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, that it's changed, and
not always for
the better.

34:43.782 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scholar Jonathan Rauch has a
theory about
why, and he shares it in a
recent article

34:48.320 --> 34:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for "The Atlantic" magazine.

34:50.021 --> 34:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH, "The Atlantic":
The article
is about what I call chaos
syndrome.

34:53.425 --> 34:59.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the steady decline
in the ability
of the political systems to
organize itself

34:59.431 --> 35:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether in campaigns, or in
government.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People think that politics just
somehow magically
organizes itself.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't work that way.

35:07.272 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to assemble these huge
coalitions
of 535 politicians on Capitol
Hill, and tens

35:15.313 --> 35:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands of interest groups,
and tens
of millions of voters, and
assemble all those

35:21.286 --> 35:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in government to get stuff done.

35:24.055 --> 35:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That requires a lot of middlemen
and a lot
of people in between doing a lot
of bargaining

35:29.427 --> 35:30.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and negotiation.

35:30.495 --> 35:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You cut those people out, you
get chaos.

35:34.299 --> 35:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have done over the last
40 or 50 years
is systematically attacked and
weakened the

35:39.704 --> 35:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties, the political machines,
the professionals,
and insiders, and hacks, and all
the tools

35:44.676 --> 35:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they use to get politicians
to play well
together.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And with those gone, you get
chaos.

35:51.683 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was it that
worked about
what you see as the kind of
ideal or close-to-ideal

36:00.125 --> 36:02.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political system in this
country?

36:02.660 --> 36:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Starting in,
really, the very
beginning of the republic, we
began building

36:08.700 --> 36:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties with political machines
and hierarchies
and things like seniority
systems on Capitol

36:15.473 --> 36:16.775 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hill.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there were people to call
when you had
to get stuff done.

36:19.310 --> 36:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Judy needed Jonathan to
vote on a bill
in Congress to keep the
government open or

36:26.751 --> 36:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raise the debt limit or do
something for the
team, Judy could call me up and
say, you know,

36:32.657 --> 36:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you do that, you're going to
get money
for your campaign, you're going
to have an

36:37.695 --> 36:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easy reelection campaign, you're
going to
get that extra runway for the
airport in your

36:42.867 --> 36:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
district, we're going to be able
to make this
deal behind closed doors.

36:47.272 --> 36:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You could do all that stuff.

36:48.907 --> 36:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virtually all of that stuff now
is difficult
or impossible.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all you can do is beg me,
and I say, why
should I do any of that?

36:56.781 --> 36:58.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just going to get me in
trouble in my
district.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here we are.

37:00.752 --> 37:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why were those
transactional
relationships important to make
government

37:07.725 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work, to make politics work in
this country?

37:09.561 --> 37:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: The transactions
allow for
compromise.

37:11.563 --> 37:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And compromise is what it's got
to be all
about when you're governing,
because no one

37:16.501 --> 37:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ever going to have a big
enough majority
to just do what they want to do
all the time.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, to get people to
compromise, you have
to give them stuff.

37:23.942 --> 37:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A famous example of this, but
far from the
only one, is the 1964 civil
rights bill, only

37:30.515 --> 37:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passed because Lyndon Johnson
bought support
from Republicans.

37:35.620 --> 37:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He went to them and said, what
do you need
to put this bill through?

37:41.192 --> 37:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republican leader in the
House, a
man by the name of Charlie
Halleck, said,

37:47.198 --> 37:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, how about a big fat
research grant for
my district in Indiana?

37:52.403 --> 37:54.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LBJ said done.

37:54.539 --> 37:55.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Halleck said done.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That bill went through.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE HALLECK (R), Indiana:
God damn it,
did I help you on civil rights?

37:59.577 --> 38:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON, President
of the United
States: Yes, you sure did.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you helped yourself, because
you all want
civil rights as much as we do.

38:03.348 --> 38:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe it's a nonpartisan
bill.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think it's a Johnson
bill.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE HALLECK: Oh, no, no, no.

38:09.154 --> 38:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to get all the
political advantage.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON: No, no,
no, no.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

38:12.323 --> 38:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE HALLECK: We aren't going
to get a
God-damned thing.

38:13.191 --> 38:14.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Is that
dishonorable?

38:14.092 --> 38:15.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, it's politics.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it pretty?

38:16.094 --> 38:17.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, it's politics.

38:17.896 --> 38:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's the kind of lubricant
that you
need to give people incentives
to work together.

38:21.799 --> 38:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And all of this
entails a measure
of secrecy behind closed doors,
smoke-filled

38:28.373 --> 38:29.340 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rooms.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Smoke-filled
rooms.

38:31.142 --> 38:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have come
to believe
in this country, by 2016, that
transparency

38:34.779 --> 38:37.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is good, that we need to know
everything,
open books, open doors.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Yes, put them in
the fishbowl.

38:39.384 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the problem with
that is,
if every negotiation is
conducted in public,

38:44.122 --> 38:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the minute one person says,
well, what
if we try this, next thing you
know, the interest

38:49.060 --> 38:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups have piled all in, and
the political
opponents have shot it to
pieces.

38:52.697 --> 38:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fast-forward.

38:54.532 --> 39:00.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president Obama is in office,
and he's trying
to get his health care reform
legislation

39:00.438 --> 39:01.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
proposal through.

39:01.706 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Obama, of
course, campaigns
on sunshine.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to have the whole
process be open
to the public.

39:08.947 --> 39:15.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He gets into office and
discovers it is not
possible to write a very
complicated piece

39:15.587 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of legislation involving
hundreds, if not
thousands of interest groups,
and multiple

39:21.693 --> 39:22.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working parts.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't negotiate that in
public.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will be shot to pieces on
day one.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what does he do?

39:27.732 --> 39:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He goes behind closed doors, not
because he
wants to, but because he has to.

39:32.904 --> 39:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you open the doors, the
negotiations often
die before they even start.

39:37.942 --> 39:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
he -- you
know, for him, it never would
have gotten

39:41.479 --> 39:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- it barely passed, but it...

39:43.481 --> 39:44.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:44.449 --> 39:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: It wouldn't have
gotten done.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We are done.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:48.186 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama's
crowning
legislative achievement came
early in his

39:49.621 --> 39:52.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
first term, in 2010.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soon after, Democrats lost their
majority
in the House.

39:55.960 --> 40:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, in 2011, the president
attempted to
negotiate the so-called grand
bargain budget

40:01.966 --> 40:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill with Republican House
Speaker John Boehner.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This time, the results were
different.

40:07.739 --> 40:14.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: We were really
this close
to a very good budget deal in
which both parties,

40:14.479 --> 40:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and conservatives, and liberals,
were all
going to give something, and we
would have

40:18.383 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
substantially reduced long-term
deficits,
reduced entitlement spending,
raised taxes

40:24.689 --> 40:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some, the kind of package that
ultimately
pretty much everyone agrees
we're going to

40:30.295 --> 40:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to do in order to solve our
long-term
fiscal problems.

40:34.265 --> 40:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The speaker of the House, John
Boehner, wanted
to do it, but he could not get
his own caucus

40:39.704 --> 40:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organized enough to back him up
on it.

40:42.507 --> 40:48.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's when I realized that
the groups
of obstructionists were now able
to basically

40:48.613 --> 40:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hold the system to ransom.

40:50.682 --> 40:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in 2013, GOP
leaders could
not prevent their renegade
members from shutting

40:56.954 --> 40:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down the federal government.

40:58.790 --> 41:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: No one wants it
to shut down,
including a lot of the people
who voted to

41:03.528 --> 41:04.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shut it down.

41:04.529 --> 41:06.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were kind of hoping that
wouldn't happen.

41:06.264 --> 41:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz wanted to shut it down
because it
was good for his presidential
campaign.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

41:10.601 --> 41:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED CRUZ (R), Texas: Do you like
green eggs
and ham?

41:12.370 --> 41:18.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RAUCH: So, John
Boehner, appearing
on the Leno show, and Leno says,
why did the

41:18.142 --> 41:19.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government shut down?

41:19.477 --> 41:22.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Boehner says something
that's stuck in
my mind ever since:

41:22.246 --> 41:23.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), Speaker of
the House:
A leader without followers is
simply a man

41:25.550 --> 41:27.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taking a walk.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: This is the
speaker of the
House who no longer has enough
incentives,

41:29.887 --> 41:33.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
enough tools, enough
organizational power
to get people to follow.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have a crisis of
leadership in Washington,
Judy.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have a crisis of
followership.

41:38.229 --> 41:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When did things
start to go
wrong, in your view?

41:41.766 --> 41:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when did the system that
was working
so great, with the patronage,
with pork, when

41:49.107 --> 41:50.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
did it start to change?

41:50.908 --> 41:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Well, caveat, I
don't want
anyone to think it's just all
the golden age

41:54.846 --> 41:56.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and everything was perfect.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were big problems with
every system,
and there always have been.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a question of
overcorrecting.

42:01.486 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The needle went too far one way,
so we overcorrected
and went way too far in the
other, threw the

42:06.090 --> 42:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
baby out with the bathwater.

42:07.825 --> 42:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of this must
have been
in reaction to Watergate, to
Vietnam, the

42:12.764 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pentagon Papers, the idea the
government lied
to the American people, so the
desire was

42:18.035 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fix that.

42:19.837 --> 42:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: That and the
idealism of a
generation which was, in many
ways, to its

42:23.474 --> 42:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
credit, very idealistic, and
said, well, surely
we can do it better than that.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They start passing a whole
series of reforms.

42:31.349 --> 42:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we moved to direct primary
elections.

42:34.452 --> 42:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We started reducing the role of
appropriations
committees.

42:37.522 --> 42:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We started tearing down the
seniority system
on Capitol Hill.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All of that begins in the '70s.

42:42.493 --> 42:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It accelerates and continues in
the '90s,
and it's going on to this day.

42:46.397 --> 42:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moving toward, I
guess, what
some people would describe as
small-D democratic

42:51.035 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politics, where more and more
people are involved?

42:53.504 --> 42:57.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Well, that was
the ideal,
but it didn't work out that way,
of course.

42:57.108 --> 43:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, the number of
people who actually
vote in primaries is very small.

43:02.046 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump basically clinched
the nomination
with the support of about 12
percent of Republican

43:08.920 --> 43:10.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

43:10.755 --> 43:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's about it, because it
turns out that,
when you remove these
intermediaries, these

43:15.092 --> 43:19.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political professionals from the
system, who
you really empower are the small
minorities

43:19.997 --> 43:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of activists who are best
organized, and either
most passionate, or have the
narrowest parochial

43:25.203 --> 43:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interests, but you kind of turn
it over to
them.

43:26.704 --> 43:28.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And has that
happened in both
parties?

43:28.573 --> 43:29.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN RAUCH: Yes.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Both parties are structurally
weak.

43:31.709 --> 43:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, Judy, this is the first
time in my life
-- and I'm 56 years old --
where, of the four

43:37.815 --> 43:45.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
final finishers -- set aside
John Kasich -- three
of them were renegades who had
run as outsiders

43:45.690 --> 43:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and against their own party
structures, Bernie
Sanders, not even a Democrat,
Donald Trump,

43:51.896 --> 43:54.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in no meaningful sense a
Republican.

43:54.665 --> 44:00.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz shut down the
government, hurt his
own party, campaigned against
his own leadership.

44:00.638 --> 44:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parties and political systems
used to be about
excluding renegades who would
never play well

44:06.210 --> 44:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with others in government.

44:07.879 --> 44:12.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now it's actually systematically
screening
them in.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's new.

44:13.851 --> 44:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very important for
my friends
who are Democrats who are kind
of thinking,

44:17.154 --> 44:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, Hillary Clinton will win,
and then the
Republicans will get their act
together, problem

44:20.658 --> 44:21.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
solved.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I say, no, Donald Trump didn't
cause chaos.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Chaos caused Trump.

44:26.797 --> 44:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be more coming
afterwards if we
don't re-empower politicians to
get organized

44:31.869 --> 44:37.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and work together.

44:37.108 --> 44:50.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight: The
14th librarian
of Congress was sworn in last
week to lead

44:50.087 --> 44:54.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the nation's oldest
institutions into
its next chapter.

44:54.659 --> 44:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown visited Carla
Hayden as she
began her new position.

44:57.929 --> 45:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It is the largest
library in
the world.

45:03.534 --> 45:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Founded in 1800, with some 162
million items,
the Library of Congress in
Washington, D.C.,

45:10.508 --> 45:16.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a repository of books, yes,
but also a
storehouse of history and
culture, filled

45:16.314 --> 45:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with recordings, photographs,
maps and manuscripts,
charged with preserving national
treasures

45:22.119 --> 45:23.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of all kinds.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The new librarian of Congress is
Carla Hayden.

45:26.157 --> 45:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did you want to take on this
job?

45:27.491 --> 45:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN, Librarian of
Congress: It's
a librarian's dream.

45:31.028 --> 45:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the field, it's seen as a
job that
really epitomizes what libraries
can mean

45:39.870 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and symbolize.

45:41.606 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this library can really help
libraries
throughout the country show the
worth of a

45:46.777 --> 45:48.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
library and a community.

45:48.145 --> 45:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's pretty
spectacular new
digs, though, for you.

45:50.948 --> 45:51.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

45:51.949 --> 45:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: Well, it is quite
something.

45:53.751 --> 45:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really makes you realize what
this library
symbolizes, to be at the seat of
government.

45:58.956 --> 46:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: While most of the
past 13 heads
of this historic institution
have come from

46:03.828 --> 46:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scholarly backgrounds, Carla
Hayden is a librarian
through and through, and a
strong advocate

46:09.800 --> 46:12.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for their continuing relevance.

46:12.136 --> 46:17.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She headed the Enoch Pratt Free
Library in
Baltimore since 1993, and before
that worked

46:17.742 --> 46:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Chicago Public Library,
a career coinciding
with enormous changes in
information technology.

46:24.348 --> 46:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: Technology has
such an impact
on libraries in the last 20
years, and the

46:29.186 --> 46:31.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
last 10 years in particular.

46:31.389 --> 46:42.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opportunity to make those
items available
online for everyone is daunting,
but also

46:42.333 --> 46:43.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exciting.

46:43.834 --> 46:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a pivotal time to think
about what
could be done with technology.

46:47.471 --> 46:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is where the
library has
been hit with criticism, though,
in several

46:52.943 --> 46:58.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independent assessments, that it
has fallen
behind, has not modernized its
technology,

46:58.215 --> 47:00.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not digitized much of its
collection.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a fair assessment?

47:02.853 --> 47:09.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: It's an assessment
that I believe
reflects the fact that, with the
largest library

47:09.860 --> 47:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world, 162 million items,
that's a
pretty substantial amount of
material to digitize.

47:17.735 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a lot involved with
these rare
and unique materials.

47:22.206 --> 47:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the bowels of
the library,
we were shown part of that
effort, a scanner

47:26.410 --> 47:32.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can photograph 200 pages an
hour, here,
a delicate Persian history book
dating to

47:32.149 --> 47:33.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1825.

47:33.951 --> 47:38.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these are still initial
steps to make
more accessible a collection
said to stretch

47:38.589 --> 47:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over 863 miles of bookshelves.

47:42.126 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In your life, in your career,
you have had
to defend libraries, right?

47:45.196 --> 47:46.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARLA HAYDEN: Yes.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have had...

47:48.332 --> 47:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why should we
give you money,
right?

47:50.234 --> 47:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: Why should you
invest in a library,
especially a library building,
in the time

47:55.239 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the digital age?

47:57.908 --> 48:04.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we found is a library's
place is even
more important.

48:04.315 --> 48:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a hunger in this
digital age to hear
authors together, to participate
in programs,

48:11.655 --> 48:14.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to just be in a place, a
community space.

48:14.692 --> 48:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I asked Carla
Hayden if she
worries about the privatization
of digital

48:19.897 --> 48:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media from companies such as
Google.

48:22.032 --> 48:28.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: It can be a
public-private partnership,
and there's room and space for
everyone.

48:28.606 --> 48:34.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I get excited thinking about
those partnerships
and the opportunities.

48:34.245 --> 48:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are so many items that are
not in the
copyright domain.

48:40.417 --> 48:45.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people might not realize the
Library of
Congress manages the copyright
process for

48:45.556 --> 48:47.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nation.

48:47.358 --> 48:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you do have items that are
available to
be digitized that a partner
could help quite

48:55.399 --> 48:56.834 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a bit.

48:56.867 --> 48:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have also
been known as
a privacy advocate, right?

48:58.769 --> 49:03.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the president of the American
Library Association
in 2003, you argued against some
aspects of

49:04.008 --> 49:06.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Patriot Act.

49:06.076 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you worried still about
government surveillance
of information, even what's
available at libraries,

49:13.651 --> 49:15.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government watching what people
read?

49:15.486 --> 49:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: Librarians were
called during
that time feisty fighters for
freedom, and

49:20.090 --> 49:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we were very proud of that
label.

49:22.960 --> 49:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were just concerned that, at
that time,
when people were rightfully
concerned about

49:29.800 --> 49:35.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security, that there
was a balance
with a person's right to know.

49:35.639 --> 49:41.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because you're interested
in what jihad
is doesn't mean you intend to
join.

49:41.579 --> 49:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You don't think
Americans need
to be worried that, whether
they're checking

49:45.916 --> 49:49.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out a book, whether they're
going online to
search something?

49:49.320 --> 49:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: The safeguards are
there.

49:51.388 --> 50:00.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are measures in place that
ensure that
at least the proper cause for
examining records

50:00.164 --> 50:01.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is in place.

50:01.899 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was what we were
concerned about,
wide sweeps of records with no
indication

50:07.771 --> 50:09.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of intent.

50:09.773 --> 50:15.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You look at the
country today,
and much discussion about the
divisions, politically,

50:15.179 --> 50:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
culturally, economically.

50:17.581 --> 50:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What can you do about it in your
new position?

50:19.316 --> 50:22.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: Make information
free for all.

50:22.286 --> 50:27.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health information is just about
the number
one thing that people go into
public libraries

50:27.758 --> 50:30.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and connect to public libraries
for.

50:30.794 --> 50:37.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're also looking for
information about
things that can make their lives
better.

50:37.735 --> 50:39.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a great equalizer.

50:39.536 --> 50:47.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's an opportunity for
the Library
of Congress to supplement what
is happening

50:47.378 --> 50:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not happening in many public
and school
libraries.

50:50.314 --> 50:54.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You are the first
woman to
have this job, the first
African-American

50:54.685 --> 50:56.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have this job.

50:56.587 --> 51:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do these things matter, and, if
so, how, especially
at the Library of Congress,
heading it?

51:02.159 --> 51:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HAYDEN: I'm really smiling
because of
Mr. Melvil Dewey, who so many
people know

51:08.899 --> 51:11.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the pioneer in librarianship.

51:11.835 --> 51:19.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in about 1876, he decided
that it might
be good to have women join the
profession,

51:19.877 --> 51:26.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, as he said -- and I
love this quote
-- "They can endure pain with
fortitude, and

51:26.250 --> 51:30.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they can perform monotonous
tasks with patience."

51:30.521 --> 51:32.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:32.389 --> 51:38.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARLA HAYDEN: But, more
seriously, though,
being the first African-American
really resonates,

51:38.495 --> 51:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, for so many years
during slavery,
slaves were forbidden to learn
how to read,

51:45.302 --> 51:53.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and some of the laws back then,
amputating
fingers, 40 lashes and more,
just to learn

51:53.277 --> 51:55.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to read.

51:55.079 --> 52:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to have an African-American
head up the
largest institution that
signifies knowledge

52:00.951 --> 52:04.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and information resonates with
me quite a
bit.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Carla Hayden,
thank you very
much.

52:06.190 --> 52:07.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARLA HAYDEN: Thank you.

52:07.191 --> 52:09.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And good luck.

52:09.159 --> 52:13.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A footnote to this
story: On Wednesday,
Hayden, the Library of Congress,
and the Carnegie

52:13.163 --> 52:19.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corporation of New York will
present more
than 163,000 pages, books,
manuscripts, and

52:19.803 --> 52:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maps to the government of
Afghanistan.

52:22.606 --> 52:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a digitized archive that
goes back to
the 1300s.

52:26.243 --> 52:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And online, we have more from
Carla Hayden.

52:29.146 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We asked her to pick the
children's book she
loves the most.

52:32.316 --> 52:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hear her answer in a bonus video
on our Facebook
page, Facebook.com/NewsHour.

52:37.521 --> 52:41.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a news update
before we
go.

52:41.925 --> 52:46.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, prosecutors in New
Jersey charged
the suspect in this weekend's
bombing attacks

52:46.897 --> 52:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with attempted murder.

52:48.799 --> 52:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ahmad Khan Rahami faces five
counts of attempted
murder of police officers in
connection with

52:54.905 --> 52:57.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the shoot-out that led to his
capture.

52:57.241 --> 53:01.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federal prosecutors are still
weighing charges
over the bombings.

53:01.345 --> 53:03.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:03.213 --> 53:04.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:04.281 --> 53:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:05.649 --> 53:08.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:08.652 --> 53:18.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"
thank you, and good night.

53:18.695 --> 53:24.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"
thank you, and good night.
