JUDY WOODRUFF: The December jobs
numbers are
in, and they show employers were
in a hiring

00:04.905 --> 00:10.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mood. According to the
Department of Labor,
monthly surveys found that U.S.
businesses

00:10.177 --> 00:15.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
added a net of more than 290,000
positions.

00:15.282 --> 00:20.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate was
unchanged, at 5
percent, as more people went
looking for work

00:20.921 --> 00:27.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and found it. We will hear from
the secretary
of labor, Thomas Perez, after
the news summary.

00:27.728 --> 00:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has vetoed a
Republican bill
that would have repealed the
Affordable Care

00:32.599 --> 00:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act. He said today it would
reverse significant
progress in improving health
care. This was

00:38.171 --> 00:41.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first such repeal measure to
reach the
Oval Office.

00:41.441 --> 00:45.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in a video statement, House
Speaker Paul
Ryan said it may not be the
last.

00:45.712 --> 00:50.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We have shown now that there is
a clear path

00:50.050 --> 00:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to repealing Obamacare without
60 votes in
the Senate. So, next year, if
we're sending

00:56.223 --> 01:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this bill to a Republican
president, it will
get signed into law.

01:00.294 --> 01:04.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bill had
enough votes in
the House to override a
presidential veto,

01:04.965 --> 01:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but not in the Senate.

01:06.867 --> 01:12.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also made moves
today on fighting
violent extremism. They include
a task force

01:12.739 --> 01:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to counter the use of social
media to radicalize
and recruit. Senior
administration officials

01:18.745 --> 01:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traveled to Silicon Valley today
to get the
tech industry's help.

01:23.483 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Islamic State affiliate in
Libya has claimed
responsibility for a deadly
truck bombing.

01:28.956 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The explosion rocked a police
base outside
Tripoli on Thursday, as hundreds
of recruits

01:35.195 --> 01:41.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were training. At least 47
people were killed
and scores more were wounded.

01:41.134 --> 01:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, investigators in
Belgium say they
have discovered an apartment
where Islamic

01:46.073 --> 01:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State militants made bombs for
the Paris attacks
last November. A raid in
Brussels turned up

01:51.878 --> 01:58.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide belts and bomb-making
gear. The attacks
killed 130 people.

01:58.485 --> 02:03.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, relief agencies waited
today for
the green light to enter a town
that is literally

02:03.890 --> 02:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starving to death. The Syrian
government has
now agreed to let relief into
Madaya, in the

02:09.563 --> 02:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
northwest, near the border with
Lebanon.

02:12.366 --> 02:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Geraint Vincent of Independent
Television
News filed this report.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And be advised: Some of the
images may be
disturbing.

02:19.239 --> 02:24.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GERAINT VINCENT: In the
desperate neighborhoods
of Madaya, the people are to be
found huddled

02:24.978 --> 02:31.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around their stoves. The old man
here takes
delivery of a small bag of olive
leaves.

02:31.251 --> 02:35.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Can you not bring us some
rice?," he asks.

02:35.389 --> 02:40.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the leaves are the nearest
thing to food
he will see today. There is at
least some

02:40.060 --> 02:41.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
water to boil them in.

02:41.995 --> 02:48.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't independently verify
these pictures,
but at the hospital, the doctors
say the emergency

02:48.735 --> 02:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are trying to cope with is
getting worse
and worse. This man hasn't eaten
for 25 days,

02:54.374 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're told, and he's one of
hundreds being
kept alive with medication and
spoonfuls of

02:59.713 --> 03:01.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
food.

03:01.481 --> 03:06.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laying siege to towns full of
civilians is
a tactic employed on both sides
of Syria's

03:06.486 --> 03:11.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war. It is forces loyal to
President Assad
which have cut off Madaya. His
government

03:11.758 --> 03:17.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says it will allow humanitarian
access. Aid
agencies hope to get food in
there by Sunday.

03:17.297 --> 03:20.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABEER ETEFA, United Nations
World Food Program:
We know that when people are
besieged and

03:20.867 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are cut off from supplies, that
the situation
will be bad. We know that there
will be high

03:25.639 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rates of malnutrition, severe
malnutrition,
stunting among children, health
issues, diseases.

03:32.345 --> 03:36.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know that usually the
children, the women,
the elderly will pay a heavy
price.

03:36.716 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERAINT VINCENT: Aid might get
through soon,
but the uncertainties of war
mean it might

03:41.688 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not. The time is running out for
the people
of Madaya, and so is what passes
for food

03:47.461 --> 03:49.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

03:49.196 --> 03:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Syrian
government wants
to wrest back control of Madaya
to secure

03:52.466 --> 03:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supply lines to its Hezbollah
militia allies
in Lebanon.

03:56.770 --> 04:03.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
South Korea fired up its
loudspeakers today
near the demilitarized zone, and
blasted propaganda

04:03.210 --> 04:09.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
into North Korea. The
high-decibel criticism
attacked the North Korean regime
and its leader,

04:09.549 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim Jong-un. One message claimed
that Kim
and his wife wear clothing that
costs thousands

04:15.455 --> 04:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars. Seoul resumed the
broadcasts after
the North carried out a nuclear
test.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And South Koreans near the DMZ
seemed supportive.

04:24.865 --> 04:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): No
wonder the South
Korean government has started
the loudspeaker

04:31.505 --> 04:35.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broadcasts. We cannot tolerate
those who conduct
a nuclear test, which was a
violation, don't

04:36.009 --> 04:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you think? We should counteract
it.

04:37.944 --> 04:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the past,
North Korea has
branded the broadcasts an act of
war. It responded

04:43.450 --> 04:47.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late today with propaganda
broadcasts of its
own.

04:47.254 --> 04:52.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Adolf Hitler's political
manifesto, "Mein
Kampf," went on sale in Germany
today for

04:52.792 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first time since World War
II, and demand
quickly outstripped supply. The
initial print

04:58.965 --> 05:06.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run was for 4,000 copies, but
15,000 orders
flooded the publisher. The
two-volume work

05:06.406 --> 05:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
includes critical annotations
that debunk
the Nazi leader's claims.

ANDREAS WIRSCHING, Director,
Institute for
Contemporary History (through
translator):

05:15.015 --> 05:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This edition exposes the false
information
spread by Hitler, his downright
lies and his

05:21.421 --> 05:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many half-truths, which aimed at
a pure propaganda
effect.

05:25.492 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For decades, the
German state
of Bavaria used its copyright on
"Mein Kampf"

05:31.031 --> 05:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to block any new editions, but
the copyright
expired at the end of 2015.

05:36.770 --> 05:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, police in
Philadelphia
say a man who ambushed and
wounded an officer

05:41.041 --> 05:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last night pledged loyalty to
the Islamic
State group. The suspect, Edward
Archer, is

05:46.846 --> 05:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in custody. His mother says he'd
been hearing
voices recently, and that his
family had urged

05:52.185 --> 05:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to get help. Surveillance
video shows
the gunman firing more than a
dozen shots

05:57.290 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at officer Jesse Hartnett, who
was sitting
in his cruiser. Hartnett shot
back and wounded

06:02.462 --> 06:04.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the attacker.

06:04.431 --> 06:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports of sexual assaults have
spiked at
U.S. military academies. The
Associated Press

06:09.536 --> 06:14.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports they rose more than 50
percent during
just the past school year. It's
not clear

06:14.941 --> 06:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether that's mostly because
assaults are
actually on the rise or whether
victims are

06:19.779 --> 06:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more willing to come forward.

06:22.515 --> 06:27.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street continues its slump
again today,
amid ongoing worries about
China's economy

06:27.520 --> 06:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and falling oil prices. The Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 167 points to close
below 16350.

06:36.129 --> 06:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 46, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped 21. For the week, the
Dow and the

06:42.469 --> 06:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
S&amp;P lost 6 percent, the worst
since 2011.
The Nasdaq fell 7 percent.

06:48.808 --> 06:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, a new world record
for mass
tooth brushing. More than 17,500
children

06:56.116 --> 07:02.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gathered in Bangalore, India,
yesterday to
highlight good oral hygiene.
That should easily

07:02.322 --> 07:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surpass the old mark for most
people brushing
their teeth in one place.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It makes you feel clean just
looking at them.
