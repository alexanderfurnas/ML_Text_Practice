04:16.667 --> 04:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS SOON AS THE STORY BROKE ABOUT

04:18.767 --> 04:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS AND HIS LACK OF

04:23.300 --> 04:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETE FORTHCOMINGNESS TO AL

04:26.000 --> 04:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANKEN, AS SOON AS THAT

04:27.600 --> 04:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED, A NUMBER OF

04:28.167 --> 04:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS SUGGESTED MAYBE HE

04:29.367 --> 04:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD STEP OUT OF THE PICTURE.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FORMER AND PRESIDENT CHAIR

04:32.833 --> 04:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT

04:34.400 --> 04:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITTEES WHO WERE VERY TOUGH

04:35.300 --> 04:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON HILLARY CLINTON, A COUPLE OF

04:37.767 --> 04:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS,

04:39.533 --> 04:40.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REASON THIS IS SO

04:40.467 --> 04:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT, IT IS A BASIC

04:42.767 --> 04:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL RULE THAT I CALL THE

04:45.300 --> 04:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE YOUR OWN MAN SAYS SO,-- WE

04:48.967 --> 04:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALWAYS GET IN ARGUMENTS AND THE

04:50.467 --> 04:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY THAT ARGUMENT ENDED WAS WHEN

04:52.267 --> 04:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GUY ON YOUR TEAM SAID YEAH, MY

04:53.800 --> 04:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUY WAS OUT.

04:54.567 --> 04:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PARTICULARLY IN THIS

04:56.833 --> 04:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLARIZED ENVIRONMENT, THE IDEA

04:58.133 --> 04:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS

04:59.467 --> 05:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FELT THE NEED TO STEP AWAY FROM

05:02.067 --> 05:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SESSIONS, I THINK, WAS NOT ONLY

05:04.200 --> 05:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SIGNIFICANCE BUT IS GOING TO

05:05.800 --> 05:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAY OUT ON SOME OF THE OTHER

05:06.833 --> 05:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS ON THE HORIZON.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DOES THAT

05:08.700 --> 05:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAY INTO WHAT HAS BEEN

05:09.633 --> 05:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

05:11.700 --> 05:12.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYS, THE PRESIDENT'S LATEST

05:12.967 --> 05:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCUSATION FOR WHICH THERE SEEMS

05:14.000 --> 05:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE NO EVIDENCE?

05:16.033 --> 05:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL

05:17.900 --> 05:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE

05:18.900 --> 05:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT NOW IS, AND THIS IS NOTHING

05:22.633 --> 05:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW FOR THE PRESIDENT, IS AN

05:24.500 --> 05:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTEMPT TO SHIFT THE FOCUS, TO

05:25.933 --> 05:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY NO, NO, IT'S NOT ME, IT'S

05:27.600 --> 05:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU'VE GOT A NUMBER OF

05:29.900 --> 05:31.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ON HIS SIDE, THE CHAIRMAN

05:31.967 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE LIKE SEAN HANNITY WHO

05:35.600 --> 05:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL SIMPLY EMBRACE WHAT THE

05:37.367 --> 05:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING, THE TWO

05:40.033 --> 05:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE NEVER

05:41.867 --> 05:45.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARMED TO TRUMP, SENATORS GRAHAM

05:45.167 --> 05:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN-- HAVE SAID SOMETHING

05:47.300 --> 05:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSE.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAID IF THIS IS JUST

05:49.267 --> 05:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPEATING SOME CONSERVATIVE

05:51.600 --> 05:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEBSITE'S NOTION, OR IF, IN

05:54.100 --> 05:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT, INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES GOT

05:55.533 --> 05:58.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A COURT ORDER TO LOOK INTO THE

05:58.067 --> 05:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOME OF

05:59.100 --> 06:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S ASSOCIATES AND RUSSIA,

06:00.933 --> 06:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT RAISES VERY, VERY SERIOUS

06:02.767 --> 06:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT

06:05.667 --> 06:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION LIKE THAT SURFACES,

06:08.900 --> 06:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL

06:11.400 --> 06:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PUT MORE REPUBLICANS AWAY

06:13.600 --> 06:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM A KIND OF WE'RE DEFENDING

06:15.900 --> 06:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR PRESIDENT COME HELL OR HIGH

06:16.800 --> 06:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER.

06:17.667 --> 06:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DOES THAT

06:18.900 --> 06:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAY INTO REPUBLICANS KIND OF

06:20.400 --> 06:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TONING THE PARTY LINE AND

06:23.067 --> 06:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDING BY THEIR LEADER THAT IS

06:24.600 --> 06:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE WHITE HOUSE?

06:26.700 --> 06:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK WHEN WE MOVE TO

06:28.500 --> 06:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICY YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE

06:29.700 --> 06:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE NOTION OF THE POTENTIAL

06:32.733 --> 06:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN FISSURES OR CRACKS

06:34.800 --> 06:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOMES CRITICAL.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO HAD

06:36.733 --> 06:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMS WITH DONALD TRUMP'S

06:38.667 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHAVIOR AND TEMPERAMENT SAID

06:40.033 --> 06:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH YOU

06:41.667 --> 06:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE YOU WILL DELIVER US THE

06:43.033 --> 06:45.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGENDA WE'VE BEEN DREAMING OF

06:45.267 --> 06:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR 20 YEARS, TO THE COURT, TO

06:47.767 --> 06:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEALTH CARE, TO REGULATIONS.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THE FIRST OF THOSE, HEALTH

06:50.967 --> 06:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE IS RIGHT FOR DECISION.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ARE A

06:53.800 --> 06:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF FREE MARKET

06:55.400 --> 06:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS, AS THEY CALL

06:57.067 --> 06:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES IN CONGRESS, HAVING

06:58.000 --> 06:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT WHAT

06:59.267 --> 07:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR LEADER, PAUL RYAN OR MITCH

07:01.967 --> 07:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MCCONNELL AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT

07:03.100 --> 07:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE IN MIND.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE FREE MARKET REPUBLICANS

07:05.067 --> 07:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NOT REPEAL AND REPLACE.

07:06.733 --> 07:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT IT REPEALED.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T WANT TAX CREDITS.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T WANT EXPANDED

07:13.133 --> 07:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID, OR SUBSIDIES, THIS IS

07:14.267 --> 07:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR IDEA.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS IN

07:16.267 --> 07:18.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING LIKE 16 STATES SAYING

07:18.267 --> 07:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY

07:19.967 --> 07:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID, IT'S GOING TO DESTROY

07:21.333 --> 07:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR BUDGET.

07:21.833 --> 07:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THOSE REPUBLICANS SEE DONALD

07:24.133 --> 07:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP AS SIDING WITH THE PAUL

07:26.000 --> 07:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RYAN WING, IN THIS ARGUMENT, I

07:27.867 --> 07:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM

07:30.067 --> 07:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS WILLING TO DEFEND DONALD

07:32.700 --> 07:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ON THE AREAS THAT WE'RE

07:33.867 --> 07:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW TALKING ABOUT.

07:34.833 --> 07:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, RUSSIAN INFLUENCE AND

07:36.533 --> 07:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LIKE.

07:37.033 --> 07:39.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT IS WHERE POLICY AND

07:39.267 --> 07:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICS I THINK HAVE A REAL

07:41.100 --> 07:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTION IN THE WEEKS AND

07:42.667 --> 07:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS AHEAD.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AN THERE IS A

07:44.300 --> 07:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT COMING UP IN THE WEEKS AND

07:46.100 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS AHEAD.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MENTIONED THE SUPREME

07:48.267 --> 07:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULTER HEARINGS WILL BE COMING

07:49.800 --> 07:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE PRESSING WILL BE THE

07:51.800 --> 07:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE ORDER, THE REFINED

07:53.467 --> 07:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION.

07:54.833 --> 07:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN YOU'VE GOT HEALTH CARE.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THIS TAKE THE PRESIDENT OFF

07:59.267 --> 08:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MESSAGE?

08:00.400 --> 08:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS SO LONG AGO THAT THERE

08:01.333 --> 08:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THIS BRIEF WINDOW AFTER HIS

08:04.133 --> 08:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINT SESSION OR ADDRESS TO

08:05.333 --> 08:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS WHERE PEOPLE SAID HE

08:07.267 --> 08:10.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TUCK TO THE PROMPTER, IT SEEMS

08:10.767 --> 08:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OKAY.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE BEST THING THE

08:13.333 --> 08:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT HAS GOING FOR HIM IN

08:14.767 --> 08:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COMING PERIOD IS THE GORSUCH

08:18.300 --> 08:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINATION FOR SUPREME COURT.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THAT WAS A TENTH STRIKE

08:22.267 --> 08:25.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TERMS OF HIS PARTY AND THE

08:25.167 --> 08:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE CON

08:26.033 --> 08:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY-- CONSECUTIVE BASE.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATEVER YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

08:29.167 --> 08:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP, YOUR DOUBTS, THE FACT

08:30.933 --> 08:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE WOULD REMAINING THE

18:01.600 --> 18:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE WATER IN FLINT IS SAFER

18:03.433 --> 18:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN WHAT IT HAD BEEN.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIALLY MORE THAN A YEAR AGO

18:07.600 --> 18:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN LEAD TESTING WAS DONE,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEVELS OF MORE THAN-- IN THE

18:12.733 --> 18:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUNDREDS OF PARTS PER BILLION OF

LEAD WERE BEING DETECTED IN

18:16.500 --> 18:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLINT WATER.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PER BILLION.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT IS SAFER.

18:24.433 --> 18:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT IS STILL NOT PURE WATER.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT STILL HAS SOME LEAD IN IT.

18:26.867 --> 18:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE LEVELS ARE GETTING BETTER

18:30.700 --> 18:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS KIND OF GOOD ENOUGH

18:32.333 --> 18:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PASS THE NATIONAL THRESHOLD,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

18:36.300 --> 18:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MISS A PAYMENT?

18:47.967 --> 18:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

18:49.267 --> 18:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THIS POINT THE CITY HAS NOT

18:50.967 --> 18:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDED WHETHER THEY WILL BEGIN

18:52.300 --> 18:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT'S AFTER A YEAR OF HAVING

19:04.767 --> 19:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATE SUBSIDIZE 65% OF THEIR

19:08.267 --> 19:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW ONCE THAT 100% TAKES EFFECT

19:10.533 --> 19:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WILL START SEEING

BEGINNING IN THEIR APRIL WATER

19:14.100 --> 19:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLS, THE EXPECTATION IS THAT

19:15.900 --> 19:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEWER PEOPLE WILL BE CURRENT ON

19:17.800 --> 19:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WATER BILLS, EITHER

19:20.100 --> 19:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

19:21.267 --> 19:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY TO PAY VERY HIGH WATER

19:22.833 --> 19:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLS OR BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T

19:24.433 --> 19:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO PAY FOR WATER THEY DON'T

19:25.933 --> 19:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUST.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THAT POINT THE CITY'S GOING

19:27.900 --> 19:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION

19:29.267 --> 19:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO PUSH

19:31.000 --> 19:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AHEAD WITH SHUTTING PEOPLE OFF

19:32.400 --> 19:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENT

19:33.600 --> 19:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
