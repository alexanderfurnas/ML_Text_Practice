JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
a unique look at the
victims of war in Syria.

00:04.533 --> 00:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2015, Canada began
that country's largest
refugee resettlement
program since the Vietnam

00:11.000 --> 00:13.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

00:13.066 --> 00:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the last year-and-a-half,
45,000 Syrian refugees have
made Canada their home, more

00:18.166 --> 00:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than double those
admitted in the U.S.

00:20.100 --> 00:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a group of comic book
artists are documenting refugee
stories through their art.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Stefan
Labbe and producer Lauren
Kaljur have the story.

00:33.133 --> 00:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: In 2011,
Mohammed Alsaleh joined
the wave of anti-government
protesters sweeping

00:42.033 --> 00:44.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across Syria.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH, Syrian
Immigrant: It was the first
time in my life where I hear my

00:45.633 --> 00:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voice saying the word
freedom in public.

00:48.766 --> 00:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first time in Syrian
history where a picture of
our dictator is being torn in

00:56.166 --> 00:57.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
public.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I was taking that shot.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was one of the most
amazing days of my life.

01:06.466 --> 01:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: That footage
would prove his undoing, as
the government began to crack

01:11.833 --> 01:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down on protesters.

01:13.366 --> 01:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: Now
they are attacking us.

01:17.066 --> 01:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Now a refugee in
Canada, Mohammed finally has
the chance to tell his story,

01:25.833 --> 01:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the help of a nonprofit
graphic arts collective.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHON DALTON, Comic
Book Artist: Cloudscape
finds people who have
come to Canada as refugees

01:34.666 --> 01:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and matches them with
comic book artists.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Jonathon Dalton
is an established comic artist.

01:39.566 --> 01:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He usually draws stories about
fantasy and historical fiction.

01:43.800 --> 01:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this time, Mohammed's
life is on the page, a story
that begins with revolution.

01:48.466 --> 01:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: I was studying
medicine at Homs University
during the Arab Spring.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The first time I was
arrested was for filming
pro-democracy protests.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, protesters would have
a flag with three stars.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JONATHON DALTON:
Three stars, OK.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wasn't paying close
enough attention.

02:11.966 --> 02:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: With funding from
the government, the comic book
artists will work closely with

02:15.500 --> 02:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refugees to create a
massive one-page comic.

02:18.433 --> 02:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHON DALTON: This is
your story, so I want you to
have as much control over how

02:23.066 --> 02:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's told as possible.

02:25.733 --> 02:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: When they're
finished, the refugees'
story will be displayed
in bus shelters all

02:31.466 --> 02:34.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over Vancouver, Canada.

02:34.100 --> 02:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHON DALTON: By drawing
people as cartoons, I
think you can engage the
reader to see themselves

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the story.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: But it's about
more than putting yourself
in a refugee's shoes.

02:48.633 --> 02:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Mohammed, comics have the
power to animate a humanitarian
crisis many have grown numb

02:54.133 --> 02:56.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When you
try your best to share a story
about the worst crisis after

03:02.566 --> 03:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World War II, sometimes, you
feel that language is not
actually capable of doing that.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONATHON DALTON: I think
that's what I drew.

03:09.866 --> 03:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: After shooting the
protest footage, Mohammed had
no idea his future would take

03:14.600 --> 03:16.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a dark turn.

03:16.266 --> 03:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: I
tried my best to say
out of trouble, but...

03:19.333 --> 03:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Assad's security
forces stormed Mohammed's
classroom as he was writing an

03:24.133 --> 03:25.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exam.

03:25.666 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was charged with terrorism
for documenting the uprising.

03:28.433 --> 03:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: Those pictures
that I was able to upload
were all over the news, all

03:34.600 --> 03:37.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over the world.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Mohammed
was blindfolded and
shuttled off to one of the
regime's many detention

03:40.233 --> 03:42.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
centers.

03:42.266 --> 03:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the next 150 days, the
guards would deprive him of food
and sleep, chain him from the

03:47.500 --> 03:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ceiling and beat him
inside of a tire.

03:51.966 --> 03:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he wasn't being
tortured, he was crammed into
small rooms with dozens of other

03:56.833 --> 03:58.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prisoners.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH:
I survived, yes.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They managed to change me.

04:03.500 --> 04:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They managed to terrorize me.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Mohammed was
released from prison when
his brother bribed a judge.

04:13.733 --> 04:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When I got
my freedom back, all I wanted
to do was see my family.

04:21.033 --> 04:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I also wanted to say goodbye.

04:22.866 --> 04:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I needed to get as
far away as I could.

04:26.033 --> 04:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: He jumped into
a taxi and fled to Lebanon.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When you're
on survival mode, like where
you're not whole, it was

04:38.000 --> 04:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of that, that I
decided to leave Syria.

04:42.366 --> 04:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was because of that I decided
that I'm not going to risk
being detained and tortured

04:49.033 --> 04:51.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

04:51.166 --> 04:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: He would soon be
chosen as one of the first 200
Syrian refugees to be granted

04:55.766 --> 04:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asylum in Canada.

04:57.833 --> 05:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When I
arrived in Vancouver, I had
only the clothes on my back.

05:03.533 --> 05:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEFAN LABBE: Three
years on, he's built a
life for himself here.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now Mohammed helps other
refugees newly arrived
in the city, people like
Osama, who just arrived

05:13.333 --> 05:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from Syria with his
wife and four kids.

05:16.033 --> 05:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, Mohammed is
helping them start over.

05:18.833 --> 05:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He signs them up for health
insurance, helps them open a
bank account, and teaches them

05:27.733 --> 05:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how to withdraw
money from an ATM.

05:29.366 --> 05:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: Withdraw.

05:31.466 --> 05:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEFAN LABBE: But with
the cartoon project, he
wants to reach beyond
the refugee community.

05:38.700 --> 05:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: I think it's
very important to, you know,
share my story, other immigrants

05:45.900 --> 05:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to share their stories as well,
in order to demonstrate we have
this beautiful place because

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we welcome others, because
we are the positive example
in a -- in a very bad world.

06:03.133 --> 06:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEFAN LABBE: With his
family scattered across
Turkey and Germany, and
anti-immigrant movements

06:09.966 --> 06:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the size, Mohammed is
focused on one thing, reuniting
his family here in Canada.

06:16.800 --> 06:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Stefan Labbe in Vancouver.
