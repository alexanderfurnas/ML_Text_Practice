04:12.953 --> 04:14.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BASICALLY CALLING INTO

04:14.121 --> 04:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF

04:15.889 --> 04:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERLYING VALUES THAT EVERYBODY

04:18.758 --> 04:20.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE SAY IN THE WEST, THE ATLANTIC

04:20.727 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY, SHARES.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MADE PEOPLE VERY NERVOUS

04:23.930 --> 04:25.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE HERE IN EUROPE, THIS IS

04:25.332 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE A CIVIC RELIGION FOR THE

04:27.267 --> 04:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL CLASS AND MUCH OF THE

04:28.635 --> 04:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULATION, AND IT'S THE

04:29.936 --> 04:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANECDOTE TO HALF A CENTURY OF

04:32.372 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVASTATING WAR AND TOTALITARIAN

04:35.275 --> 04:36.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGIMES THAT THEY EXPERIENCED

04:36.610 --> 04:38.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY.

04:38.678 --> 04:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY WERE REALLY FRIGHTENED

04:39.946 --> 04:41.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY HEARD THIS, AND THAT'S

04:41.014 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY THE EFFORT OVER THE WEEKEND

04:42.616 --> 04:44.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CLEAR THINGS UP WITH

04:44.217 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON.

04:44.951 --> 04:45.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: DO THEY

04:45.619 --> 04:47.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THAT WHAT VICE PRESIDENT

04:47.020 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE HAS SAID, OR DEFENSE

04:48.522 --> 04:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY MATTIS HAS SAID, IS

04:49.923 --> 04:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LAST WORD, THAT THEY CAN

04:51.825 --> 04:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUST THAT THAT'S THE U.S.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGN POLICY?

04:55.228 --> 04:56.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE EUROPEANS WILL NEVER BE

04:56.730 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY SATISFIED OR

05:00.133 --> 05:02.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY REASSURED EVER WITH

05:02.302 --> 05:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA, AND PARTICULARLY NOW

05:03.703 --> 05:05.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS SUCH A

05:05.772 --> 05:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT AND SUCH A

05:08.041 --> 05:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMATIC PRESIDENT FOR

05:09.843 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPEANS.

05:10.677 --> 05:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

05:11.978 --> 05:14.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT TO A WELL-OILED ELEMENT OF

05:14.381 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS ADMINISTRATION MACHINE, IT'S

05:16.616 --> 05:19.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EFFORTS BY VICE PRESIDENT

05:19.019 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE, SECRETARY TILLERSON,

05:20.987 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRETARY KELLY, SECRETARY

05:22.989 --> 05:24.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTIS HERE IN GERMANY OVER THE

05:24.858 --> 05:25.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKEND.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HIT EVERY WORRY THAT THE

05:28.695 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPEANS HAD, AND THEY GAVE ALL

05:30.997 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KINDS OF ASSURANCES, NOT COMING

05:32.532 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THEM, BUT PARTICULARLY THE

05:33.833 --> 05:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICE PRESIDENT SAID AGAIN AND

05:35.001 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN, "THIS IS WHAT DONALD

05:36.369 --> 05:38.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP BELIEVES, THAT NATO IS

05:38.371 --> 05:40.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY IMPORTANT, THAT RUSSIA

05:40.507 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS

05:42.876 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIONS IN UKRAINE AND

05:44.377 --> 05:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSEWHERE."

05:45.078 --> 05:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED

05:46.246 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HEAR.

05:46.846 --> 05:47.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'LL SEE WHETHER THEY BELIEVE

05:47.781 --> 05:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: EUROPE IS ALSO

05:49.583 --> 05:50.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT A CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ALL REMEMBER THAT THE UNITED

05:52.953 --> 05:54.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KINGDOM DECIDED TO DEPART THE

05:54.588 --> 05:56.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E.U., THE BREXIT EVENT.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE GOT A RISE OF THE FAR

05:57.557 --> 05:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE GOT HAVE SEVERAL IMPORTANT

05:59.226 --> 06:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS COMING UP.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THIS-- I

06:02.829 --> 06:04.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THIS TONE THAT PERHAPS THE

06:04.431 --> 06:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA WILL BE

06:05.832 --> 06:07.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE CLOSELY ALLIED, WHICH

06:07.968 --> 06:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES THE BALANCE OF POWER

06:09.002 --> 06:09.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT STARTED WITH THE GREAT

06:11.171 --> 06:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC CRASH OF 2008, WHICH

06:13.273 --> 06:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRONICALLY HURT EUROPE FAR MORE

06:15.008 --> 06:16.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN IT DID THE UNITED STATES,

06:16.610 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMBINED WITH THAT IS THIS HUGE

06:19.846 --> 06:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUGEE FLOW FROM THE MIDDLE

06:22.015 --> 06:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EAST AND THE SET OF TERRORIST

06:24.851 --> 06:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS AGAINST GERMANY, AGAINST

06:27.520 --> 06:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANCE, AGAINST BELGIUM.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAS THEM UNSETTLED,

06:30.357 --> 06:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NERVOUS.

06:30.991 --> 06:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE QUESTIONING THEIR

06:31.758 --> 06:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUTURE.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREXIT, THE BRITISH DECISION TO

06:34.361 --> 06:36.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE, WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, ON TOP OF THIS, THE

06:37.631 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THEY WERE

06:39.065 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY RATTLED.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE LESS RATTLED NOW, AND

06:41.334 --> 06:42.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SPEAKING OF

06:43.470 --> 06:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REFUGEE SITUATION, PRESIDENT

06:44.971 --> 06:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF

06:46.573 --> 06:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GERMANY'S POLICY.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CALLS IT AN OPEN DOOR POLICY,

06:49.509 --> 06:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE IN RESPONSE HAS A TRAVEL

06:52.379 --> 06:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAN FOR THE UNITED STATES.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THERE ARE SOME PLANS THE

06:55.081 --> 06:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAVEL BAN WILL COME BACK IN A

06:56.683 --> 06:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT FORM TO ADDRESS SOME

06:58.318 --> 06:59.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE CONCERNS OF 9th

CIRCUIT.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW IS THAT SITTING WITH THE

07:01.087 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?

07:02.555 --> 07:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE

07:04.090 --> 07:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EUROPE WHO THINK EXACTLY THE

07:06.493 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY DONALD TRUMP THINKS ABOUT

07:07.894 --> 07:09.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL'S DECISION TO LET

07:09.396 --> 07:11.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A MILLION REFUGEES, IN MANY

07:11.831 --> 07:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES WITHOUT ANY SCREENING

07:13.400 --> 07:14.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATSOEVER.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

07:15.335 --> 07:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIAL TRAVEL BAN THAT THE U.S.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT IMPOSED WAS A WISE

07:18.805 --> 07:19.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S NOTHING MERKEL CAN DO TO

07:21.174 --> 07:23.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY REVERSE THE DAMAGE SHE

07:23.176 --> 07:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS DONE TO HER PARTY, TO HER

REPUTATION, AND TO EUROPEAN

07:26.813 --> 07:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLIDARITY WITH THAT DECISION.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A WAY, DONALD TRUMP IS JUST

07:30.083 --> 07:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING WHAT MANY PEOPLE HERE

07:31.017 --> 07:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:00.826 --> 21:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH ZUCKERBERG ABOUT HIS ESSAY.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, WORTH NOTING, THE SOCIAL

21:04.563 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NETWORK HAS 1.8 BILLION PEOPLE,

21:07.032 --> 21:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A QUARTER OF THE PLANET.

21:09.068 --> 21:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHY IS IT A BIG DEAL?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE SHAREHOLDER LETTERS

21:11.070 --> 21:12.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITTEN ALL THE TIME BY

21:12.071 --> 21:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, HE DIDN'T WRITE IT TO

21:13.239 --> 21:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHAREHOLDERS; HE WROTE IT TO

21:14.006 --> 21:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOYEES OF FACEBOOK, AND THAT

21:15.574 --> 21:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS AN INTERESTING THING.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK HE WROTE IT FOR THE

21:17.576 --> 21:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERAL PUBLIC, TOO, IT WASN'T

21:18.811 --> 21:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR INVESTORS IN FACEBOOK,

21:20.079 --> 21:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY NOT FROM READING IT.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WASN'T ABOUT INVESTMENTS OR

21:23.082 --> 21:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS,

21:24.250 --> 21:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT MORE ABOUT THEIR SOUL, THE

21:25.918 --> 21:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUL OF THE COMPANY.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

21:27.253 --> 21:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT SEEMS TO STRIKE OUT

21:28.587 --> 21:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THERE'S THIS-- IN THE

21:30.256 --> 21:31.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEREST OF GLOBAL

21:31.257 --> 21:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTEDNESS, HE IS ALSO

21:32.258 --> 21:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAKING AGAINST WHAT WE ARE

21:34.093 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEING AS A NATIONALISM AND A

21:35.828 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISOLATIONISM.

21:36.262 --> 21:36.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21:36.929 --> 21:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAH, I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S TRYING VERY HARD TO THREAD

21:38.764 --> 21:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A VERY THIN NEEDLE.

21:39.765 --> 21:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DIDN'T USE THE WORD "TRUMP"

21:40.766 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYWHERE; HE INSISTED THAT HE'D

21:42.668 --> 21:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKED ON THIS IDEA FOR YEARS.

21:44.436 --> 21:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE WAS ONE LINE, I

21:45.271 --> 21:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, IN THE THING, THAT SAID,

21:46.438 --> 21:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT NEVER WAS A CONTROVERSIAL

21:48.474 --> 21:50.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING, THAT CONNECTION, GLOBAL

21:50.276 --> 21:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTION WAS CONTROVERSIAL,

21:52.311 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY.

21:53.179 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, BY SAYING THAT, YOU ARE

21:55.681 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING, WHY IS CONNECTION

21:57.049 --> 21:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF

22:00.553 --> 22:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ESSAY, AND IT WENT ON FOR A

22:01.854 --> 22:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG, LONG TIME, ON LOTS OF

22:03.122 --> 22:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES AROUND SAFETY, EVERYTHING

22:06.292 --> 22:08.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM BULLYING TO FAKE NEWS, TO

22:08.727 --> 22:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW FACEBOOK IS GOING TO LET

22:09.762 --> 22:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HANDLE THEIR PROFILES

22:10.996 --> 22:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING FORWARD, TO SORT OF AN

22:13.632 --> 22:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBRACE OF GLOBALISM.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: FOR THE FAKE

22:15.467 --> 22:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEWS PART, I MEAN, WE IN THIS

22:17.136 --> 22:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS CARE A LOT ABOUT IT,

22:18.404 --> 22:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDING A MORE INFORMED WORLD.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS FIRST RESPONSE TO THE

22:23.175 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLEGATIONS OF THE

22:24.076 --> 22:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBILITY OF FACEBOOK IN

22:25.578 --> 22:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THIS WAS, "WHAT?

22:26.912 --> 22:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO, WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THIS."

22:28.314 --> 22:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, I CALL IT THE "WHAT IF"

22:29.215 --> 22:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHRUG.

22:30.049 --> 22:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YEAH, AND NOW IT

22:30.783 --> 22:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEMS TO HAVE SHIFTED.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT LEAST HE WANTS TO BE PART OF

22:32.851 --> 22:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM, WHICH MEANS HE'S

22:33.886 --> 22:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORT OF IMPLYING HE WAS PART OF

22:35.721 --> 22:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, EXACTLY, SO HE--

22:38.490 --> 22:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I THINK IN THE

22:39.291 --> 22:40.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGINNING HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT,

22:40.459 --> 22:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE SHRUGGED IT OFF THAT IT

22:41.327 --> 22:42.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASN'T A BIG DEAL, EXCEPT THAT

22:42.695 --> 22:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY INDICATION IS THAT MOST

22:43.729 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS FROM

22:44.697 --> 22:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACEBOOK.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO EVEN IF HE DOESN'T SEE

22:46.432 --> 22:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIMSELF AS A MEDIA COMPANY,

22:47.666 --> 22:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T SEE FACEBOOK AS A MEDIA

22:48.734 --> 22:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANY, IT IS.

22:49.501 --> 22:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A MEDIA DISTRIBUTION

22:50.536 --> 22:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANY, FOR SURE.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE REACTED

22:54.173 --> 22:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THAT BADLY AND SAID, WAIT A

22:55.608 --> 22:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINUTE.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE, EVERYBODY GETS THEIR NEWS,

22:57.176 --> 22:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOME OF THIS NEWS IS FAKE.

22:58.677 --> 22:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DON'T YOU HAVE A

22:59.578 --> 23:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE SOME

23:01.513 --> 23:03.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROL OVER YOUR PLATFORM OR DO

23:03.015 --> 23:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU JUST WANT IT TO BE THIS

23:04.250 --> 23:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOXIC WASTE DUMP THAT IT'S

23:05.751 --> 23:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOMING, SORT OF LIKE TWITTER.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, TWITTER IS SORT OF A

23:09.121 --> 23:10.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREE-FOR-ALL, AND I THINK MARK

23:10.756 --> 23:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS LOOKING TO GET SOMEWHERE IN

23:13.359 --> 23:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN, NOT TAKE FULL

23:14.360 --> 23:15.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBILITY, BUT LEAST

23:15.728 --> 23:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME

23:17.663 --> 23:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT FACEBOOK

23:18.864 --> 23:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IN THIS, HE'S

23:20.666 --> 23:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO ALMOST BUILD THIS

23:21.634 --> 23:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTIVE TISSUE, A LAYER OF

23:23.802 --> 23:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFRASTRUCTURE BETWEEN OTHER

23:25.170 --> 23:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAYERS OF INFRASTRUCTURE,

23:26.538 --> 23:27.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN-- IT'S THE SORT OF THING

23:27.606 --> 23:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN OUR CHURCH

23:29.041 --> 23:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OUR SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING

23:30.142 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSE WOULD BE ON FACEBOOK WHICH,

23:31.076 --> 23:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COURSE, IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

23:32.211 --> 23:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SURE, ABSOLUTELY.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OH, NO, YOU KNOW, THE FUNNIEST

23:34.146 --> 23:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADLINE I HAS WAS, MARK

ZUCKERBERG'S SOLUTION FOR THE

WORLD CRISIS IS MORE FACEBOOK,

23:37.983 --> 23:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:38.550 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IF WE COULD ONLY FACEBOOK

23:39.618 --> 23:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER WE WOULD ALL GET ALONG

23:40.586 --> 23:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HAVE COMMON GROUND.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE TALKED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF

23:42.955 --> 23:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLARIZATION.

23:43.989 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN WITHIN THE FACEBOOK

23:44.990 --> 23:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEM,IS THAT YOU HANG-- THE

23:46.659 --> 23:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILTER BUBBLES, THAT YOU HANG

23:47.493 --> 23:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND

23:48.627 --> 23:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY PEOPLE LIKE-MINDED AND YOU

23:50.496 --> 23:51.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T GET OUT AND SEE OTHER

23:51.497 --> 23:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE, AND I THINK THAT WAS AN

23:52.564 --> 23:53.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING PART-- IS, HOW CAN

23:53.732 --> 23:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE CONNECT YOU WITH MORE POINTS

23:55.067 --> 23:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

23:55.634 --> 23:56.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW CAN WE CONNECT YOU WITH

23:56.735 --> 23:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND HOW CAN WE

23:58.070 --> 23:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVE YOU A WIDER VIEWPOINT FROM
