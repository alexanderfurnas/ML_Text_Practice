00:59.766 --> 01:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from behind to attack
two Israeli officers,
then, a running gun
battle, seen on cell phone

01:05.933 --> 01:07.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

01:07.933 --> 01:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police gave chase, and one
attacker jumped up and lunged
at an officer before being shot

01:12.133 --> 01:13.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

01:13.833 --> 01:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: We can confirm that
there was a terrorist
attack that took place.

01:16.166 --> 01:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three terrorists used an
automatic weapon and a knife
in and around in the area.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: All this at
the holiest site in Jerusalem,
the Temple Mount to Jews, the

01:26.666 --> 01:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Noble Sanctuary to Muslims.

01:28.666 --> 01:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ancient complex includes
the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa
Mosque, and the Western Wall

01:34.300 --> 01:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
surrounding part of it.

01:36.733 --> 01:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
All three assailants
were identified as Arab
citizens of Israel.

01:41.133 --> 01:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Relatives say they
were devout Muslims who
frequented the area often.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel police quickly closed
the site, a move rarely taken
since the Six-Day War in 1967,

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the Israelis captured
East Jerusalem and its
Old City from Jordan.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Previous closures have provoked
rioting by Palestinians.

02:03.800 --> 02:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Muslims had to pray
outside the shrine after the
closure canceled noon prayers at

02:09.733 --> 02:11.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Al-Aqsa.

02:11.733 --> 02:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The grand mufti of Jerusalem
had called for Palestinians
to defy the closure.

02:15.300 --> 02:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have to enter the mosque to
attend the Friday prayers.

02:20.266 --> 02:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al-Aqsa Mosque is our mosque,
so it is not allowed, under any
circumstances, to be prevented

02:26.133 --> 02:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from reaching the mosque.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Israeli
police detained the
Mufti for several hours.

Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas telephoned Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu to condemn

02:37.333 --> 02:38.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the attack.

02:38.566 --> 02:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he also called for
reopening the holy site.

02:41.300 --> 02:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seeking to ease tensions,
Netanyahu quickly issued a
statement that the status quo on

02:47.533 --> 02:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
access to the site
will be preserved.

02:49.700 --> 02:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the leader of the militant
Islamic Jihad movement in
Gaza City welcomed the attack.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Jerusalem is an Arab and Islamic
land, so when the Zionist

03:00.000 --> 03:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enemy seeks to turn it into
a Jewish temple, one of our
people will come out and stand

03:04.533 --> 03:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the face of this
plan and confront it
as it happened today.

03:07.466 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In the end,
Israelis and Palestinians
were left to bury their dead

03:14.033 --> 03:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
amid fears that the
attack is a harbinger of
more violence to come.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in
this country, the U.S.
Justice Department says
that it will appeal

03:25.766 --> 03:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
directly to the Supreme
Court, after a federal
judge dealt another blow
to President Trump's

03:31.366 --> 03:32.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
travel ban.

The judge in Hawaii
ruled last night.

03:34.633 --> 03:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the list of bona
fide relationships that allow
entry to the U.S. must include

03:40.500 --> 03:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grandparents, among others.

03:42.566 --> 03:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

today that county commissioners
in North Carolina violated the

03:48.566 --> 03:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Constitution by starting
meetings with Christian prayers.

03:51.566 --> 03:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Fourth Circuit case
is also likely headed
for the Supreme Court.

03:55.833 --> 04:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ruling says prayers
at public meetings are not
inherently unconstitutional.

04:00.166 --> 04:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, in this case,
no prayers from other
faiths were permitted.

04:07.566 --> 04:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump today
pushed Senate Republicans
today to approve a
revamped health care bill.

04:12.433 --> 04:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tweet, he said -- quote --
"Republican senators must come
through as they have promised."

04:15.233 --> 04:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Already, Rand Paul and
Susan Collins have said
that they will vote no.

04:19.800 --> 04:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means GOP leaders cannot
afford to lose another vote.

04:24.166 --> 04:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president spent much of
his day taking part in France's

also found sure allies,

04:55.200 --> 04:56.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
friends who have
come to our aid.

04:56.433 --> 04:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The United States of
America is one of them.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is why nothing
will ever separate us.

05:01.533 --> 05:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The presence today of the
American president by my side,
Mr. Donald Trump, and his wife

05:05.666 --> 05:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a sign of friendship
which has endured time.
