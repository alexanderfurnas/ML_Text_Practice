JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A new study
raises even stronger concerns
about the risks of brain

00:05.033 --> 00:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
injury from the country's most
popular professional sport.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the focus of our weekly
segment the Leading Edge.

00:11.766 --> 00:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Hari Sreenivasan has the
story from our New York studios.

00:14.700 --> 00:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have
known about the dangers of
hard hits and concussions from

00:19.033 --> 00:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
football, and that many
players are suffering
from CTE, or chronic
traumatic encephalopathy.

00:26.033 --> 00:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, yesterday, the largest
study to date concluded that
110 of 111 former NFL players

00:32.600 --> 00:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who had died and donated
their brains had CTE.

00:37.033 --> 00:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These included former
greats such as quarterback
Kenny Stabler and
linebacker Dave Duerson.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers also looked at the
brains of 202 former players,
including high school and

00:48.233 --> 00:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college athletes; 87 percent
were found to have CTE.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The NFL released a statement.

00:54.033 --> 00:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said in part: "We appreciate
the work for the value it
adds in the ongoing quest for

00:58.800 --> 01:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a better understanding of CTE.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The NFL will continue to work
with a wide range of experts
to improve the health of

01:06.166 --> 01:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
current and former
NFL athletes."

01:09.333 --> 01:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Alosco is a co-author
of the study from the Boston
University CTE Center.

01:13.766 --> 01:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Michael, thanks for joining us.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You and your researchers point
out that this is not a random
sample, that the group of

01:19.566 --> 01:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brains that you were studying
either came directly from
the athletes or from members

01:23.633 --> 01:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of their family who thought
there might be something wrong.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That said, what does this
information tell you?

01:29.233 --> 01:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does this data point to?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO, Boston
University CTE Center:
This is the largest case
series study to date

01:33.833 --> 01:35.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of CTE.

01:35.066 --> 01:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, it's among
football players.

01:38.200 --> 01:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The sheer numbers, the sheer
size of the individuals who
had CTE is really concerning.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really suggesting a link
between prior participation
in football and CTE.

01:52.533 --> 01:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really going to serve as
a foundation, as a rich data
source going forward to really

01:57.166 --> 02:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
study this disease and
figuring out what causes
it and identifying the
risk factors and to

02:03.766 --> 02:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really better understand it.

02:05.433 --> 02:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Help
us understand what
CTE does to the brain.

02:08.966 --> 02:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: It's a
neurodegenerative disease,
so a neurodegenerative
disease similar to

02:13.633 --> 02:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alzheimer's, but it's
very distinct from
Alzheimer's disease.

02:18.066 --> 02:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What we see in CTE is
this protein called tau.

02:21.566 --> 02:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tau is a protein that helps
stabilize the cell, but in
CTE, it becomes abnormal.

02:28.100 --> 02:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, specifically, it
starts to collect around
the blood vessels.

02:32.566 --> 02:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's located at the base of
the (INAUDIBLE) kind of right
below the bottom of the tissue

02:39.600 --> 02:41.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the brain.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's a really
unique presentation.

02:43.666 --> 02:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Michael,
I know you sent us a slide.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to put
that on the screen.

02:49.466 --> 02:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the left-hand side, you kind
of see a cross-section of a
brain that's almost off-white.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then, on the
right-hand side, you see
a lot more dark edges.

02:56.666 --> 02:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that, I suppose,
is where the CTE is.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what -- how does this
affect a player's behavior?

03:00.866 --> 03:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: We see
a lot of different types
of symptoms in CTE.

03:05.133 --> 03:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of them are nonspecific,
meaning that, you know, we see
these symptoms across various

03:09.633 --> 03:11.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conditions.

03:11.766 --> 03:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, in CTE, we're
commonly seeing behavior
changes, so we're seeing
aggressive behaviors,

03:16.466 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
violent behaviors.

03:18.066 --> 03:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're seeing changes in
mood, like depression.

03:21.033 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're also seeing changes
in thinking and memory.

03:25.100 --> 03:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we need to identify is what
symptoms are specific to CTE.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by doing that, it will
help us diagnose CTE in life
and really characterize it.

03:34.433 --> 03:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things I found interesting was
that you actually found this

03:38.400 --> 03:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in high school players.

03:40.533 --> 03:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that means that this
wasn't just the big-time NFL
superstars that were hitting

03:44.733 --> 03:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
each other with tremendous
force, but does this
have a cumulative effect?

03:48.566 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: That was
actually really surprising
to us as well is, we're
finding CTE kind of

03:52.733 --> 03:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the levels of play going
from high school up to the
people who play professionally,

03:57.366 --> 03:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as you mentioned.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we don't know how
much is too much yet.

04:02.766 --> 04:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we don't know
what it means if you just
play high school football.

04:05.666 --> 04:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know what that means
in terms of risk for CTE.

04:08.066 --> 04:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We did find it in
three individuals.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need to, you know,
identify those people
and follow them over
time to see what happens

04:15.000 --> 04:17.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
that, while this is obviously
the gold standard, you have

04:20.166 --> 04:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone's brain to
work with, but that's,
unfortunately, posthumously.

04:23.266 --> 04:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is there anything that
science is doing now to
be able to detect and
diagnose and intervene

04:29.133 --> 04:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while a player is still alive?

04:31.133 --> 04:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: Right now, we
can only diagnose CTE after
death, as you mentioned.

04:34.866 --> 04:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our work at Boston University
is also, though, studying living
subjects, and we're trying

04:41.766 --> 04:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to identify tools that look
at the brain, that look at
different proteins in the blood,

04:46.466 --> 04:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to identify these tools
that can detect CTE in life.

04:50.300 --> 04:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're really hopeful that,
you know, in the next five
or seven years, we will make

04:54.566 --> 04:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of progress on that front.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's important
to point out you're not
just focused on NFL players.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have actually the
brains of athletes from
other sports as well?

05:02.066 --> 05:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: Right.

05:03.733 --> 05:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, the paper that we're
talking about is all
about football players.

05:07.133 --> 05:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, really, it's a brain bank
for all individuals who had some
type of exposure to repetitive

05:13.500 --> 05:15.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
head impacts.

05:15.633 --> 05:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I think one
of the questions that parents
want to know is, should I pull

05:18.200 --> 05:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my child out of football?

05:20.200 --> 05:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: So,
that's the million-dollar
question we always get.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a very tough question,
and the reason being is, we
know there's a lot of benefits

05:29.566 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
associated with playing sports
and participating in sports.

05:33.833 --> 05:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this study and our findings,
they raise a lot of concern.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we need to do
more future research.

05:40.833 --> 05:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to know more about the
disease, more about the risk
factors for the disease before

05:44.766 --> 05:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can really make any
informed recommendations
about policy or about safety.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need to learn more.

05:52.566 --> 05:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Michael Alosco, thanks so
much for joining us today.

05:54.733 --> 05:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ALOSCO: Thank
you for having me.
