JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.075 --> 00:12.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
In Syria's rebel-held city of
Aleppo, at least

00:12.112 --> 00:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
27 are dead after an airstrike
that hit a
Doctors Without Borders
hospital, further

00:17.551 --> 00:19.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
threatening a fragile
cease-fire.

00:19.386 --> 00:23.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
As the presidential primaries
enter the final

00:23.790 --> 00:28.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stretch, we look at the race for
delegates
and preview next week's primary
in Indiana.

00:28.795 --> 00:34.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And backlash in
North Carolina
-- how the new state law
requiring people

00:34.468 --> 00:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to use bathrooms of their birth
gender has
set off a business boycott.

00:38.839 --> 00:44.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MOORE, Industry Consultant:
Our Series
A funding is several million
dollars, and

00:44.044 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that money could be here in
North Carolina.
And we made a decision it's
going to Florida.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.351 --> 00:55.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.756 --> 01:08.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Death rained
down on Syria's
largest city today. At least 60
people were

01:08.802 --> 01:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed, nearly half of them at a
hospital.
It was the starkest evidence yet
that a two-month-old

01:14.007 --> 01:17.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
truce is now history.

01:17.811 --> 01:26.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chaos in the darkness of Aleppo.
An airstrike
smashed this hospital supported
by the Red

01:26.119 --> 01:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cross and Doctors Without
Borders in a rebel-held
section of the city, among the
dead, one of

01:31.625 --> 01:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the region's last remaining
pediatricians.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM TAYLOR, Doctors Without
Borders: This
was a place for women to go and
give birth.

01:36.463 --> 01:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a place for children to
go and get
specialist treatment. It's now a
pile of rubble.

01:40.701 --> 01:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After sunrise,
more strikes
hit a residential neighborhood,
and rescue

01:45.238 --> 01:47.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
workers scrambled to pull a
young girl free.

01:47.941 --> 01:53.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Here
is a residential
area. They are striking at
residents. They

01:53.580 --> 01:55.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are no terrorists here.

01:55.382 --> 01:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At the same
time, Syrian
state media reported at least
1,000 mortar

01:59.553 --> 02:05.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rounds and rockets were fired
into government-held
areas of Aleppo. The attacks
punctuate the

02:05.492 --> 02:08.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collapse of a cease-fire in the
country's
largest city.

02:08.862 --> 02:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truce is also hanging by a
thread in Homs,
where an aid convoy was hit this
week. For

02:14.835 --> 02:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its part, Russia denied its
warplanes carried
out the hospital bombing in
Aleppo. Instead,

02:20.941 --> 02:25.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Washington, a State
Department spokesman
said all signs point to the
Syrian military.

02:25.112 --> 02:28.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, State Department
Spokesman: The
indications that we have now --
and, again,

02:28.882 --> 02:33.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this just happened -- are that
these were
-- that these strikes were
conducted by the

02:33.320 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regime.

02:35.188 --> 02:38.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in a
statement, Secretary
of State John Kerry insisted
Russia use its

02:38.525 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
influence on President Bashar
al-Assad to
stop the attacks.

02:42.863 --> 02:48.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main Syrian opposition group
joined in,
from Turkey, blaming Moscow and
Damascus for

02:48.068 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the resumption of fighting.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANAS AL-ABDEH, President, Syrian
National
Coalition: The regime, along
with the Russians,

02:51.772 --> 03:00.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are burying the cessation of
hostilities by
committing crimes and massacres
across Syria.

03:00.213 --> 03:05.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the U.N.'s
special envoy
for Syria, Staffan de Mistura,
emerged in

03:05.052 --> 03:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Geneva to say the cease-fire is
still alive,
but barely. He urged the United
States and

03:10.991 --> 03:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia to salvage the truce and
bring the
warring parties back to the
table.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: The Russian
Federation and

03:17.697 --> 03:25.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S., as you remember, had a
very strong
initiative which produced
basically a miracle,

03:25.972 --> 03:33.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that produced the feeling of
hope, unexpected
hope. We need to be urgently
revitalized.

03:33.680 --> 03:39.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was also
a dire warning
from the head of the U.N.'s
humanitarian task

03:39.986 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force. He spoke of catastrophic
deterioration
in Aleppo.

03:43.390 --> 03:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The lifeline to hundreds of
thousands,
if not millions of people that
have had hopes

03:52.299 --> 03:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that things would really get
better now, that
lifeline may be broken.

03:57.737 --> 04:02.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Adding to the
warning, the
International Red Cross reported
stocks of

04:02.876 --> 04:08.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food and medicine in Aleppo will
run out soon,
and the resurgence of fighting
makes it impossible

04:08.381 --> 04:09.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to bring in more.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will hear from Doctors
Without Borders
after the news summary.

04:13.854 --> 04:18.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: There's
word that 16 U.S. military
personnel, including

04:18.925 --> 04:24.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a general, have been disciplined
over the
mistaken bombing of a hospital
in Afghanistan.

04:24.297 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The facility in the city of
Kunduz was also
run by Doctors Without Borders.
The airstrike

04:30.036 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
last year left 42 people dead.

04:32.739 --> 04:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. officials say the service
members received
administrative punishments, but
will not face

04:38.078 --> 04:42.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
criminal charges. A full
Pentagon report is
expected tomorrow.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Vice President
Biden made
an unannounced visit to Iraq
today, hoping

04:45.919 --> 04:50.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to resolve a political crisis.
He touched
down in Baghdad on a mission to
urge Iraqi

04:50.257 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders to set aside their
differences, and
focus on fighting Islamic State
militants.

04:55.061 --> 04:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's government has
been paralyzed
for weeks over corruption and
demands for

04:59.366 --> 05:01.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sweeping reforms.

05:01.234 --> 05:05.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea has
failed again
in a bid to launch
intermediate-range missiles.

05:05.939 --> 05:10.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korean officials reported
two attempts
today. A similar launch earlier
this month

05:10.944 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also failed. The weapons were
fired from near
Wonsan, and have the range to
reach U.S. bases

05:18.251 --> 05:20.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Asia and the Pacific.

05:20.053 --> 05:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A United Nations spokesman
called today for
the launches to stop. And
Chinese President

05:25.659 --> 05:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Xi Jinping said his country will
not permit
war or chaos on the Korean
Peninsula.

05:32.599 --> 05:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President Xi's
government
is moving to crack down on
foreign nongovernmental

05:36.836 --> 05:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizations with operations
inside China.
A law adopted today says they
must never endanger

05:43.310 --> 05:49.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chinese unity, and will now be
closely monitored
by police. It also bans them
from recruiting

05:49.082 --> 05:50.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or fund-raising.

05:50.617 --> 05:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chinese officials defended the
restrictions
at a news conference in Beijing.

05:54.854 --> 06:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): There
are a minority
of foreign NGOs, that through
the means of

06:00.961 --> 06:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funds and some methods, will
manage to harm
China's national security
interests and some

06:05.599 --> 06:10.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other illegal criminal activity.
In this way,
strengthening control including
handling this

06:10.937 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
illegal contact, is something
that we should
also do.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: U.S. and
European officials
have criticized the law as the
latest move

06:17.877 --> 06:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a growing crackdown by the
ruling Communist
Party.

06:21.047 --> 06:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Volkswagen has
announced it's
setting aside nearly $9 billion
to buy back

06:26.419 --> 06:32.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or repair diesel-powered
vehicles that cheated
on emissions tests. Part of the
money would

06:32.092 --> 06:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cover a buy-back deal for diesel
owners in
the U.S. It could affect up to
500,000 cars

06:38.365 --> 06:40.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and trucks.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A rout in tech
stocks carried
away Wall Street today. It began
earlier this

06:43.970 --> 06:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week when Apple reported its
first revenue
decline in 13 years. The Dow
Jones industrial

06:48.208 --> 06:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 210 points to close
at 17830.
The Nasdaq fell nearly 58
points, and the

06:53.680 --> 06:56.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 gave up 19.

06:56.449 --> 07:01.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Australia, new
statistics
show that strict gun control
measures have

07:01.988 --> 07:09.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to a major decline in gun
murders. There
were 35 in 2014. That was down
nearly two-thirds

07:09.129 --> 07:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from 1996, even though the
population rose
sharply during that period.
Australia tightened

07:15.235 --> 07:21.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its laws after a mass shooting
20 years ago
today that left 35 dead in
Tasmania.

07:21.841 --> 07:27.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in Utah's
Arches National
Park, the face of one of
America's national

07:27.180 --> 07:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treasures has been vandalized,
maybe permanently.
The etchings span five to six
feet across

07:33.119 --> 07:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a famous red rock arch, and may
be too deeply
cut to remove.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The park's superintendent says
graffiti and
other vandalism is a growing
problem.

07:41.027 --> 07:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
the rising toll, as leaders seek
a peace deal

07:46.199 --> 07:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria; calculating the
delegate math ahead
of the last 10 presidential
primaries; an

07:52.806 --> 08:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economic backlash against North
Carolina's
LGBT bathroom law; and much
more.

08:04.084 --> 08:13.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We return to
the bombing
of the hospital in the Syrian
town of Aleppo.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
According to reports, 27 people
were killed.

08:16.029 --> 08:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With me now is Pablo Marco,
Middle East operations
manager for Doctors Without
Borders, which

08:20.834 --> 08:22.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supports the facility.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pablo, you have probably been in
touch with
your colleagues on the ground
there. What's

08:26.172 --> 08:27.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the latest they're telling you?

08:27.707 --> 08:29.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PABLO MARCO, Middle East
Operations Manager,
Doctors Without Borders: Yes.

08:29.509 --> 08:34.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we are speaking with the
head of the hospital
just a couple of hours ago to go
the last

08:34.147 --> 08:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and he was telling us how all
these events
unfolded. He explained to us
that, 10:00 p.m.

08:40.587 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday, two barrel bombs fell
close to
the hospital.

08:45.759 --> 08:50.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then a lot of wounded people
were driven to
the hospital. Directors were
waiting at the

08:50.430 --> 08:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gate of the hospitals to know
about the news
about the families. And it was
at that moment

08:54.801 --> 09:00.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the third barrel bomb fell
at the entrance
of the hospital in the emergency
room, provoking

09:00.607 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this massive killing of people.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was
actually staged so
that the people would rush to
the hospital,

09:06.012 --> 09:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there would be more people there
for that
secondary attack?

09:09.315 --> 09:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO MARCO: So, we cannot
ascertain it, but
all elements show this, that
this attack was,

09:17.757 --> 09:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you say, staged to provoke
the maximum
number of citizens killed.

09:21.194 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, tell me
what kind of
impact it means to not have this
facility

09:28.001 --> 09:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this corner of the city.

09:30.170 --> 09:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO MARCO: Well, there are
already very
few facilities working in
Aleppo.

09:36.242 --> 09:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to know around 95
percent of the doctors
in Aleppo have either fled or
they have been

09:41.381 --> 09:46.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed by bombings already. So,
every single
facility that is destroyed or
every single

09:46.152 --> 09:49.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doctor that is killed has a
massive impact.

09:49.489 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This hospital was a reference
hospital for
pediatrics and, in addition, one
of the key

09:53.827 --> 10:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospitals for internal medicine,
especially
for the (INAUDIBLE) so very,
very high impact,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for sure.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how many
people, roughly,
are treated in this facility,
and how long

10:06.072 --> 10:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the wait lines, so to speak?
There's probably
not that many options for people
in that area.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PABLO MARCO: Yes, exactly,
exactly.

10:13.379 --> 10:16.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We were talking with the
director. He was
telling us that all the wounded
have been

10:17.016 --> 10:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken to the hospitals, but, of
course, they
are absolutely overwhelmed, as
you can imagine.

10:21.187 --> 10:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what does
it mean for
this hospital to be supported by
Doctors Without

10:26.059 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Borders? What's your involvement
there?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PABLO MARCO: Yes.

10:29.195 --> 10:34.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been working with
them for at
least now three years. We have
been in Aleppo.

10:34.868 --> 10:41.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were going to the hospital
every other
week, providing support in terms
of technical

10:42.008 --> 10:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advice (INAUDIBLE) medical
equipment.

10:45.044 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last year, the hospital
was attacked
twice also with barrel bombings.
And at that

10:51.317 --> 10:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, also, after the request
for support,
we provided new equipment to
restart the hospital.

10:56.656 --> 11:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even until this week, we
were having direct
conversations and about
donations.

11:01.461 --> 11:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what
happens now? Are
you sending in more doctors into
this hospital,

11:06.032 --> 11:07.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into this area?

11:07.867 --> 11:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO MARCO: So, we will keep
supporting these
hospitals, if we are able to
make it happen,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make it work again. It's not
very clear.

11:15.441 --> 11:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will keep supporting many
other hospitals
in Aleppo city. At the same
time, something

11:20.713 --> 11:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important we need to know is
that we think
it is really important that
there is an independent

11:28.888 --> 11:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation to clarify who has
been responsible
for this attack. And if this
attack has been

11:35.628 --> 11:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delivered, some elements can
point out.

11:39.198 --> 11:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will -- there will be a
(INAUDIBLE) for
the resolution in the city
council in the

11:45.305 --> 11:52.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
next days regarding the
protection of hospitals.
And this terrible event shows us
that this

11:52.178 --> 11:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resolution is more important now
in the city
than ever.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are there any
other aid
agencies that are going to come
in and try

11:57.884 --> 12:02.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fill that gap? Who else
supports this hospital?
What happens to all those people
in that region

12:02.488 --> 12:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who no longer have access to any
facilities?

12:05.191 --> 12:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO MARCO: There's not much
more that anyone
can do until the attacks on the
hospital are

12:12.131 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
finished.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to understand that
anyone is really
afraid to go to Aleppo now.
Doctors, medical

12:17.036 --> 12:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staff, they are a target in this
war. Hundreds
of them have been killed.
Unfortunately, it's

12:22.842 --> 12:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really difficult to replace
those having been
killed in this attack yesterday.

12:27.013 --> 12:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you see
this as a pattern
now to target medical
facilities? It's not

12:31.050 --> 12:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just in Syria, but in other
parts of the world,
too.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PABLO MARCO: Yes, yes.

12:35.221 --> 12:39.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeing it happening. You
were talking
just a few minutes ago about the
attack in

12:39.359 --> 12:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afghanistan. We have had several
attacks in
Yemen also in the last month.
Especially the

12:45.665 --> 12:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most worrying in the situation
in Syria, where
there have been tens, if not
hundreds of attacks

12:51.170 --> 12:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against medical facilities. And
this trend
is even worsening in the last,
say, six months.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was that
other story
in the news today.

13:01.280 --> 13:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does your organization have any
sort of a
response yet to the U.S.
government deciding

13:06.753 --> 13:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to discipline 16 members of the
U.S. military
in that tragedy that affected
the hospital

13:12.091 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Kunduz last year, the Doctors
Without Borders
hospital?

13:14.861 --> 13:17.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PABLO MARCO: Yes. Yes.

13:17.130 --> 13:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I will say is that,
since this terrible
event happened, we're having --
asking the

13:23.870 --> 13:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. government and to other
actors that we
think really that we need an
independent investigation

13:30.009 --> 13:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to clarify what has happened in
this attack.

13:33.212 --> 13:37.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. government has carried
out their
own investigation, but, of
course, it hasn't

13:37.250 --> 13:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been independent. And we keep
asking for this
investigation to happen.

13:41.087 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Pablo Marco of
Doctors Without Borders, thanks
so much for

13:45.158 --> 13:45.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
joining us tonight.

13:46.025 --> 13:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PABLO MARCO: Thank you to you.
Bye-bye.

13:55.635 --> 14:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An unlikely
character took
center stage on the campaign
trial today.

14:08.614 --> 14:14.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former speaker of the House of
Representatives
John Boehner inserted himself
into the conversation.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s John Yang
reports.

14:16.522 --> 14:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For Ted Cruz, it's
all about Indiana's
Republican primary next Tuesday,
and trying

14:22.161 --> 14:23.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to stop Donald Trump.

14:24.030 --> 14:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His challenge today, though,
came from former
House Speaker John Boehner. In
Congress, the

14:30.002 --> 14:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two repeatedly butted heads over
government
shutdowns and other issues. The
Stanford University

14:35.341 --> 14:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
student newspaper reports
Boehner used unvarnished
language about Cruz during a
campus appearance.

14:41.447 --> 14:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: What about Ted Cruz?

14:45.785 --> 14:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), Former
Speaker of
the House: Lucifer in the flesh.
In Washington,

14:51.858 --> 14:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have as many Democrat friends
as I have
Republican friends. I get along
with almost

14:53.659 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone, but I have never
worked with a more
miserable son of a (EXPLETIVE
DELETED).

14:55.394 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
He allowed his inner Trump to
come out.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cruz fired back,
casting Boehner
and Trump as creatures of the
Washington politics

15:01.868 --> 15:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's been railing against.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
John Boehner in his remarks
described Donald

15:06.539 --> 15:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump as his texting and golfing
buddy. So,
if you want someone that's a
texting and golfing

15:13.946 --> 15:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buddy, if you're happy with John
Boehner as
speaker of the House, and you
want a president

15:19.619 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like John Boehner, Donald Trump
is your man.

15:22.588 --> 15:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump was in Indiana,
hoping the
Hoosier State will get him even
closer to

15:27.260 --> 15:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Republican nomination.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We don't have a long way if I
can win in Indiana.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If I win, it's over. So, it's
over.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:36.002 --> 15:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If we win in
Indiana, it's over.

15:40.006 --> 15:45.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Trump got
endorsements today from
two House committee chairmen,
Florida's Jeff

15:45.178 --> 15:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miller of the Veterans Affairs
committee,
and Pennsylvania's Bill Shuster
of the Transportation

15:50.449 --> 15:52.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
panel.

15:52.318 --> 15:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the front-runner took heat
for his foreign
policy address yesterday. In a
phone interview

15:56.255 --> 16:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with "The Today Show," he was
asked about
criticism that his plan to fight
the Islamic

16:00.459 --> 16:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
State is light on details.

16:02.595 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: One of the big
tenets of my
speech yesterday was the fact
that I said,

16:07.099 --> 16:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and very, very strongly, that we
need unpredictability.
We need to be somewhat
unpredictable.

16:12.638 --> 16:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As for the Democrats,
Bernie Sanders
was in Oregon, which doesn't
vote until mid-May,

16:17.910 --> 16:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Hillary Clinton was off the
trail.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

16:23.583 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After big wins on
Tuesday night,
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
have commanding

16:29.255 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leads in their fight for the
presidential
nominations.

16:32.758 --> 16:37.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To make sense of the delegate
numbers and
how they shape the road ahead,
we are joined

16:37.430 --> 16:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Domenico Montanaro, political
editor for
NPR.

16:40.633 --> 16:41.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, Domenico, Welcome.

16:41.901 --> 16:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO, Political
Editor, NPR:
Thank you, Judy.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's start
with the Democrats.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where right now do Hillary
Clinton and Bernie
Sanders stand when it comes to
delegates?

16:49.508 --> 16:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well,
Hillary Clinton
is pretty far ahead after the
sweep in four

16:53.679 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the five contests on Tuesday
and after
her big win in New York.

16:57.884 --> 17:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got Hillary Clinton
with 2,165 delegates,
as you can see on the screen, to
Bernie Sanders

17:03.489 --> 17:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,357. She is -- to put that in
context, she
is 91 percent of the way there
to the total,

17:10.563 --> 17:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to that magic number of 2,383
that she needs.

17:13.499 --> 17:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling me, compare
that to where Barack Obama was,
then candidate

17:18.504 --> 17:20.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barack Obama, in 2008 at this
point.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Yes. There
has been a
lot of talk of how close this
race this, and

17:23.743 --> 17:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly Bernie Sanders'
message has broken
through. He makes a very clear
and understandable

17:28.748 --> 17:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
message. Hillary Clinton has had
to use some
of that message.

17:31.150 --> 17:37.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when you look at the
numbers, Hillary
Clinton is up to 333 pledged
delegate lead.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is just pledged delegates.
Take out all
those superdelegates, which
Sanders supporters

17:41.594 --> 17:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hate when we talk about those,
because they
feel like they can vote any way
they want.

17:45.364 --> 17:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you look at this number
here, 333,
Barack Obama never had a lead
that was higher

17:50.469 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 114. He wound up with a
69-pledged delegate
lead. Hillary Clinton's lead
right now with

17:57.376 --> 18:02.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
333 in pledged delegates is
actually almost
100 points higher than where
Barack Obama

18:02.581 --> 18:05.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finished with pledged delegates
and superdelegates
combined.

18:05.184 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there are,
what, 14 contests
to go for the Democrats, 10
states, four territories,

18:12.391 --> 18:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including the District of
Columbia. How do
you see this playing out between
now and the

18:16.395 --> 18:17.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
end of this?

18:17.330 --> 18:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well, here's
the thing.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, at this point,
barring something
extraordinary, is going to be
the Democratic

18:21.867 --> 18:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee. Because she's 91
percent of the way
there, she could lose every
remaining contest

18:26.672 --> 18:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by 20 points or more and still
win the majority
of pledged delegates. It makes
it very difficult.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you factor in
superdelegates, it's over
80 percent, so very difficult
for Bernie Sanders

18:35.781 --> 18:39.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to do, barring something
extraordinary. Now,
when you look at the final
contests, she still

18:39.819 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has not gotten to 2,383. She is
going to have
to do that.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: There is the
possibility
that she could do it as early as
May 17, when

18:47.693 --> 18:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon and Kentucky go, but that
would mean
that she would need another 120
or so superdelegates

18:53.199 --> 18:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to come out in favor of her.

18:55.001 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are 159 that are
uncommitted at that
point, 158, thereabouts. More
likely, she

18:59.605 --> 19:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to do it on June 7,
when California
votes, and that huge cache of
votes they have,

19:04.243 --> 19:06.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
475 pledged, 548 total.

19:06.045 --> 19:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
let's switch
over now to the Republicans,
because that's

19:10.016 --> 19:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it gets interesting in
some of these
states coming up.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where does it stand right now in
terms of
Donald Trump and his
competition?

19:15.121 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well, you
can see Donald
Trump has 992 delegates, just
updated today

19:19.658 --> 19:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with some more delegates that
came out of
Pennsylvania, almost at 1,000
delegates.

19:23.863 --> 19:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs 1,237 for his magic
number. He's
over 80 percent of the way
there. He's really

19:28.968 --> 19:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cleaned up over the last couple
of weeks,
since New York, over 200
delegates for him,

19:33.572 --> 19:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just nine for John Kasich, only
three for
Ted Cruz.

19:37.777 --> 19:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really kind of amazing. Ted Cruz
and John
Kasich, for all the talk of how
close this

19:42.348 --> 19:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race has been, they are both
mathematically
eliminated, eliminated from
winning a majority

19:48.320 --> 19:50.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of delegates on the first ballot
at the convention.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Who would have thought a
year-and-a-half ago,
we would be sitting here saying
that the only

19:54.026 --> 19:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican who has a chance of
being the nominee
on the first ballot at Cleveland
at the national

19:58.898 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
convention will be Donald Trump?

20:00.800 --> 20:04.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Their hopes lie
on a second
ballot, if it were to come to
that, and beyond.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: That's
right.

20:06.572 --> 20:10.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's look at
their path
going ahead, 10 states to come
for the Republicans.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it look like for
delegates there?

20:12.478 --> 20:14.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Yes.

20:14.246 --> 20:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, and the whole game here is
whether or
not Donald Trump can get to
1,237. And when

20:18.217 --> 20:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look at some of these
states, big ones
coming up, Indiana, this is why
it's so important,

20:22.488 --> 20:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
57 delegates coming up on
Tuesday, and this
is why that John Kasich/Ted Cruz
alliance

20:28.360 --> 20:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sort of blew up within
hours of itself
is so important, to see whether
or not they

20:32.531 --> 20:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can keep Donald Trump below that
57 delegates,
or, you know, be able to win,
you know, half

20:37.870 --> 20:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the delegates or so, because if
Trump wins
57, then he only needs
40-something percent,

20:42.641 --> 20:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
42 percent of all remaining
delegates.

20:45.644 --> 20:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He gets all 57 in Indiana, he's
at 36 percent
of all remaining delegates, and
everyone is

20:50.716 --> 20:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just going to be saying it's a
matter of time.
Now, of course, he still won't
be at 1,237.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he is going to, depending...

20:57.389 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:58.924 --> 21:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He could lose
some of these
other states coming up in May.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: He could
lose some of
these other states.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at places like
Nebraska that
is coming up, Ted Cruz should
factor in and

21:04.029 --> 21:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do pretty well there, but it is
all going
to be about, how close does
Donald Trump get

21:07.833 --> 21:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to 1,237? If he's at 1,200, he's
at 1,150,
it is going to be difficult for
the delegates

21:12.805 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the national convention to
say they're
not going to give it to Donald
Trump.

21:15.975 --> 21:20.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, two-thirds of
Republicans nationally
are saying that the nomination
should go to

21:20.346 --> 21:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whoever has the most votes.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is incredibly
fascinating.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Domenico Montanaro, and you will
be with us
at the convention.

21:25.951 --> 21:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: I will.
Looking forward
to it.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Thank you.

21:30.022 --> 21:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now let's drill
down into that
Indiana primary next Tuesday,
even more important,

21:35.060 --> 21:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given the dance for delegates
which we just
heard about.

21:38.230 --> 21:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brandon Smith of Indiana Public
Broadcasting
joins me from Indianapolis.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brandon Smith, welcome.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we know the Indiana primary
is important.
Let's start with the
Republicans. What does

21:49.575 --> 21:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this race look like now between
Donald Trump,
Ted Cruz and John Kasich?

21:53.913 --> 21:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH, Indiana Public
Broadcasting:
I think the conventional wisdom
around here

21:56.815 --> 22:00.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that this was a state that
Ted Cruz would
do very well in, but there
haven't been a

22:00.653 --> 22:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ton of polls done yet, but of
the few polls
we have seen, Donald Trump
consistently has

22:05.691 --> 22:07.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lead in all of them.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The amount of the lead varies a
little bit,
but it's been between about 4
percent and

22:11.130 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
8 percent in every poll we have
seen.

22:13.032 --> 22:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what is
driving the voters?
Do you get a sense of what
they're interested

22:17.203 --> 22:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in, why is Trump doing well?

22:19.071 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Primarily, it's
economic issues
here in Indiana.

22:23.075 --> 22:26.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen the state's
unemployment rate
drop significantly over the last
few years,

22:26.378 --> 22:31.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but wages really haven't
followed with that.
It's a heavy, intensive
manufacturing state,

22:31.617 --> 22:34.320 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
one of the most
manufacturing-intensive in
the country.

22:34.353 --> 22:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, certainly, Donald Trump --
when the news
that Carrier was leaving
Indiana, cutting

22:39.391 --> 22:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,400 jobs, Donald Trump was out
in front
of that almost immediately, and
that, I think,

22:44.563 --> 22:45.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has resonated with voters here.

22:45.965 --> 22:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is big air
conditioning
manufacturing company.

22:50.569 --> 22:57.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What about this pact or
alliance, if you will,
between Ted Cruz and John
Kasich, wherein

22:57.343 --> 23:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz agreed to let Kasich have
Oregon and
New Mexico and John Kasich
agreed to step

23:04.783 --> 23:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aside in Indiana? How is that
playing out?
How are voters responding to it?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, it's
playing out.

23:10.889 --> 23:15.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen Ted Cruz a lot in
this state.
He has blanketed Indiana really
over the last

23:15.127 --> 23:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several days, certainly even
before that news
came out and certainly
afterwards.

23:19.565 --> 23:24.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of the voters, it's
been a bit of
a mixed bag. I have talked to
some Kasich

23:24.103 --> 23:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters who say they're now
all in for
Cruz, that anything to stop
Donald Trump is

23:28.374 --> 23:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they're after. But there
have been some
Kasich supporters who have said,
I don't like

23:32.111 --> 23:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how this is going down, and they
-- they're
turning their votes to Donald
Trump, because

23:36.315 --> 23:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it plays into what Trump has
been saying,
that the whole system is crooked
and rigged.

23:40.753 --> 23:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Kasich
supporters not flocking,
necessarily, to Ted Cruz.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRANDON SMITH: No.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, by the way,
you still
have John Kasich in the state,
what, raising

23:50.863 --> 23:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money. And it's not that he's
disappeared
from Indiana.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Not quite.

23:57.036 --> 24:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was scheduled for two public
events and
a fund-raiser this past Tuesday.
He canceled

24:02.908 --> 24:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both public events, but he did
come for the
fund-raiser.

24:05.844 --> 24:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
Bobby Knight
endorsement, that famous
basketball coach,

24:13.719 --> 24:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
endorsement for Donald Trump?
What difference
is that making?

24:16.255 --> 24:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, there
certainly aren't
many bigger names in Indiana
than Bobby Knight,

24:20.693 --> 24:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I'm not sure how much it's
actually going
to play into the race.

24:23.429 --> 24:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, Trump already has
the lead,
but it was seen as more of a
quirk, I think,

24:28.534 --> 24:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than necessarily something
that's really going
to drive voters to change their
minds.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
talk about
the Democrats now.

24:35.107 --> 24:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders,
I guess the
polls are a little bit closer
between them?

24:39.645 --> 24:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: The polls are
just a little
bit closer. Hillary has had the
lead, but

24:44.350 --> 24:47.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been more in the two-,
three-, or four-point
range.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what's
driving that race?

24:49.855 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: The same sort of
issues, economics,
manufacturing. We -- Hillary
hasn't spent

24:55.861 --> 24:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of time in the state,
really only one
day, this past Tuesday.

24:59.331 --> 25:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when she was here, she spent
her time
in Northern Indiana visiting two
different

25:04.670 --> 25:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factories up there, a steel
company and a
vehicle manufacturer. So you can
tell that's

25:09.708 --> 25:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where she's focused and that's
where a lot
of voters are focused.

25:12.311 --> 25:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
Bernie Sanders?
What have you seen of him, what
kind of crowds,

25:16.248 --> 25:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what kind of interest in his
candidacy?

25:18.150 --> 25:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Well, certainly a
lot of interest.
He has visited two biggest
university campuses

25:22.421 --> 25:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so far, the two biggest in the
state, Purdue
and Indiana University, mostly
young people

25:27.426 --> 25:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at those crowds, huge crowds
certainly. And
he was getting them fired up, as
fired up

25:31.864 --> 25:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as any crowd you will see
outside of a Donald
Trump event.

25:34.733 --> 25:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Brandon
Smith, what about
in terms of organization, money?
Who has got

25:40.639 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state, would you say, better
wired for
their campaign?

25:43.876 --> 25:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: That's tough to
say. Certainly,
in terms of money, the Cruz
campaign has spent

25:48.781 --> 25:52.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most on the Republican side
and Hillary
ha spent the most on the
Democratic side.

25:52.684 --> 25:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at organization,
maybe Hillary
has been the best. But in terms
of statewide

25:58.090 --> 26:01.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization, Donald Trump has
been fairly
good, which we haven't always
seen in a lot

26:01.527 --> 26:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of other states. But in terms of
working with
the press at least, they have
probably the

26:05.764 --> 26:07.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
best.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Indiana is not a
state that's
used to getting a lot of
attention in the

26:10.169 --> 26:15.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
primary period. How much
interest is there
in these primaries?

26:15.641 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: There's been a
ton.

26:18.210 --> 26:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you just said, this is just
something that
Indiana isn't used to. We had it
in 2008 on

26:22.748 --> 26:26.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic side. It's been a
lot longer
than that that we have had it on
the Republican

26:26.351 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side. And we don't even know
when the last
time both parties were
competitive in the

26:31.290 --> 26:33.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state in the same time.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have seen it in the
crowds. You feel
it in the crowds, that they're
just so excited

26:36.628 --> 26:39.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to see any presidential
candidate actually
spending time in Indiana.

26:39.665 --> 26:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're sure
all going
to be watching on Tuesday night.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brandon Smith with Indiana
Public Broadcasting,
we thank you.

26:47.139 --> 26:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRANDON SMITH: Thank you.

26:52.211 --> 27:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

27:01.286 --> 27:07.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
Justice Department's
new plan to help ex-convicts
reenter society;

27:07.092 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a biologist who says we should
set aside half
the Earth for conservation; and
how to be

27:13.699 --> 27:15.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unapologetically black.

27:15.634 --> 27:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, there's been no
letup in the anger,
battles and protests in North
Carolina over

27:20.339 --> 27:26.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its new LGBT bathroom law. The
fallout is
not just political, but
increasingly financial,

27:26.345 --> 27:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the backlash among business
and companies
keeps growing.

27:30.549 --> 27:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Roben
Farzad filed this
report from North Carolina for
our weekly

27:34.119 --> 27:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series Making Sense, which airs
every Thursday.

27:36.855 --> 27:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: High Point Market,
the biannual
furniture trade show, is the
biggest in the

27:41.727 --> 27:44.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world, with almost 12 million
square feet
of show space.

27:44.396 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCHELL GOLD, Manufacturer:
This is one of
our most interesting and
exciting new pieces.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the Sophia collection
with the Duke
chairs.

27:51.737 --> 27:56.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Here,
manufacturers like Mitchell
Gold preview new products to
retailers and

27:56.408 --> 28:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
designers, that is, if they show
up. Weeks
before market, the North
Carolina legislature

28:02.047 --> 28:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed House Bill 2, directing
people to use
public bathrooms that match the
gender on

28:08.387 --> 28:10.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their birth certificate.

28:10.155 --> 28:14.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also excludes gay and
transgender people
from state anti-discrimination
protections.

28:14.793 --> 28:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In response, some customers
boycotted High
Point Market.

28:18.096 --> 28:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCHELL GOLD: It's not just
that the attendance
is down. It's the buying power's
down. Williams-Sonoma,

28:23.535 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who owns Pottery Barn and West
Elm, they're
not coming to market. And what I
have asked

28:27.306 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people to do is, buycott,
B-U-Y-C-O-T-T, us
at the market, because we're a
company that

28:33.812 --> 28:35.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn't support this
legislation.

28:35.714 --> 28:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: The economic
stakes at High
Point are, well, high. According
to Duke University's

28:40.085 --> 28:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lukas Brun, the market generates
over $5 billion
a year making it North
Carolina's biggest

28:45.657 --> 28:47.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
money-maker.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUKAS BRUN, Duke University: And
$600 million
out of that is from visitor and
tourism. And

28:50.462 --> 28:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so take 10 percent off of the
market, and
then suddenly you lose $60
million.

28:55.734 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Industry
consultant Mike Moore
had planned to be here four
days, but cut

29:00.973 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his trip to just one night. He
thinks even
more firms will boycott the next
market in

29:05.043 --> 29:06.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fall.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MOORE, Industry Consultant:
This happened
much too close to market. People
couldn't

29:08.580 --> 29:13.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pull out. Most people, their
goods for these
exhibits were already here. They
had already

29:13.151 --> 29:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived and were ready to be set
up into displays.
They signed their contract six
months ago.

29:18.690 --> 29:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they paid in full when they
signed those
contracts. There was no reaction
time.

29:22.961 --> 29:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Still, signs of
opposition to
HB2 were on display. Moore,
who's based in

29:28.500 --> 29:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Asheville, North Carolina, has
opted to start
a new firm out of state.

29:31.970 --> 29:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MOORE: Our Series A funding
is several
million dollars, and that money
could be here

29:36.608 --> 29:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in North Carolina. And we made a
decision
it's going to Florida. I don't
love Florida

29:42.381 --> 29:42.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
particularly.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:44.483 --> 29:47.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MOORE: I mean, I sweat the
whole time
I'm there, but North Carolina as
a whole is

29:47.753 --> 29:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a progressive state. And
that's why I
unfortunately say it is the
money that will

29:52.891 --> 29:54.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make the difference.

29:54.726 --> 29:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Of course, the
business backlash
to HB2 goes beyond High Point.
Almost 200

29:58.897 --> 30:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
executives have called for a
repeal. PayPal
scrapped plans for a new
operations center

30:04.302 --> 30:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 400 new jobs, while canceled
conventions
have cost the state some $8
million and counting.

30:12.444 --> 30:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there are the shows
that didn't go
on, from the Boss, to Cirque du
Soleil, to

30:20.018 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pearl Jam, and Ringo Starr.

30:23.622 --> 30:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD WEINBRECHT, Mayor of
Cary, North Carolina:
I was very much a Beatles fan,
and I was looking

30:27.459 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forward to seeing Ringo Starr.

30:29.261 --> 30:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: But an even bigger
blow to mayor
Harold Weinbrecht of Cary, North
Carolina,

30:33.198 --> 30:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deutsche Bank's decision to
freeze 250 new
jobs at this software
development center.

30:38.103 --> 30:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD WEINBRECHT: We have
rumors of other
companies looking at not coming
here, putting

30:44.109 --> 30:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs on hold in the future, and
that's the
biggest concern. Who's in the
pipeline that

30:48.947 --> 30:55.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we don't know about that had
Cary and someone
else in their minds, and now are
giving second

30:55.187 --> 30:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought to that, well, maybe
that's not the
best place for us?

30:58.390 --> 31:03.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: State lawmakers
passed HB2 to
nullify a Charlotte ordinance
permitting people

31:03.295 --> 31:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to use public bathrooms based on
their gender
identity.

31:06.932 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dan Forest is North Carolina's
lieutenant
governor.

31:10.135 --> 31:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. GOV. DAN FOREST (R), North
Carolina: It
would allow any man to go into
any women's

31:13.772 --> 31:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restroom, girls' locker room,
women's shower,
girls' shower facility, and be
able to get

31:20.112 --> 31:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away with it. We have seen that
happen in
Washington state that has a
similar ordinance.

31:23.882 --> 31:28.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If we're not willing to
stand now, 20
years from now, my kids aren't
going to be

31:28.954 --> 31:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
able to stand. They're going to
go to jail.

31:31.056 --> 31:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: So, Forest and
other backers
insist HB2 must be upheld for
safety's sake,

31:36.094 --> 31:37.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no matter what the cost.

31:37.963 --> 31:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. GOV. DAN FOREST: The life
and the protection
of one woman, one child related
to this is

31:41.366 --> 31:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so important, you can't put a
price tag on
it.

31:43.201 --> 31:47.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Besides,
conservative lobbyist
Tami Fitzgerald says almost 400
companies

31:47.506 --> 31:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have signed a letter of support
for HB2. But
we could not find a firm to talk
to us.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMI FITZGERALD, Conservative
Lobbyist: The
press has intensely badgered
these people.

31:55.781 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These businesses get bullied by
the other
side, and they get threatened,
and they just

31:59.518 --> 32:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't want to go through the
hassle.

32:01.319 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: North Carolinians
have mixed
views on HB2; 38 percent support
it in general,

32:06.424 --> 32:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but more than half believe
people should use
the bathroom of their birth.

32:09.494 --> 32:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB PAGE, Owner, Replacements
LTD.: This plays
out very well in the rural areas
of North

32:14.132 --> 32:16.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolina.

32:16.134 --> 32:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Bob Page is the
owner of Greensboro-based
tableware retailer Replacements
LTD. He's

32:19.437 --> 32:24.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long championed LGBT rights and
has been vocal
in his opposition to HB2. But
his advocacy

32:24.976 --> 32:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has driven some patrons away.

32:26.812 --> 32:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB PAGE: We have had hundreds
of customers
who say they will no longer do
business with

32:30.882 --> 32:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, one who voiced, you know,
about his Christianity,
and that he hoped that the
cesspool of sin

32:39.391 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that San Francisco is, where our
brethren
gay and lesbians live, that he
hopes that

32:46.565 --> 32:51.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will slide into the ocean
after a catastrophic
earthquake.

32:51.269 --> 32:56.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought, you know, those
just don't
sound like very Christian views
to me.

32:56.274 --> 33:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Page has a number
of transgender
employees who are directly
affected by HB2;

33:02.280 --> 33:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
24-year-old Ty Little hasn't
used the men's
room since she was 17.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TY LITTLE, Replacements LTD.: I
remember,
specifically I was at a
bookstore, and I went

33:08.920 --> 33:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in. And someone saw me go in and
then mentioned
to a manager, and they
approached me about

33:13.992 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, and told me not to do that
in the future.
And so I -- it worries me a lot,
for my safety.

33:22.601 --> 33:26.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBEN FARZAD: Page hired
20-year-old college
student Payton McGarry part-time
after he

33:27.005 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was fired from another position.

33:28.773 --> 33:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAYTON MCGARRY, Replacements
LTD.: I have
lost three jobs because I'm a
transgender

33:30.942 --> 33:32.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: McGarry has joined
a lawsuit
challenging the
constitutionality of HB2.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell me how this law affects
your day to day.

33:38.049 --> 33:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAYTON MCGARRY: I can walk into
any business
now and they can say, oh, we
don't serve trans

33:41.519 --> 33:43.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people. Sorry.

33:43.321 --> 33:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last time I have used the
women's bathroom
was in high school. And it got
to a point

33:46.224 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where it was so bad, I was being
verbally
and physically harassed every
time I went

33:51.029 --> 33:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a women's restroom, that
they had to
give me permission to use
faculty restrooms,

33:55.934 --> 34:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so I could avoid assault by my
female peers.

34:00.171 --> 34:05.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBEN FARZAD: Both critics and
defenders of
HB2 rallied in Raleigh when the
legislature

34:06.011 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reconvened this week; 54
protesters were arrested.
But the law still stands and the
financial

34:15.787 --> 34:17.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fallout continues.

34:17.889 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in High Point, organizers
say it will
be at least a week before
attendance numbers

34:21.993 --> 34:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are in and the effect of HB2 can
be assessed.

34:25.196 --> 34:34.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Roben Farzad
reporting from North Carolina.

34:34.105 --> 34:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Capitol Hill
today, a group
of top senators unveiled a
bipartisan bill

34:44.149 --> 34:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Capitol Hill
today, a group
of top senators unveiled a
bipartisan bill

34:49.120 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reform the nation's criminal
justice system.

34:52.257 --> 34:57.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Among other things, the
legislation would
reduce prison sentences for some
nonviolent

34:57.195 --> 35:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug offenders, and create
programs to help
offenders reenter society. The
move comes

35:03.401 --> 35:09.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time the Obama
administration
is pushing a series of criminal
justice initiatives.

35:09.541 --> 35:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spearheading that effort is
Deputy Attorney
General Sally Yates, who joins
us now.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deputy Attorney General Yates,
thank you for
being with us.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES, U.S. Deputy
Attorney General:
Well, thank you for having me.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, tell us what
the thrust
of the administration's criminal
justice reform

35:22.187 --> 35:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts are. What are you trying
to fix?

35:23.688 --> 35:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Well, we're trying
to accomplish
a number of things.

35:26.324 --> 35:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, with the sentencing
reform bill, we're
really trying to bring
proportionality back

35:30.061 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sentencing, and specifically
for lower-level
nonviolent drug offenders. And
then with our

35:35.033 --> 35:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reentry Week this week, we're
really trying
to highlight the importance of
assuring that

35:39.337 --> 35:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who are returning from
prison have just
those basic tools they need in
order to be

35:43.908 --> 35:45.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to be successful.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are some
examples
of that? What are some things
that they need

35:48.613 --> 35:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they aren't getting right
now, most of
them?

35:50.815 --> 35:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Well, just imagine
right now
that you're leaving prison. You
may or may

35:54.919 --> 35:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not have a family to go back to.
Particularly
if you were incarcerated a long
way from where

35:59.891 --> 36:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your family lives, your wife may
have divorced
you at this point, so you may or
may not have

36:04.596 --> 36:06.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a family to go back to.

36:06.398 --> 36:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you may or may not have had
a chance to
stay in touch with your children
during this

36:09.734 --> 36:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time as well. It's expensive for
people to
travel. So, you have got to find
a place to

36:14.572 --> 36:19.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
live. Public housing is
difficult. Some public
housing operations will not
allow convicted

36:19.878 --> 36:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felons. Then you have got to
find a job. And
finding a job is really
difficult at all right

36:25.750 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, but just imagine if you
have to add convicted
felon to your resume.

36:29.788 --> 36:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, just to be
clear, you're
working just on prisoners in the
federal system?

36:34.392 --> 36:36.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

36:36.127 --> 36:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Well, we're looking
at both.
We're trying to help both
prisoners that are

36:39.130 --> 36:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, but
also working through our grant
program with

36:43.101 --> 36:44.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
state facilities as well.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's a big
job.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES: Yes.

36:48.473 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, we're
talking a lot
of prisoners around the country.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES: Yes.

36:51.509 --> 36:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said this
week, I believe,
our criminal justice system is
not equipped

36:54.779 --> 36:58.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to deal with what is
fundamentally a health
crisis.

36:58.416 --> 36:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you mean by that?

36:59.684 --> 37:02.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES: Well, I was
referring to mental
health there.

37:02.053 --> 37:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's one of the problems
that our law
enforcement officers have been
encountering.

37:06.124 --> 37:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of people on the
street right
now that have serious mental
health issues.

37:11.029 --> 37:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going back to the '70s, when
many of our mental
institutions were closed,
unfortunately, states

37:15.633 --> 37:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't pick up and provide the
kind of community
mental health care that's really
needed.

37:20.405 --> 37:24.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has just snowballed
over the decades.
And now we're in a situation
where mentally

37:24.742 --> 37:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ill people are encountering law
enforcement
and going into prisons and
getting -- ostensibly

37:30.348 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting treatment there, but
prisons really
aren't equipped to be providing
the kind of

37:34.786 --> 37:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mental health treatment that
most people need.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how do you
fix that? What
do you do about it?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Well, there are a
variety of
things.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With respect to mental health,
one of the
things that we're doing there
is, first of

37:43.728 --> 37:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all, trying to train our law
enforcement officers
in how to identify signs of
mental illness.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is before
these individuals
are arrested or get in trouble
in the first

37:51.736 --> 37:53.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place?

37:53.471 --> 37:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Before they're even
arrested,
exactly, and to be able to
divert them to

37:55.273 --> 37:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mental health services, instead
of necessarily
going to prison.

37:58.910 --> 38:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, even within our prisons,
we're providing
funding and training and trying,
when we do

38:03.314 --> 38:07.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have folks that are actually in
the prisons,
to make sure that we are
providing the kind

38:07.252 --> 38:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of mental health treatment that
they need.
But, really, diversion is the
key here, out

38:11.256 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the prison system to begin
with.

38:13.091 --> 38:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have a
sense of what
proportion, what percentage of
prisoners today

38:17.162 --> 38:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have mental health problems or
other emotional,
however you want to describe it,
issues?

38:23.935 --> 38:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: You know, there are
varying estimates
out there, and I think it's
really hard to

38:27.539 --> 38:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what the true figures are,
because some
prisons will only count those
people that

38:33.578 --> 38:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are so mentally ill that they
are a danger
to themselves or others while
they're in a

38:37.815 --> 38:39.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prison setting.

38:39.517 --> 38:43.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that doesn't really
necessarily capture
the full scope of mental health
issues.

38:43.588 --> 38:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you feel you
can make progress?
You mentioned working with
police, with corrections

38:48.193 --> 38:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers. How do you make
progress in that
arena? Again, you're talking
about individuals

38:53.998 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the country in many
different settings,
local, state and federal.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Well, one of the
things that
we have done is started training
crisis response

39:00.538 --> 39:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teams for local law enforcement
agencies.

39:03.775 --> 39:08.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a group of law
enforcement officers
within a police department that
are trained

39:08.046 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to identify not only the signs
of mental illness,
but de-escalation strategies, so
that when

39:13.351 --> 39:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they encounter someone who is
mentally ill,
they can de-escalate the
situation and take

39:18.022 --> 39:19.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to mental facilities.

39:19.958 --> 39:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we can't train every single
law enforcement
officer, but we can have teams
that are available

39:25.463 --> 39:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in our law enforcement all over
the country.
So, when someone's out there on
the street

39:29.334 --> 39:34.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and they encounter this
individual, they can
then call out for one of their
crisis intervention

39:34.172 --> 39:35.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teams.

39:36.007 --> 39:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We mentioned
coming in today
from the Hill a bipartisan
senators announced

39:39.611 --> 39:45.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this revised proposal, criminal
reform proposal.
What's the administration's take
on that?

39:45.383 --> 39:48.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES: We are so
encouraged by this.

39:48.653 --> 39:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I haven't been in this town for
very long,
but one thing I have learned in
the relatively

39:52.290 --> 39:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
short time that I have been here
is, there
is not much that has bipartisan
support. And

39:57.362 --> 40:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this has strong bipartisan
support from both
ends of the spectrum and in
between.

40:01.966 --> 40:08.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the bill today now has
36 co-sponsors,
split evenly with Democrats and
Republicans.

40:08.606 --> 40:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's just a
reflection of the
recognition that the time has
come for us

40:12.944 --> 40:17.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to recalibrate our drug
sentencing for lower-level
nonviolent drug offenders.

40:17.181 --> 40:21.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, you know, as
I know you
know, Deputy Attorney General
Yates, that

40:21.886 --> 40:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are conservatives in the
Senate and
elsewhere who are saying, if you
make a mistake,

40:25.890 --> 40:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you let someone out early who
shouldn't
have been let out early, they
can go out and

40:29.827 --> 40:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commit a violent crime, they may
be susceptible
to doing that.

40:33.831 --> 40:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the answer for people
with that concern?

40:35.933 --> 40:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: And that's why this
legislation
is really targeted at the
nonviolent drug

40:40.938 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
offenders.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, any legislation is
compromise.
There are some who would like
this to go a

40:45.777 --> 40:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot farther. There are others
who it goes
too far. We have worked really
hard with folks

40:51.649 --> 40:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Hill to try to find the
right balance
here.

40:54.652 --> 40:59.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what we're trying to do is
to make sure
that the punishment fits the
crime and to

40:59.257 --> 41:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ensure that we are protecting
the public and
public safety comes first, but
that we're

41:03.828 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not keeping people in prison for
longer than
necessary for public safety
purposes, because

41:08.966 --> 41:10.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's not fair either.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you assure
-- finally,
how do you assure the American
people that

41:13.805 --> 41:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is the right thing to do?
Because there
are still people who are wary of
how they

41:18.910 --> 41:23.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
deal with, how they work
alongside individuals
who have done time.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SALLY YATES: Right.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I can tell you, I'm a
career prosecutor.
I have been doing this for 27
years. And my

41:28.986 --> 41:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus in all of this is first on
public safety,
but also on ensuring the
fairness of the criminal

41:35.159 --> 41:39.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
justice system. That's
absolutely essential
for the public to have
confidence in their

41:39.364 --> 41:41.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criminal justice system.

41:41.132 --> 41:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when individuals have paid
their debt
to society, and they have come
out into our

41:45.269 --> 41:49.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities, I think all of us,
not just the
Justice Department, but all of
us have a responsibility

41:49.941 --> 41:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give them just a fair shot at
being able
to live the kind of lives we
have.

41:54.846 --> 42:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sally Yates, the
deputy attorney
general of the United States,
thank you very

42:03.821 --> 42:05.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

42:05.223 --> 42:10.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: My pleasure.

42:10.895 --> 42:18.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next:
Scientist and two-time
Pulitzer Prize-winning author
Edward O. Wilson

42:18.202 --> 42:23.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first gained fame for his study
of ants. Through
the years, he's moved from small
insects to

42:23.241 --> 42:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big ideas, and now a very big
one, one made
more urgent by the problems of
climate change.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our profile in
his second
report from Southern Alabama.

42:31.549 --> 42:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON, Biologist: I
was just a
12-, 13-year-old boy, and it was
just a wonderland

42:38.122 --> 42:39.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

42:39.857 --> 42:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Edward O. Wilson
spent his
formative years in Mobile,
Alabama, looking

42:43.294 --> 42:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for snakes and insects in the
surrounding
delta.

42:45.596 --> 42:49.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: If I could, I
would just
do the same thing today that I
did then, but

42:49.867 --> 42:50.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it would look funny.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:52.703 --> 42:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The experience
would shape
him, as biologist, evolutionary
theorist,

42:56.908 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
naturalist, and at age 86
perhaps most important
to him now conservationist.

43:01.446 --> 43:10.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: What is man?
Storyteller,
mythmaker, and destroyer of the
living world.

43:10.188 --> 43:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His new book,
"Half Earth:
Our Planet's Fight For Life,"
takes on nothing

43:14.859 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less than the survival of plant
and animal
life on earth.

43:18.463 --> 43:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: Yearning to be
more master
than steward of the declining
planet.

43:25.903 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wilson's solution
is in the
title, setting aside half the
Earth as natural

43:31.108 --> 43:32.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
habitat.

43:32.910 --> 43:37.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke beneath the old live
oak trees at
Fort Blakeley Historic Park,
where Wilson's

43:37.582 --> 43:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great-grandfather fought in one
of the last
battles of the Civil War.

43:42.086 --> 43:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Half Earth. Are you serious?

43:44.188 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: I'm serious. I
know it sounds
radical, but we must have it if
we're going

43:51.062 --> 43:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to save most of the species
remaining on Earth.
And it's easier to do than most
people might

43:58.769 --> 44:00.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
think.

44:00.204 --> 44:03.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It sounds
impossible. It sounds
for some people crazy.

44:03.508 --> 44:05.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: I was just
going to use
the word insane.

44:05.409 --> 44:07.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

44:07.211 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: Yes, it sounds
that way,
because they envision cutting
the Earth into

44:10.915 --> 44:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two hemispheres, one for us and
one for the
other 10 million species. But,
no, we mean

44:17.655 --> 44:27.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving 50 percent or setting it
aside, patches,
some large wilderness areas,
others far, far

44:27.665 --> 44:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smaller, in order to make that
amount of reserve
area.

44:31.169 --> 44:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Your ideas on
this and what
should happen have gotten bigger
and bolder.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: Well, they
have.

44:38.175 --> 44:47.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My alarm went from yellow to red
when I read
the papers authored by large
numbers of scientists

44:47.118 --> 44:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and team efforts that showed
just how far
off the goal the conservation
organizations

44:54.926 --> 44:59.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were, how -- all our efforts
around the world
in slowing down extinction
rates.

44:59.897 --> 45:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One key to
Wilson's argument
is how little we know of life on
Earth, only

45:04.602 --> 45:10.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two million species identified
out of a total
probably closer to 10 million,
even as species

45:10.541 --> 45:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go extinct at 1,000 times the
normal rate,
thanks chiefly to human
population growth

45:16.147 --> 45:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and corresponding habitat loss.

45:20.284 --> 45:24.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservation efforts worldwide
have thus far
set aside a little more than 15
percent of

45:24.689 --> 45:28.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Earth for habitat. Wilson
would triple
that.

45:28.392 --> 45:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: We would be
taking a first
step towards securing enough
space and natural

45:34.999 --> 45:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
habitat to preserve, by my
estimate, more
than 80 percent of the species
left. If we

45:41.138 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't do this, we're going to go
down to 50
percent or more in a fairly
short period of

45:45.509 --> 45:47.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time in this century.

45:47.545 --> 45:52.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wilson is
attempting such a
thing right here, to give
national protection,

45:52.783 --> 45:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either a park or wildlife refuge
status, to
parts of the Mobile-Tensaw River
Delta, one

45:58.956 --> 46:02.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the most biologically diverse
areas in
North America.

46:02.927 --> 46:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's opposition in this
conservative state.
But Wilson is not deterred.

46:06.664 --> 46:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: I think it's a
moral thing
to do. I believe morality is
going to enter

46:11.669 --> 46:20.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very strongly into what I hope
will be a shift
of perception and precepts and
reasoning about

46:20.211 --> 46:27.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, that we really should take
extra measures
to save the rest of life on
Earth.

46:27.418 --> 46:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And who are we, one species, to
wipe out a
majority of the species
remaining that live

46:36.160 --> 46:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with us on this planet just for
-- without
even thinking about it, for our
particular

46:42.166 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
selfish needs?

46:44.001 --> 46:47.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wilson
acknowledges that the
world's population will continue
to grow from

46:47.772 --> 46:54.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its current 7.3 billion to
around 11 billion,
before leveling out. But he
thinks advancements

46:54.478 --> 46:58.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in technology will help shrink
our ecological
footprint.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what are the stakes?

47:00.084 --> 47:07.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: The stakes are
the future
of life, the future of the
living part of

47:07.191 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the environment.

47:08.993 --> 47:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mind you, we are beginning to
make meaningful
progress toward controlling the
forces of

47:16.567 --> 47:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change and of pollution.
And the other
parts of the nonliving
environment that have

47:24.975 --> 47:27.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been causing a large part of the
destruction.

47:27.745 --> 47:35.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we allow the living part of
the environment
to disappear, for me, it would
be by future

47:35.086 --> 47:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generations regarded as one of
the most catastrophic,
even evil periods in human
history, for our

47:42.893 --> 47:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
descendants to look back and
say, they wiped
out half or more of all of the
rest of life

47:48.165 --> 47:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Earth, the variety of life on
Earth.

47:50.768 --> 47:56.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A thoroughly
depressing prospect.
But to spend a day with Edward
Wilson is anything

47:56.340 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but depressing.

47:58.142 --> 48:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD O. WILSON: Science needs
to have a
goal and actually achieve that
goal. We really

48:03.280 --> 48:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to see on the front page of
the newspaper
scientists announce cure for
cancer, or cure

48:10.254 --> 48:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for lung cancer, shall we say?

48:12.656 --> 48:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What galvanizes public support
and puts spirit
into it is to say, this is the
goal that we

48:20.731 --> 48:25.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
must reach. Let's set that goal,
and let's
get there.

48:25.970 --> 48:30.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Fort
Blakeley Historic
Park outside Mobile, Alabama,
I'm Jeffrey

48:30.941 --> 48:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

48:36.747 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where

48:48.392 --> 48:51.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

48:51.328 --> 48:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Heben
Nigatu and Tracy
Clayton, the hosts of BuzzFeed
podcast "Another

48:58.369 --> 49:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Round," which covers everything
from race,
gender, pop culture, and more.

49:02.873 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Nigatu and Clayton explain,
their show
has carved out a new and
important space in

49:08.112 --> 49:10.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the growing podcast landscape.

49:10.447 --> 49:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU, "Another Round":
We have good
sound effects. Give them your
air horn. Beautiful.

49:23.861 --> 49:25.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:25.696 --> 49:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON, "Another Round":
It's not so
much that we wanted to fill a
space. We wanted

49:31.702 --> 49:33.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to create a space that wasn't
there before.

49:33.737 --> 49:37.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HEBEN NIGATU: A lot of
podcasters tend to
come from the same places, same
universities,

49:37.842 --> 49:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same, like, NPR-style training,
so it all
kind of often tends to sound
uniform. And,

49:44.348 --> 49:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like, Ira Glass is our god.

49:46.183 --> 49:50.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: I saw a comic
once, a cartoon,
and it was, like, a foot race
between white

49:50.421 --> 49:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folks. You had a white person in
this lane
and then a black person in this
lane.

49:53.891 --> 49:58.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's like you have the same
start as everyone
else, blah, blah, blah, but in
the black person's

49:58.429 --> 50:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lane, there is like alligators
and barbed
wire. We have to be like the
right kind of

50:03.400 --> 50:05.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
black for people to pay
attention to us.

50:05.502 --> 50:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't make white people too
uncomfortable
when we talk about race. And
that is exhausting.

50:12.209 --> 50:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is exhausting to have to pick
and choose.

50:13.911 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU: I do not have the
energy for
that.

50:15.045 --> 50:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: Yes. Yes. We have
so much going
on.

50:16.046 --> 50:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU: We have a life to
live.

50:17.915 --> 50:23.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Appealing to white people's
consciousness
has a rough history in America,
but appealing

50:23.120 --> 50:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to capitalism does well. Hence,
I like to
make the diversity argument
about larger markets,

50:29.960 --> 50:34.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
untapped audiences. There are
swathes of people
you are not reaching. So, if you
are just

50:34.565 --> 50:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not here for the moral reason...

50:36.767 --> 50:37.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: Then be here for
the money.

HEBEN NIGATU: Yes.

50:39.503 --> 50:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: As black women,
we know what
it feels like to be overlooked
and ignored.

50:42.973 --> 50:45.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we were finally like, hey,
we have the
microphone.

50:45.509 --> 50:48.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU: We want this to be
a space,
all of it is on our terms.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRACY CLAYTON: Yes. Yes.

50:50.214 --> 50:52.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU: We can have
conversations with
people, like even like Hillary
Clinton, and

50:52.850 --> 50:54.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have it be on our terms.

50:54.718 --> 50:57.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: Ben Smith, our
editor in chief,
really encouraged us to ask her
for the things

50:57.855 --> 50:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we really, really wanted to
know.

50:59.690 --> 51:03.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was like, you will probably
never interview
her again. You're not trying to
make a best

51:03.360 --> 51:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friend, so who cares if she gets
uncomfortable?
She had to meet us where we
were. And we talked

51:08.332 --> 51:12.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to her the same way we talked to
everybody
else. We're like, you're in our
house.

51:12.603 --> 51:14.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU: We didn't say
that.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: No, we didn't at
all.

51:16.874 --> 51:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It feels amazing to not have to
be someone's
diversity coach.

51:20.344 --> 51:22.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:22.179 --> 51:23.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEBEN NIGATU: Or just even like
filter all
your thoughts about culture
through the prism

51:23.948 --> 51:25.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of, like, one very specific
outlook.

51:25.783 --> 51:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: Yes, and just,
like, not having
to worry, like, what are white
people going

51:28.819 --> 51:30.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to think? Who cares?

51:30.120 --> 51:31.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HEBEN NIGATU: Who cares?

51:31.922 --> 51:38.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY CLAYTON: If this show
doesn't make the
right sort of space for the
general white

51:38.195 --> 51:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person to listen to, they can go
literally
anywhere else and find...

51:41.498 --> 51:42.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:42.967 --> 51:45.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

podcasts.
