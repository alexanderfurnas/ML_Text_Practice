THE REVISION THAT WE SAW TODAY  

07:29.594 --> 07:33.913
FAIRLY BROAD-BASED.             
THE REVISION THAT WE SAW TODAY  
WAS MOSTLY DUE TO TWO FACTORS,  

07:33.914 --> 07:35.740
THE REVISION THAT WE SAW TODAY  
WAS MOSTLY DUE TO TWO FACTORS,  
CONSUMER SPENDING WHICH IS      

07:35.742 --> 07:38.034
WAS MOSTLY DUE TO TWO FACTORS,  
CONSUMER SPENDING WHICH IS      
REVISED UP IN LARGE PART BECAUSE

07:38.036 --> 07:39.529
CONSUMER SPENDING WHICH IS      
REVISED UP IN LARGE PART BECAUSE
OF REESTIMATES OF HIGHER        

07:39.530 --> 07:41.124
REVISED UP IN LARGE PART BECAUSE
OF REESTIMATES OF HIGHER        
SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE.         

07:41.126 --> 07:44.246
OF REESTIMATES OF HIGHER        
SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE.         
BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY THING. 

07:44.249 --> 07:45.476
SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE.         
BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY THING. 
CAPITAL SPENDING WAS ALSO       

07:45.479 --> 07:46.606
BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY THING. 
CAPITAL SPENDING WAS ALSO       
REVISED UP QUITE CONSIDERABLY.  

07:46.609 --> 07:50.229
CAPITAL SPENDING WAS ALSO       
REVISED UP QUITE CONSIDERABLY.  
SO IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD-BASED    

07:50.231 --> 07:52.257
REVISED UP QUITE CONSIDERABLY.  
SO IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD-BASED    
UPWARD REVISION IN GDP.         

07:52.259 --> 07:55.347
SO IT'S A FAIRLY BROAD-BASED    
UPWARD REVISION IN GDP.         
THE GOODS IN, AS YOU SAID AT THE

07:55.349 --> 07:56.975
UPWARD REVISION IN GDP.         
THE GOODS IN, AS YOU SAID AT THE
