JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:07.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.307 --> 00:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Bill
O'Reilly forced
out of FOX News, following a
stream of sexual

00:12.579 --> 00:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harassment complaints and
disclosures of quiet
payoffs.

00:17.450 --> 00:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: close call in
Georgia -- examining
the results from the special
congressional

00:23.223 --> 00:24.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

00:24.257 --> 00:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then: playground fight at the
Supreme Court.

00:27.527 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Should state dollars fund
repairs at a church-owned
day care?

00:32.999 --> 00:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And inside America's militia
movement -- why
armed right-wing groups are
active across

00:38.571 --> 00:39.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nation.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: It could be our own
government overreaching.

00:41.908 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we end up with a tyrant in
office, no one
knows what could happen in 15
years, but at

00:47.647 --> 00:48.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
least we're going to be
prepared.

00:48.915 --> 00:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.523 --> 00:59.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.325 --> 01:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle for a
U.S. House
seat near Atlanta has come down
to a run-off,

01:09.436 --> 01:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a race seen as a referendum
on President
Trump.

01:13.006 --> 01:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Democrat easily led Tuesday's
voting, but
faces a run-off with a
Republican, in a district

01:18.945 --> 01:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has voted Republican for
years.

01:21.047 --> 01:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report later
in the program.

01:24.384 --> 01:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Britain, the House of Commons
overwhelmingly
approved Prime Minister Theresa
May's call

01:28.922 --> 01:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for an early national election.

01:31.324 --> 01:36.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She proposed holding the vote in
June, instead
of waiting until 2020, while
Britain is also

01:36.796 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiating its exit from the
European Union.

01:40.233 --> 01:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before today's vote, may urged
lawmakers to
give the government the
strongest possible

01:46.005 --> 01:47.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hand in the Brexit talks.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: Leaving
the election to 2020 would mean
that we would

01:51.611 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be coming to the most sensitive
and critical
part of the negotiations in the
run-up to

01:56.449 --> 02:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a general election, and that
would be in nobody's
interest.

02:00.320 --> 02:06.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: May ruled out
holding televised
debates during the brief
election campaign.

02:06.893 --> 02:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's national electoral
board today refused
to annul Sunday's referendum
that greatly

02:13.233 --> 02:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expanded the president's powers.

02:15.635 --> 02:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main opposition party
brought the challenge,
and its deputy chairman insisted
the appeals

02:20.840 --> 02:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
process is a long way from over.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BULENT TEZCAN, Turkish
Politician (through
translator): The internal legal
process is

02:27.580 --> 02:32.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now closed with the high
electoral board decision,
but we are determined to employ
all legal

02:32.752 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ways.

02:34.587 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are responsible for both
ourselves and
for the 49 percent of the
Turkish people who

02:37.590 --> 02:38.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voted for no.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will fulfill our
responsibility.

02:40.693 --> 02:44.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The opposition
says it will
go to Turkey's constitutional
court, and,

02:44.931 --> 02:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if need be, to the European
Court of Human
Rights.

02:48.401 --> 02:54.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Syria, evacuations of
thousands of people
resumed today from four besieged
villages.

02:54.641 --> 03:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was part of an exchange deal
involving
two rebel-held towns near
Damascus and two

03:00.180 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pro-government villages in the
north.

03:02.782 --> 03:06.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Civilians and fighters were
transported by
bus.

03:06.052 --> 03:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The exchange was delayed after a
suicide bomber
attacked a convoy on Saturday,
killing more

03:11.858 --> 03:14.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than 120 evacuees.

03:14.194 --> 03:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Pence used an
aircraft carrier
as the backdrop today to warn
North Korea

03:20.867 --> 03:22.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yet again.

03:22.669 --> 03:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He addressed some 2,500 sailors
aboard the
U.S. Ronald Reagan in Tokyo Bay,
and he promised

03:29.309 --> 03:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an overwhelming response if
North Korea tries
something.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
The United States of America
will always seek

03:36.549 --> 03:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peace, but under President
Trump, the shield
stands guard and the sword
stands ready.

03:43.623 --> 03:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
faced questions
today about announcements last
week that another

03:48.895 --> 03:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carrier was sailing for the
Koreas, at a time
when it was still headed the
opposite way.

03:55.301 --> 03:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
defended the president's
statements, and his own.

03:59.372 --> 04:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
What I was asked was, what
signal did it send

04:03.876 --> 04:05.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that it was going there?

04:05.678 --> 04:08.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I answered that question
correctly at
the time, that it signaled
foreign presence,

04:08.815 --> 04:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strength, and a reassurance to
our allies.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a true statement.

04:12.986 --> 04:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As of today, the
USS Carl Vinson
carrier group and its entire
strike group

04:17.824 --> 04:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were still en route to waters
off the Korean
Peninsula.

04:21.861 --> 04:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two more Russian long-range
bombers have been
spotted off Alaska.

04:26.232 --> 04:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was widely reported today
that the aircraft
were detected last night, about
40 miles from

04:31.838 --> 04:32.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Alaskan coast.

04:32.972 --> 04:37.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A similar flyby happened Monday.

04:37.043 --> 04:41.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political discord was in the air
today as
President Trump hosted the Super
Bowl champions

04:41.514 --> 04:43.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
New England Patriots.

04:43.683 --> 04:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several players cited opposition
to him or
his policies as a reason for
staying away.

04:50.056 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Star quarterback Tom Brady said
that he was
dealing with a personal family
matter.

04:54.694 --> 05:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ceremony was overshadowed by
news that
former Patriots star Aaron
Hernandez hanged

05:00.800 --> 05:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself overnight in his prison
cell.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was serving a life sentence
without parole
for murder.

05:07.840 --> 05:14.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newly filed reports show that
the Trump inaugural
committee raised a
record-shattering $107

05:14.514 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

05:16.182 --> 05:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That nearly doubles the record
that was set
by President Obama, eight years
ago.

05:20.453 --> 05:27.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The biggest contributors
included casino mogul
Sheldon Adelson, plus Bank of
America, Boeing

05:27.260 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and others.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's nominee to be deputy
secretary
of commerce has withdrawn.

05:32.865 --> 05:39.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Todd Ricketts, the co-owner of
the Chicago
Cubs, said that he is not able
to resolve

05:39.105 --> 05:40.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conflicts of interest.

05:40.873 --> 05:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 118 points, thanks
partly to

05:46.546 --> 05:48.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a drop in oil prices.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It closed at 20404.

05:50.950 --> 05:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 13, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
four.

05:55.221 --> 06:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the O'Reilly
factor, Bill O'Reilly out at FOX
News; close

06:01.994 --> 06:08.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call in Georgia, what does it
mean?; playground
fight -- should state
governments fund repairs

06:08.501 --> 06:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at church schools?; and much
more.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bill O'Reilly is out at FOX
News.

06:25.518 --> 06:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement today, the
company said: "After
a thorough and careful review of
allegations

06:30.423 --> 06:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against him, the company and
Bill O'Reilly
have agreed that Mr. O'Reilly
will not return

06:35.795 --> 06:37.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to FOX News Channel."

06:37.697 --> 06:42.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The popular TV host and
commentator has been
the face of the network for
nearly two decades.

06:43.002 --> 06:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That all began to unravel after
a New York
Times revealed that FOX paid
some $13 million

06:50.676 --> 06:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to settle allegations of sexual
harassment
filed by women O'Reilly worked
with.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. O'Reilly has long denied
those allegations.

06:59.819 --> 07:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a statement late today,
he said: "It
is tremendously disheartening
that we part

07:04.690 --> 07:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways due to completely unfounded
claims.

07:08.761 --> 07:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that is the unfortunate
reality many of
us in the public eye must live
with today."

07:14.233 --> 07:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With these latest developments,
and what this
ouster may mean for a safer
workplace, I spoke

07:19.439 --> 07:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few moments ago to Michael
Schmidt, a reporter
with The New York Times team who
help break

07:23.576 --> 07:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the most recent story, and
Noreen Farrell.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's executive director of the
civil rights
organization Equal Rights
Advocates.

07:30.683 --> 07:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started by asking Schmidt what
changed the
minds of the Murdoch family.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're the owners of FOX News.

07:37.223 --> 07:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT, The New York
Times: Well,
we wrote our story
two-and-a-half weeks ago,

07:41.194 --> 07:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we said that Mr. O'Reilly
had settled
harassment cases with five
women, including

07:46.499 --> 07:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two in the past year, since
Roger Ailes had
left the network.

07:49.402 --> 07:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the time of our story,
the Murdoch
family was really standing by
Mr. O'Reilly.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They looked like they wanted to
keep him on.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what happened was that he
began to lose
advertisers.

08:00.847 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, he lost Mercedes-Benz,
the first one
to go, and then dozens and
dozens of companies,

08:05.918 --> 08:07.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
went up to about 50.

08:07.787 --> 08:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you had was an 8:00
hour, the prime
time on the network, that had
just a few ads

08:13.359 --> 08:15.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
running on it.

08:15.228 --> 08:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the same time, FOX had
brought in an
outside law firm to do an
investigation into

08:18.764 --> 08:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. O'Reilly, and there was a
real trickle
of women that came in that were
saying different

08:24.537 --> 08:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things about Mr. O'Reilly that
the network
didn't know about.

08:27.807 --> 08:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they sort of saw these two
things emerging,
and the dynamics in the Murdoch
family changed,

08:32.645 --> 08:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's where we got to
today, where they
basically dismissed him.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it wasn't
just about money,
or was it?

08:39.151 --> 08:42.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, the
Murdoch family
hasn't really spoken about this.

08:42.855 --> 08:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we do know is that the
younger -- Rupert's
younger sons, youngest son,
really care about

08:49.328 --> 08:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the culture of the network and
sort of modernizing
it.

08:51.731 --> 08:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened was is that
after Roger
Ailes left last summer, they
that said they

08:55.935 --> 09:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going to change the culture
and that
it was going to be different at
FOX and that

09:00.039 --> 09:03.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
women were going to feel
comfortable there
and there weren't going to be
issues.

09:03.309 --> 09:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what happened was is that,
over that period
of time, they learned about a
deal Mr. O'Reilly

09:07.813 --> 09:09.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had cut with a woman in 2011.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They allowed Mr. O'Reilly to cut
two more
deals.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then this was exposed, and it
put pressure
on them.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were protests outside of
the network.

09:17.290 --> 09:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a plane that flew a
banner around
New York City calling for Mr.
O'Reilly's ouster,

09:22.528 --> 09:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and there was real public
pressure on them.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think the sons really won
out here.

09:26.966 --> 09:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rupert has extreme loyalty to
Mr. O'Reilly,
who was one of the founding
hosts will of

09:31.103 --> 09:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the network when it started 20
years ago.

09:33.105 --> 09:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
as somebody
who has covered network news,
covered related

09:38.010 --> 09:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories, is this an earthquake
in television
news?

09:41.080 --> 09:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, I think
Mr. O'Reilly's
probably the most recognized
host in cable

09:46.152 --> 09:47.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
television.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He certainly had the highest
ratings.

09:48.487 --> 09:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He certainly had, if not the, or
close to
the highest revenues.

09:52.058 --> 09:56.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was a real voice for
conservatives
in this country.

09:56.562 --> 10:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sort of spoke to old-school
American values
and really preached them.

10:02.068 --> 10:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that preachiness and his
tone, you know,
rubbed some people the wrong
way, but it also

10:07.640 --> 10:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brought in some really, really
high ratings.

10:10.209 --> 10:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he really established
himself and had
a real voice, more so than
anything.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And particularly to FOX, he was
seen as very
important because, at the 8:00
hour, he would

10:17.984 --> 10:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring in a lot of ratings, and
then 9:00 and
10:00 would have big ratings as
well.

10:21.787 --> 10:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question FOX, I think,
they were afraid
of is, well, if we take O'Reilly
out of 8:00,

10:26.859 --> 10:30.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the ratings not just going to
go down for
8:00, but 9:00 and 10:00?

10:30.396 --> 10:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what the world that
they're walking
into now.

10:32.331 --> 10:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Noreen Farrell,
we're hearing
Michael described old-fashioned
family values

10:37.703 --> 10:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Bill O'Reilly stood for.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But his leaving is about
something very different,
isn't it?

10:43.843 --> 10:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL, Executive
Director, Equal
Rights Advocates: Yes, and I
think this is

10:45.778 --> 10:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually a pretty remarkable
moment in the
cultural Zeitgeist of sexual
harassment, because

10:50.349 --> 10:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're seeing the power of men
and women as
consumers to influence
workplaces that are

10:57.089 --> 10:58.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not their own.

10:58.891 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, you know, to all
the companies
that pulled out of Bill
O'Reilly's show, I

11:02.995 --> 11:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think many women in America
thank them.

11:05.064 --> 11:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think,
Noreen Farrell,
this is going to have an effect
on the workplace

11:09.435 --> 11:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broadly, or are we -- I mean,
there were those
who predicted that back when
Roger Ailes left

11:15.107 --> 11:17.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
FOX.

11:17.043 --> 11:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: Well, I think,
more and more,
we're seeing that there are
different strategies

11:21.480 --> 11:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that influence workplaces that
create incentives
that clearly 50 years of federal
and state

11:26.185 --> 11:28.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
laws prohibiting sexual
harassment have not.

11:29.021 --> 11:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that includes people who
organize online,
who are really public about
protests, who

11:33.259 --> 11:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
influence companies that are
affiliated with
companies where there are bad
practices, because,

11:38.764 --> 11:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look, this happened in two
weeks.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This probably would take a
lawsuit 10 years.

11:43.269 --> 11:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
is there a
sense -- I know you have been
talking to a

11:47.206 --> 11:54.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of employees at FOX -- that
there is no
more tolerance for sexual
harassment at FOX

11:54.380 --> 11:56.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anymore?

11:56.215 --> 11:59.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, I'm not
sure that the
employees are convinced of that,
because the

11:59.051 --> 12:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Murdochs said last summer that
there wouldn't
be any more tolerance for this,
and that they

12:03.522 --> 12:05.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had done away with this.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had brought in a firm to
investigate
Mr. Ailes, and they said they
had turned the

12:08.761 --> 12:10.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
page and that things were going
to change.

12:10.596 --> 12:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then the employees look, and
they look
the how the network stood by Mr.
O'Reilly,

12:16.035 --> 12:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowing all the things they that
did when
our story ran and continued to
support him

12:19.805 --> 12:21.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the days after that.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're two, two-and-a-half
weeks out from
the story now.

12:24.343 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question for employees
is, how is
FOX going to prove itself to
them that they

12:29.715 --> 12:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are, indeed, serious about this
issue?

12:32.318 --> 12:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess getting rid of Mr.
O'Reilly sends
a certain message, but going
forward, what

12:36.455 --> 12:37.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will be different?

12:37.456 --> 12:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's what they
really wonder.

12:39.291 --> 12:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Noreen Farrell,
when you and
Michael were on the program a
couple of weeks

12:42.394 --> 12:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, when this story first
broke, I think
I asked you a version of this
same question,

12:46.232 --> 12:52.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that is, are women in other
workplaces
who have reason to feel
threatened, who are

12:52.204 --> 12:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiencing sexual harassment,
do they take
away -- are they empowered as a
result of

12:57.743 --> 12:59.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

12:59.245 --> 13:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can they take away any advice
for how to handle
their own situations?

13:02.047 --> 13:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: I certainly
think this is
a good day for women who want to
stand up

13:06.118 --> 13:07.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for their rights in the
workplace.

13:07.953 --> 13:12.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think it remains to be
seen, whether
or not Mr. O'Reilly is given a
golden parachute

13:12.458 --> 13:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or just his walking papers,
about how committed
this company is to really
eradicating sexual

13:17.062 --> 13:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
harassment in its workplaces.

13:19.031 --> 13:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, I think that
this is a day
that women who -- and men who
believe sexual

13:23.969 --> 13:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harassment has no place in the
workplace can
feel good.

13:26.806 --> 13:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Michael
Schmidt, do you
expect -- I mean, is your
reporting telling

13:31.911 --> 13:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you that there will be a large
severance for
Bill O'Reilly, as there was for
Roger Ailes?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess he got, what, $20
million?

13:39.518 --> 13:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, what's
interesting
here is that FOX renegotiated
Mr. O'Reilly's

13:44.323 --> 13:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contract while they knew our
investigation
was going on, and while they
knew that these

13:49.094 --> 13:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
settlements had occurred.

13:50.930 --> 13:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's believed that, in that
contract, FOX
was able to get some sort of
leverage over

13:55.134 --> 13:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. O'Reilly that, if something
went wrong,
they had a better way of getting
out of it.

13:59.972 --> 14:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So ,does that mean that FOX can
get out of
the contract without having to
give him a

14:04.410 --> 14:05.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lot of money?

14:05.411 --> 14:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know those details yet.

14:07.179 --> 14:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do know that Mr. O'Reilly
was making
at least $20 million a year, and
has brought

14:11.951 --> 14:16.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in millions of dollars in books
for himself
and in different paraphernalia
that he sells

14:16.789 --> 14:18.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his show.

14:18.657 --> 14:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, so the question
is, what kind
of hit is Mr. O'Reilly taking
and what will

14:22.595 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he be doing going forward?

14:23.996 --> 14:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you,
Michael Schmidt
and Noreen Farrell.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

14:29.702 --> 14:36.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOREEN FARRELL: Thank you.

14:36.876 --> 14:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats came
close, but Republicans
managed to avoid a potentially
brutal loss

14:45.251 --> 14:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Georgia, for now, forcing a
run-off in
a closely watched special
congressional election.

14:50.823 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JON OSSOFF (D), Georgia
Congressional Candidate:
This is already a victory for
the ages.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:57.162 --> 15:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty-year-old
Democrat Jon
Ossoff fell just short of an
outright win

15:02.067 --> 15:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Tuesday's crowded special
election.

15:05.104 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But by capturing 48 percent of
the vote, the
filmmaker and former
congressional aide easily

15:11.343 --> 15:13.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
outpaced the other 17
candidates.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON OSSOFF: We have shattered
expectations.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:17.116 --> 15:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON OSSOFF: We will be ready to
fight on and
win in June.

15:21.387 --> 15:27.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The seat in
Atlanta's suburbs
came open when Tom Price was
tapped by President

15:27.293 --> 15:29.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump to his Cabinet.

15:29.228 --> 15:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No Democrat has won here since
1979.

15:32.197 --> 15:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now Ossoff faces a run-off
against Karen
Handel, a former Georgia
secretary of state,

15:40.005 --> 15:42.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the top Republican, with 20
percent of
the vote.

15:42.942 --> 15:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN HANDEL (R), Georgia
Congressional Candidate:
On June 20, we keep the Sixth
District red

15:47.079 --> 15:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and kick a little Ossoff.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:50.582 --> 15:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Handel never
mentioned President
Trump last night, but today said
she wants

15:54.987 --> 15:56.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his help.

15:56.755 --> 15:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you think that
President Trump
will come to Georgia and
campaign with you?

15:59.892 --> 16:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN HANDEL: I would hope so.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is all hands on deck for us.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For his part, the
president
compared the result with last
week's close

16:08.567 --> 16:10.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican win in Kansas.

16:10.936 --> 16:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tweeted: "Dems failed in
Kansas and are
now failing in Georgia.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Great job, Karen Handel."

16:18.310 --> 16:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democratic Party's national
chair, Tom
Perez, praised the Ossoff
showing.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PEREZ, Democratic National
Committee Chairman:
Just a few weeks ago, they were
saying a Democrat

16:27.319 --> 16:30.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't get over 42 percent, 43
percent of the
vote.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He got 48.

16:32.124 --> 16:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Georgia race
generated
national interest and a flood of
money.

16:36.328 --> 16:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ossoff raised $8.2 million, 18
times more
than Handel.

16:41.567 --> 16:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In total, Republicans and
Democrats spent
more than $13 million.

16:45.838 --> 16:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And outside groups funneled in
nearly $8 million,
with more than half of that on
ads attacking

16:51.677 --> 16:53.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ossoff.

16:53.479 --> 17:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans face at least
two more special
elections in the months ahead,
in Montana

17:00.452 --> 17:02.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and South Carolina.

17:02.354 --> 17:08.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, can Democrats turn
anti-Trump sentiment
into actual wins in upcoming
races?

17:08.727 --> 17:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we are joined by Stu
Rothenberg,
senior editor of Inside
Elections.

17:13.432 --> 17:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Dante Chinni, he's director
of the American
Communities Project.

17:17.736 --> 17:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a county-by-county look at
the U.S. electorate.

17:20.639 --> 17:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is also a columnist for The
Wall Street
Journal.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

17:25.811 --> 17:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stu, more than $8 million,
unheard of amount
of money in this district.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why couldn't the Democrat, Jon
Ossoff, pull
this off, get over 50 percent?

17:33.819 --> 17:37.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside
Elections: Well,
Judy, this is a very Republican
district.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to understand that --
by more than
a dozen points.

17:39.825 --> 17:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans, when you look at
past Republican
performance, Mitt Romney winning
it overwhelmingly.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tom Price won it very
comfortably, over 60
percent of the vote.

17:47.666 --> 17:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's a tough lift for any
Democrat.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think Ossoff did exceed
expectations.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we will see what happens
with the
run-off.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Again, it's always about
turnout, isn't it?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure.

18:00.712 --> 18:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dante, what did Democrats do
right?

18:03.482 --> 18:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did Ossoff do right, and
where could
he, should he have done better?

18:06.518 --> 18:09.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI, American
Communities Project:
I think what they did right is,
they found

18:09.388 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good district to run in,
frankly.

18:11.590 --> 18:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a district that --
Donald Trump only
won this district by 1.5 points,
even though

18:16.128 --> 18:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Price won it by quite a bit.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's the kind of district
that is really
made for what the Democrats are
now.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's extremely well-educated.

18:23.802 --> 18:24.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is diverse.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not super diverse.

18:26.705 --> 18:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looks a little bit like the
country at
large in terms of the white
non-Hispanic population.

18:30.509 --> 18:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a district that is made
for where
the party is right now.

18:34.046 --> 18:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the -- these are the
kind of people,
the kinds of voters that the
party is resonating

18:38.217 --> 18:39.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

18:40.018 --> 18:43.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, that doesn't
sound like
every single district out there
that Democrats

18:43.755 --> 18:44.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
need to win.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, look, Judy, this is a
Republican district,
but not a Trump district, and
there are other

18:49.094 --> 18:50.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
districts out there.

18:50.863 --> 18:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 20 -- I think it's 23
Republicans
sitting in the House -- in House
districts

18:56.335 --> 18:58.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that were won by Hillary
Clinton.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Democrats need 24 seats.

19:00.506 --> 19:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is the kind of district
that's part
of the mix, highly educated,
high-income district

19:06.712 --> 19:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that doesn't take to Donald
Trump's style,
his personality, and some of his
issue agenda.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are other issues,
other districts
out there that Democrats are
going to have

19:15.787 --> 19:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win, and win first, frankly,
before a district
like this.

19:18.223 --> 19:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
for a moment
about Donald Trump, Dante
Chinni.

19:22.327 --> 19:27.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a clear sense at this
point how much
difference he made or didn't
make in the outcome

19:27.533 --> 19:29.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

19:29.368 --> 19:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: I think it's way
too early to
know what kind of difference he
made in terms

19:32.971 --> 19:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of helping keep Ossoff under 50
percent.

19:35.941 --> 19:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, though, that if you
look at what
happened in this district, look,
as Stu was

19:40.445 --> 19:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, this is a district where
Romney ran
up -- I think he won by 23
points.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2008, John McCain won this by
close to
20 points, I think 18 or 19
points.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are
mainstream Republicans.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes.

19:52.391 --> 19:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a district where I
think, if you
were just looking at the
numbers, you would

19:55.093 --> 20:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say Donald Trump probably didn't
help -- helped
the Democrat much more than he
helped Karen

20:00.999 --> 20:02.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Handel.

20:02.734 --> 20:06.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question -- when I
saw the question
asked of her, do you want Donald
Trump to

20:06.505 --> 20:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come down here, look, you're
going to say
what you're going to say.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's president of the United
States.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're a Republican seeking a
seat in Congress.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're never going to say, don't
come down
here.

20:15.747 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But when I look at that, just...

20:16.748 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She said, I hope
so.

20:17.749 --> 20:18.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I look at that district, I
don't -- who
knows?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who knows?

20:23.188 --> 20:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see the benefit in
Donald Trump going
down there for the Republican.

20:25.424 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I see -- that's the kind of
thing, actually,
that could help Jon Ossoff.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, there are splits in the
Republican Party,
as Stu was saying.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are different kinds of
districts.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This kind of district is not a
good district
for Trump.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

20:38.070 --> 20:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the kind of district
where too much
Trump is going to maybe turn off
a lot of

20:41.340 --> 20:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the voters in this place.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Remember, we're not just talking
about Republicans.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are moderates.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And moderates, this is not...

20:46.078 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: In fact, the
Democratic
strategy is to make the race a
referendum

20:48.313 --> 20:52.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Donald Trump, because,
otherwise, it becomes
about party, partisanship, which
is bad for

20:53.018 --> 20:53.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ossoff.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: So he needs
to make this
-- look, he's a young kid with
not a lot of

20:57.623 --> 20:59.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience, not a lot of
credentials.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't even want the race to
be about
himself.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants it to be about the
president.

21:02.894 --> 21:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I think both
of you were
saying this is going to be tough
for Ossoff

21:07.132 --> 21:08.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to win the run-off.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, because
it's such
a Republican district.

21:11.937 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you add up the Republican
votes and
Democratic votes, it's likely to
be close.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I regard the district, the race
as a tossup.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes, I think Stu
is probably
right.

21:21.813 --> 21:25.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the political
environment is so unsettled
right now.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And normally, you would say,
June, that's
not that far away.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
June in this 2017 feels about a
million years
from right now.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who knows what Donald Trump is
going to tweet.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ossoff is not -- he's a young
candidate, inexperienced
candidate.

21:36.695 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of things could happen.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, yes, I agree.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Looking at it right now, it
looks like as
tossup.

21:40.732 --> 21:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, having said
all this, Stu,
what lessons can Democrats take
away from

21:44.236 --> 21:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this for these other places, not
just the
special elections this year, but
for next

21:49.007 --> 21:50.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year?

21:50.942 --> 21:52.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, I think
they're going
to have to nationalize and any
and all elections

21:52.611 --> 21:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and make it about a midterm
president who
is not particularly popular.

21:58.050 --> 22:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's job approval, it depends
on what poll
you look, 39 percent, 40,
percent, 42 percent,

22:02.354 --> 22:04.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whatever it is.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they want these elections to
be about
Donald Trump and the more
controversial elements.

22:07.859 --> 22:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are going to need to
recruit good candidates
in a large number of
congressional districts

22:12.364 --> 22:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to put those districts in play.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they can do that, then it
depends.

22:16.702 --> 22:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know what Trump's job
approval is
going to be like a
year-and-a-half from now.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know what issues we're
going to be
talking about.

22:22.341 --> 22:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the dynamic needs to kind of
feed a sense
of change and a referendum on
trust for the

22:27.679 --> 22:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democrats to win back the House.

22:29.681 --> 22:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And redistricting
in the geography,
the demography of these
districts isn't favorable

22:33.952 --> 22:35.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Democrats, right?

22:35.287 --> 22:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: No, but it's
changing.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

22:39.224 --> 22:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is because there are the
demographics
of the two parties as we
understand them now,

22:41.693 --> 22:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the demographics of the two
parties as
they existed back in 2012.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think that Donald Trump
is taking
-- and I think a lot of people
is think this

22:48.934 --> 22:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- is trying to take the party
in a different
direction, the GOP in a
different direction.

22:50.435 --> 22:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wants to talk about populism.

22:51.770 --> 22:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to talk to the people
that are left
behind.

22:55.407 --> 22:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Georgia 6 is not full of people
who are left
behind.

22:58.043 --> 23:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's 58 percent of the
population here
who has a bachelor's degree.

23:02.214 --> 23:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 10 best-educated districts
in the country,
nine of them are Democratic with
Democratic

23:07.719 --> 23:09.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
members in Congress.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The 10th is Georgia 6.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is an outlier in some ways.

23:12.791 --> 23:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Stu, for
those districts
where Democrats believe they
have some kind

23:17.396 --> 23:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of decent shot next year...

23:19.564 --> 23:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think there
will be enough
districts in play so that the
House is in

23:26.772 --> 23:27.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
play.

23:27.773 --> 23:28.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not there now.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats are just starting
recruiting.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to have to have a
good fund-raising
cycle.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to need a good
environment.

23:34.112 --> 23:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to need the
president's job
approval to be down around 40
percent.

23:37.449 --> 23:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that happens, then they
will be able
to run -- make the midterm a
referendum on

23:41.653 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Republicans will try to
run a different
race.

23:44.823 --> 23:45.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will try to localize it.

23:46.024 --> 23:47.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will try to discredit the
Democratic
candidates.

23:47.859 --> 23:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of ifs.

23:49.027 --> 23:50.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are a lot of these
inherent splits
in the party.

23:52.364 --> 23:57.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, is Donald Trump the guy
who is going
to take the party and say, I'm
anti-trade,

23:57.035 --> 23:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not pro-trade, I don't like
the global
economy?

23:59.538 --> 24:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of Republicans
who do quite
well in the global economy,
thank you very

24:02.574 --> 24:04.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

24:04.242 --> 24:07.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a very complicated
kind of issue
environment that has to play
out.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does he take the party?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he takes the party in
that direction,
what happens to these different
sides of the

24:11.516 --> 24:12.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
party?

24:12.484 --> 24:13.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know that.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will find out a lot more six
months, 10
months from now.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: April 19, we
don't expect perfect
future prediction from both of
you, but you

24:19.724 --> 24:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generally get it very right,
very close to
right.

24:21.993 --> 24:30.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dante Chinni, Stu Rothenberg,
thanks very
much.

24:30.902 --> 24:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, Judy.

24:36.541 --> 24:41.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Thanks a lot.

24:41.179 --> 24:43.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:43.114 --> 24:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
failing state,
Venezuelans' protests spill out
onto the streets;

24:48.620 --> 24:54.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in the U.S., scientists take
to the streets
protesting cuts in federal
science funding;

24:54.759 --> 24:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and inside America's militias.

24:58.697 --> 25:03.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: Back here in
Washington, the U.S.
Supreme Court grappled once
again with the

25:03.101 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship between church and
state.

25:05.637 --> 25:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the center of today's legal
fight, a school
playground.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has more.

25:11.276 --> 25:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Can the state of
Missouri give
money to repair the playground
of a church-run

25:15.180 --> 25:16.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
day care?

25:16.848 --> 25:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what have we learned in the
first days
of Justice Neil Gorsuch on the
bench?

25:20.285 --> 25:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, chief Washington
correspondent
for "The National Law Journal,"
was in the

25:23.922 --> 25:25.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
courtroom today.

25:25.390 --> 25:26.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hello again, Marcia.

25:26.558 --> 25:27.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Hi, Jeff.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's get right
to it.

25:28.393 --> 25:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The case is Trinity Lutheran vs.
Comer.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it starts with a fairly
ordinary setting,
a playground.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: A playground.

25:35.734 --> 25:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trinity Lutheran Church in
Missouri operates
a day care center, and that day
care center

25:40.539 --> 25:42.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has a playground.

25:42.307 --> 25:49.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It applied for a state grant in
a program
that funds the refurbishing of
playgrounds

25:49.981 --> 25:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the use of recycled tires.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, it complied with all...

25:54.419 --> 25:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A good project,
right, to help
all kinds of...

25:57.789 --> 25:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: It would seem so.

25:59.391 --> 26:03.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It fulfilled all the
requirements for the
grant, but it was denied a
grant.

26:03.228 --> 26:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the explanation was that the
state constitution
prohibits the use of public
funds to either

26:09.534 --> 26:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directly or indirectly support
religious institutions.

26:12.470 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I'm going to read
the exact
language from the Missouri state
Constitution.

26:15.540 --> 26:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"No money shall ever be taken
from the public
treasury, directly or
indirectly, in aid of

26:20.946 --> 26:24.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any church, sect, or
denomination of religion."

26:24.115 --> 26:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Now, the church
decided to challenge
this denial, and it went to
court claiming

26:29.721 --> 26:36.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that the denial of its
application was a violation
of the First Amendment's Free
Exercise Clause,

26:36.494 --> 26:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and also the Equal Protection
Clause.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, so we heard
the arguments
today.

26:40.732 --> 26:42.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: We did.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just -- the church did lose
in the lower
courts, which is why the church
brought it

26:45.971 --> 26:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

26:47.772 --> 26:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, remember, the Free Exercise
Clause doesn't
require government to subsidize
religion.

26:53.078 --> 26:57.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it requires government
not to interfere
with religion.

26:57.315 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And during the arguments today,
my general
sense was that there was more
sympathy than

27:02.854 --> 27:04.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not for the church.

27:04.756 --> 27:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think probably the most
skeptical justice
of the church's position was
Justice Sotomayor.

27:11.896 --> 27:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said there's a lot history
in the states,
of state laws not providing
direct support

27:17.202 --> 27:18.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to churches.

27:18.837 --> 27:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The church won't close its doors
here if it
doesn't refurbish its
playground.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no effect on religious
beliefs.

27:25.276 --> 27:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even if it's a
secular purpose
in this case, she still thinks
there's a case

27:30.582 --> 27:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be made for not giving it to
the church.

27:32.884 --> 27:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

27:34.886 --> 27:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The church's lawyer said that
there is actually
coercion here, that the church
is being penalized

27:40.125 --> 27:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because of its status as a
religious organization.

27:44.162 --> 27:50.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also heard on the other side
Justices Alito
and Breyer, for example, gave a
whole series

27:51.002 --> 27:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hypotheticals to the state's
attorney,
saying, can the constitution
require a state

27:59.010 --> 28:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deny police services or fire
services to
religious institutions?

28:04.983 --> 28:06.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the state's lawyer said,
well, no.

28:06.951 --> 28:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Justice Breyer said, well,
what's the
difference here with the
playground where

28:11.523 --> 28:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're trying to keep little
children from
falling and breaking their
ankles?

28:14.959 --> 28:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even some of the
more liberal
justices were arguing -- or
seemed to be argue

28:20.665 --> 28:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in favor of the church.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: In favor, yes,
exactly.

28:24.035 --> 28:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the state's argument comes
back to this:
Look, we don't want to get
entangled with

28:29.674 --> 28:30.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
churches.

28:30.675 --> 28:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a neutral program.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want to be selecting
among churches.

28:34.879 --> 28:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't want to be sending
a check directly
to a church for a physical
improvement.

28:41.119 --> 28:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, the reason
people watch
these things is not only because
of a playground,

28:45.023 --> 28:45.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but larger implications.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely.

28:47.992 --> 28:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this case
particularly because
there are bigger societal
questions for about,

28:51.429 --> 28:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for example, school voucher
programs.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

28:54.899 --> 28:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, a lot of the religious
organizations
that are supporting the church
in this case

28:58.303 --> 29:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really believe that this could
say a lot about
states that do now have
obstacles to school

29:05.443 --> 29:07.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vouchers.

29:07.212 --> 29:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also may have an impact
on a whole
range of state-funded programs
that do not

29:12.450 --> 29:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accept applications or support
religious organizations.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our last minute, the first
week of Justice
Neil Gorsuch, you got to watch
him.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I happened to be there myself on
Monday.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I know you were.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What did you see?

29:23.495 --> 29:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, he's very
well-prepared.

29:25.296 --> 29:31.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was very active on a hot
bench, although
I think by late today he was
getting a little

29:31.903 --> 29:33.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tired.

29:33.171 --> 29:36.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He wasn't asking as many
questions as he did
that first day.

29:36.441 --> 29:40.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He injects a certain amount of
humor, and
he seems to have a testy side to
him.

29:40.712 --> 29:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A little bite.

29:41.713 --> 29:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Every now and
then, yes.

29:42.881 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he wants to, he can go back
and forth
quite sharply.

29:46.017 --> 29:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes, he can.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

29:48.787 --> 29:52.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, we will be watching
the future
of Justice Neil Gorsuch and all
things with

29:52.157 --> 29:53.124 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, thanks as always.

29:55.894 --> 30:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Thank you, Jeff.

30:01.699 --> 30:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thousands of
Venezuelans took
to the streets in protest again
today.

30:09.340 --> 30:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two demonstrators were killed,
as a political
crisis in this failing state
deepens.

30:14.979 --> 30:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, reports.

30:18.817 --> 30:22.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Organizers
dubbed it the
Mother of All Marches.

30:22.720 --> 30:28.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hundreds of thousands of
opponents to socialist
President Nicolas Maduro flooded
Caracas.

30:28.059 --> 30:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BLANCO, Venezuela
(through translator):
Today, people are in the street
demonstrating

30:33.031 --> 30:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peacefully, seeking a democratic
exit to a
situation that is already
overflowing.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, the president of the
republic is playing
with fire.

30:40.471 --> 30:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The peace was
broken almost
immediately, as protesters
clashed with police

30:45.410 --> 30:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and government supporters.

30:48.012 --> 30:52.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Guard troops fired tear
gas, and
a teenage boy died after being
shot in the

30:52.917 --> 30:54.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
head.

30:54.686 --> 30:59.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Demonstrators have tried
repeatedly in recent
days to reach the capital city's
downtown.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Each time, they were turned back
by riot police.

31:02.594 --> 31:07.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least five people were
killed, and hundreds
arrested.

31:07.799 --> 31:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brian Ellsworth of Reuters,
speaking to us
by Skype from Caracas, said
tensions have

31:12.937 --> 31:14.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been building.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN ELLSWORTH, Reuters: This
has been sort
of the culmination of that,
about two-and-a-half

31:17.742 --> 31:20.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weeks of all these
demonstrations.

31:20.078 --> 31:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opposition called this big
demonstration
and said, all over the country,
we need to

31:24.249 --> 31:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be protesting against the
government.

31:26.117 --> 31:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: These latest
protests erupted
last month, after the
pro-government Supreme

31:32.090 --> 31:37.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court took over the powers of
the national
legislature controlled by the
opposition.

31:37.528 --> 31:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After an international outcry,
the court reversed
itself.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the criticism continued.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
haven't done
anything.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court has installed
a coup d'etat
it cannot correct.

31:49.107 --> 31:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The oil-rich
nation is also
mired in an economic crisis,
with skyrocketing,

31:55.079 --> 31:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
triple-digit inflation, rampant
crime and
food shortages.

31:59.817 --> 32:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The opposition wants Maduro's
removed, new
elections and the release of
political prisoners,

32:05.957 --> 32:11.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including opposition leader
Leopoldo Lopez,
who was jailed in early 2014.

32:11.529 --> 32:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In February, Lopez's wife went
to the White
House with Florida Senator Marco
Rubio.

32:17.268 --> 32:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump tweeted a photo
with her,
saying: "Venezuela should allow
Leopoldo Lopez,

32:22.473 --> 32:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a political prisoner, out of
prison immediately."

32:26.244 --> 32:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That same month, the U.S.
Treasury Department
designated Venezuelan Vice
President Tareck

32:31.449 --> 32:36.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
El Aissami for sanctions on drug
trafficking
charges.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
today:

32:38.423 --> 32:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: We
are concerned that the
government of Maduro

32:41.626 --> 32:47.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is violating its own
Constitution and is not
allowing the opposition to have
their voices

32:47.098 --> 32:48.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heard.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Maduro has
blamed the U.S.
for trying to foment a coup.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLAS MADURO, Venezuelan
President (through
translator): The time for combat
has arrived,

32:55.139 --> 32:56.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my fellow patriots.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hour has arrived to decide
the future
and the destiny of our country.

32:59.978 --> 33:04.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Maduro came to
power four
years ago, upon the death of his
charismatic

33:04.182 --> 33:06.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
predecessor, Hugo Chavez.

33:06.551 --> 33:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maduro has struggled ever since.

33:09.354 --> 33:15.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chavez himself survived a brief
coup in 2002,
and accused the United States of
trying to

33:15.593 --> 33:17.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
subvert him.

33:17.428 --> 33:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Riding on high world oil prices,
Chavez had
created subsidies and price
controls, raising

33:23.201 --> 33:26.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living standards for the poor,
but no longer.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, Brian Ellsworth:

33:28.706 --> 33:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN ELLSWORTH: Once oil prices
collapsed
in 2014, the country basically
hadn't saved

33:32.744 --> 33:34.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money during the oil boom.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Private enterprise has a really
hard time
producing goods and services,
which means

33:37.415 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we basically don't have them.

33:39.350 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Maduro
regime is also
under pressure from its Latin
American neighbors.

33:43.988 --> 33:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eleven countries called this
week for a time
frame to hold elections.

33:48.126 --> 33:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

33:52.964 --> 34:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: Is the
scientific community
finding its political voice?

34:03.975 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien looks
into what is behind street
protests here staged

34:08.746 --> 34:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by members of a profession not
generally known
for their activism.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly Leading
Edge series.

34:15.753 --> 34:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Who is ready to stand up
for science?

34:20.658 --> 34:22.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:22.393 --> 34:27.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are
scientists, and on
this February Sunday in Boston,
they were

34:27.932 --> 34:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conducting an experiment they'd
just as soon
avoid.

34:31.936 --> 34:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facing a White House that is
pushing across-the-board
steep cuts in federal science
funding, they

34:37.075 --> 34:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are taking to the streets.

34:38.776 --> 34:40.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Their hypothesis?

34:40.478 --> 34:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In order to keep their work
alive, they must
dive into the political fray.

34:44.649 --> 34:48.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY SUPRAN, Massachusetts
Institute of
Technology: Today, science
fights back.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:49.854 --> 34:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY SUPRAN: I think,
scientists, it's
not in our natural nature to
shout, to make

34:54.292 --> 34:57.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a loud noise, but, apparently,
we can do it
when come together.

34:57.728 --> 35:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Geoffrey Supran
is a renewable
energy modeler at MIT.

35:02.600 --> 35:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was there among a few hundred
protesters
in Copley Square, one of several
protests

35:07.472 --> 35:11.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staged by scientists since
Donald Trump became
president.

35:11.509 --> 35:16.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration has proposed
double-digit
cuts for the Environmental
Protection Agency

35:16.214 --> 35:21.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the National Institutes of
Health, and
a 20 percent across-the-board
cut to research

35:21.919 --> 35:23.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on climate change.

35:23.788 --> 35:29.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY SUPRAN: As scientists,
it's actually
our responsibility, and as
citizens, to warn

35:29.427 --> 35:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the public when we see danger.

35:30.761 --> 35:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, if you see something,
say something.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we feel the civic duty.

35:35.199 --> 35:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The protesters
here hope this
rally is merely a prelude to
something much

35:39.604 --> 35:45.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bigger, a march en masse in
Washington and
hundreds of other cities all
over the world

35:45.176 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on April 22.

35:48.179 --> 35:51.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kishore Hari is one of the
organizers of the
Earth Day events.

35:51.616 --> 35:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KISHORE HARI, Protest Organizer:
Science has
been political since the time of
Galileo.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nothing has changed between now
and then.

35:57.388 --> 36:01.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's important that we are
nonpartisan
because this is a march for
science, and that

36:01.626 --> 36:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unifies everyone around the
world.

36:03.561 --> 36:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But the idea has
drawn controversy
from some scientists, who are
concerned march

36:09.000 --> 36:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organizers are also advocating a
host of other
liberal social causes.

36:14.939 --> 36:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rally in Boston happened in
the midst
of the annual meeting of the
largest scientific

36:19.343 --> 36:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
society in the world, the
American Association
for the Advancement of Science.

36:25.183 --> 36:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization is supporting
the political
mobilization of many of its
members.

36:30.688 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Physicist and former Democratic
Congressman
Rush Holt is the CEO.

36:34.358 --> 36:39.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSH HOLT (D), Former U.S.
Congressman: This
would be -- it's purported to be
a demonstration

36:39.864 --> 36:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for science, the very idea of
science, the
essence of science.

36:44.902 --> 36:47.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Isn't that a wonderful idea?

36:47.405 --> 36:50.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NAOMI ORESKES, Harvard
University: This rally
isn't about promoting a
particular policy.

36:50.741 --> 36:56.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about promoting the idea
that the scientific
enterprise as a whole improves
our lives.

36:56.147 --> 37:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Naomi Oreskes is
a scientist
and a professor of the history
of science

37:01.285 --> 37:03.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Harvard University.

37:03.321 --> 37:09.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has written extensively
about the role
of politics, special interests
and science.

37:09.160 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For most of history, she says,
scientists
had to be politically and
publicly engaged

37:14.999 --> 37:17.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in order to fund their research.

37:17.134 --> 37:23.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the U.S., that changed
after World
War II, when federal funding
started flowing

37:23.241 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into laboratories.

37:25.042 --> 37:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAOMI ORESKES: We lost the sense
of a kind
of civic obligation, or
reciprocal obligation,

37:30.314 --> 37:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if we expect the taxpayer
to pay for
what we do, that we also should
-- that they

37:34.885 --> 37:37.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have an expectation that we
should be spending
time explaining it.

37:37.888 --> 37:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that breakdown, that
reciprocal
communication breakdown, has had
real consequences

37:43.527 --> 37:45.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in our lifetimes.

37:45.396 --> 37:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: During that same
time, the
political pushback against
science grew, whether

37:49.333 --> 37:54.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the realm was evolution, acid
rain, the ozone
hole, or climate change.

37:54.639 --> 37:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAOMI ORESKES: The scientific
community made
a mistake in not taking that
more seriously.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now we're in a situation
where it's
become a crisis.

38:02.446 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now the scientific
community, I think,
realizes that we have a very
serious problem

38:06.784 --> 38:08.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on our hands.

38:08.586 --> 38:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSH HOLT: Scientists, as a
rule, are not
comfortable being out there
politically, but

38:12.290 --> 38:14.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we should.

38:14.158 --> 38:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putting science into politics
and into society
is something that they can do
and should do,

38:22.600 --> 38:24.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
probably must do.

38:24.335 --> 38:29.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Naomi Oreskes is
writing a
new book, science fiction that
imagines a

38:29.607 --> 38:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
society that embraces climate
change science
and renewable energy.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Geoffrey Supran is helping her
with this.

38:37.948 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After all, renewable energy is
what his research
is all about.

38:41.452 --> 38:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEOFFREY SUPRAN: This is where
we make next-generation
LEDs and solar cells.

38:45.623 --> 38:48.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's essentially a continuous
vacuum facility.

38:48.993 --> 38:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Supran was here
in his lab
at MIT when President Obama
visited in 2009,

38:56.701 --> 39:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving his autograph on a
vacuum chamber
used to make better solar cells
and brighter

39:01.872 --> 39:03.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LEDs.

39:03.708 --> 39:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was sitting in the same place
when it dawned
on him and his colleagues that
most of the

39:08.379 --> 39:14.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technology to tackle climate
change already
exists, but the political will
to do something

39:14.485 --> 39:15.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doesn't.

39:15.953 --> 39:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, for his generation of
scientists,
that is a call to action.

39:19.990 --> 39:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY SUPRAN: There's a
cultural shift
throughout that young people
are, I'm proud

39:23.494 --> 39:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say, taking the lead, I
think.

39:25.496 --> 39:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're really starting to
see the scientific
community adjusting to the
landscape and preparing

39:29.700 --> 39:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself better to deal with the
political realities
of today.

39:32.370 --> 39:37.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they don't get it, let's
run for office
and vote them out.

39:37.575 --> 39:39.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:39.310 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Some scientists
are hoping
to do just that.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Shaughnessy, tell us a
little bit about
today.

39:45.683 --> 39:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Today, we had our first
candidate training
for scientists who are thinking
about running

39:51.222 --> 39:52.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for office.

39:53.023 --> 39:56.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: A science
advocacy group called
314 Action, which is encouraging
scientists

39:56.794 --> 40:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to run, says 3,000 have signed
up for its
candidate training program.

40:02.867 --> 40:09.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
314 Action has some 101-level
political how-to
videos to help them take the
leap out of the

40:09.974 --> 40:11.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lab.

40:11.308 --> 40:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY VAN HOUTEN, NASA Jet
Propulsion Laboratory:
Hi, Heather.

40:13.778 --> 40:17.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Tracy Van Houten, and
I'm the aerospace
engineer who is running for
Congress here

40:17.715 --> 40:19.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this district.

40:19.183 --> 40:22.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: A handful have
thrown their
slide rules into the ring.

40:22.486 --> 40:27.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tracy Van Houten is an engineer
at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory who
works on Mars

40:27.992 --> 40:29.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rovers.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY VAN HOUTEN: I was in
Washington last
week, and then the president's
budget came

40:32.496 --> 40:35.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, and I was there advocating
on behalf
of STEM education.

40:35.633 --> 40:41.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: She ran for in a
special election
for a vacated congressional seat
in Los Angeles.

40:41.071 --> 40:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY VAN HOUTEN: If we really
care about
doing the big things in the
world, for me

40:45.276 --> 40:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at some point, it just didn't
feel big enough
anymore to focus on answering
mankind's questions

40:50.314 --> 40:52.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the universe.

40:52.049 --> 40:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I needed to kind of return my
focus here on
Earth to help out in the
community here.

40:57.488 --> 41:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Tracy Van Houten
didn't succeed
in her experiment.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She lost in the primary.

41:04.361 --> 41:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite her aspirations, she is
most at home
in a clean room.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The smoke-filled room is a new
frontier.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Science is not what?

41:14.038 --> 41:15.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Silence!

41:15.039 --> 41:16.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Thank you.

41:16.874 --> 41:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists may
find it hard
to make the transition, but many
of them believe

41:20.778 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a phase change they are
compelled
to investigate.

41:25.549 --> 41:35.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Miles O'Brien
in Boston.

41:35.593 --> 41:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Miles O'Brien
in Boston.

41:41.131 --> 41:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today is the 22nd
anniversary
of the Oklahoma City bombing;
168 people died

41:47.738 --> 41:50.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in that attack carried out by
Timothy McVeigh.

41:50.975 --> 41:54.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McVeigh sympathized with armed
right-wing
militia groups.

41:54.979 --> 42:00.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These groups are still active,
gaining members
online, and honing their combat
skills in

42:00.718 --> 42:02.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
training camps.

42:02.386 --> 42:07.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s P.J. Tobia went
inside one
of these camps to produce this
report.

42:07.992 --> 42:15.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: This is the kill
house, part of
a training ground for a
right-wing militia

42:15.466 --> 42:17.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the American South.

42:17.301 --> 42:19.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL,
Georgia Security
Force: It's for conducting
military operations

42:19.603 --> 42:21.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in urban terrain.

42:21.372 --> 42:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to practice and rehearse
moving out
to these structures, covering
each other,

42:25.676 --> 42:28.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking cover and concealment
everywhere we
can find it.

42:28.746 --> 42:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: These men and women
call themselves
the Georgia Security Force.

42:33.951 --> 42:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: Our
common goal
is to provide for security for
ourselves,

42:40.624 --> 42:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our friends and our families,
and the other
people in our states, if and
when the need

42:45.596 --> 42:46.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should arise to do so.

42:46.597 --> 42:48.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Their leader, Chris
Hill, A.K.A.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Blood Agent, says the need could
arise at
any time.

42:51.869 --> 42:54.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: I
think, what the
government gives, the government
can take

42:54.905 --> 42:56.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

42:56.206 --> 43:00.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If they're providing the
security for us,
they can take it away.

43:00.244 --> 43:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: They're part of the
3 Percent
Militia, one of the nation's
largest armed

43:05.649 --> 43:07.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right-wing groups.

43:07.585 --> 43:12.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They believe only 3 percent of
colonial Americans
fought the Revolutionary War,
yet were able

43:12.222 --> 43:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to overthrow British rule.

43:15.125 --> 43:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historians say the number of
male colonists
who fought in the conflict,
closer to 25 percent.

43:20.464 --> 43:25.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the Anti-Defamation
League, more
than 10,000 people identify as 3
Percenters.

43:25.669 --> 43:28.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have a presence in nearly
every state.

43:28.072 --> 43:29.039 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Their ideology?

43:29.073 --> 43:31.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A mix of anti-government
conspiracy theories.

43:31.508 --> 43:34.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: It could be our own
government overreaching.

43:34.812 --> 43:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we end up with a tyrant in
office, no one
knows what could happen in 15
years, but at

43:40.684 --> 43:41.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
least we're going to be
prepared.

43:41.885 --> 43:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: 3 Percenters suspect
Islam and
foreigners.

43:45.222 --> 43:46.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Recent refugees represent both.

43:46.724 --> 43:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: It's
an unarmed
invasion.

43:48.425 --> 43:51.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: And some militia
have answered
with violence.

43:51.996 --> 43:57.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recent, militia members have
allegedly participated
in high-profile felonies, from
plots to bomb

43:57.334 --> 44:00.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal buildings, attacks on
immigrant communities
and murders.

J.J.

44:02.473 --> 44:02.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MACNAB, Author, "The
Seditionists": Yes, they
pose a big threat to public
safety.

44:02.906 --> 44:03.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
P.J. TOBIA: J.J.

44:03.874 --> 44:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MacNab is an expert on these
groups.

44:05.609 --> 44:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She travels the country, leading
training
seminars for law enforcement on
militia and

44:09.513 --> 44:11.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other right-wing extremists.

44:11.615 --> 44:15.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She says the groups have
committed or planned
hundreds of violent attacks.

44:15.052 --> 44:16.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.J.

44:16.854 --> 44:21.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MACNAB: They range from plots to
kill cops,
for example, blow up a police
headquarters.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of resisting
arrest.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't believe that cops
have any authority
over them.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Two at a time, two at a
time.

44:27.398 --> 44:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: There are more than
500 militia
groups in the U.S., more than
double the number

44:31.735 --> 44:34.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2008, according to the
Anti-Defamation
League.

44:35.005 --> 44:38.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of them are right-wing and
anti-government.

44:38.042 --> 44:42.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to the 3 Percent
Militia, there's
the Oath Keepers, formed in
2009.

44:42.146 --> 44:46.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're primarily current and
former law enforcement
and military personnel.

44:46.483 --> 44:50.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oath Keepers showed up in
Ferguson, Missouri,
during the protests in the
summer of 2015.

44:50.988 --> 44:55.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said they were there to
help keep the
peace and protect reporters
working for the

44:55.159 --> 44:57.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conspiracy-fueled Web site
Infowars.

44:57.294 --> 45:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, thousands have
flocked to older
groups like the Sovereign
Citizens Movement,

45:02.966 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax resisters who deny the
legitimacy of the
American government.

J.J.

45:07.438 --> 45:11.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MACNAB: There's a lot of
attempts to bomb,
a lot of attempts to build
bombs.

45:12.009 --> 45:15.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of them have dabbled in
biological weapons,
such as ricin.

45:15.813 --> 45:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The Georgia 3
Percenters say they
are strictly a defensive force.

45:20.684 --> 45:25.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In our time together, they
repeatedly renounced
violence and criminality.

45:25.289 --> 45:28.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris Hill says his group is
careful about
who they accept and train.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: Well,
we go through
a vetting process.

45:30.694 --> 45:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Each member has to be
interviewed by a board
of no less than four to five
ranking members

45:36.100 --> 45:37.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from several different states.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We look for red flags.

45:39.470 --> 45:44.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If an individual seems radical
or they're
missing some screws, then we're
going to keep

45:44.374 --> 45:45.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that person to the side.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to be cleared
hot.

45:47.144 --> 45:50.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: These men claim
their militia
gives them a sense of shared
identity.

45:50.047 --> 45:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN "BOOGEYMAN" BOWEN, Georgia
Security
Force: We have basically built
it as a family.

45:53.150 --> 45:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have a lot of family, so
it's family
that I don't have, a lot of
like-minded people,

45:58.355 --> 46:00.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but yet we also stand for the
same cause.

46:00.324 --> 46:06.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: I'm
seeing a conflict
in morals and values in the
country that make

46:06.764 --> 46:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me question, is this really
happening?

46:08.999 --> 46:12.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crybabies are going to demand
transgender
bathrooms.

46:12.336 --> 46:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, your
rights end where
mine begin.

46:15.272 --> 46:19.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, don't push your belief
on me.

46:19.309 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Especially if those
beliefs are
Islamic.

46:21.378 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHAD "KILL ZONE" LEGERE, Georgia
Security
Force: Any terrorist
organization cannot be

46:24.581 --> 46:26.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trusted.

46:26.350 --> 46:29.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, a lot of
them, you know,
are stemming off from the Muslim
religion,

46:29.953 --> 46:31.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you know, from Islam.

46:31.789 --> 46:35.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: In the last year,
the FBI has
disrupted major planned attacks
against Muslims

46:35.893 --> 46:37.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by men affiliated with militias.

46:37.995 --> 46:42.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI is the lead agency in
these kinds
of investigations.

46:42.099 --> 46:46.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Militias have long been active
in the U.S.,
but they have been recently
energized by two

46:46.103 --> 46:51.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
key events: last year's
occupation of an outside
wildlife refuge in Oregon by
anti-government

46:51.608 --> 46:57.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activist Ammon Bundy, and the
2014 standoff
in Nevada, where Bundy's father,
backed by

46:57.447 --> 47:02.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militiamen, squared off with
federal officials
over grazing rights on public
lands.

47:02.719 --> 47:05.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chris Hill was one of those
militiamen at
Bundy ranch.

47:05.122 --> 47:06.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: I was
pissed off.

47:06.924 --> 47:12.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was angered seeing peaceful
people being
pushed around, and this
bureaucratic agency

47:12.930 --> 47:18.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is training their weapons down
on a family
because maybe they owe taxes
because the cows

47:18.368 --> 47:20.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eat corn.

47:20.070 --> 47:22.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: For the Georgia 3
Percenters,
Donald Trump's election sends a
signal.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS "BLOOD AGENT" HILL: With a
Trump victory,
that gives me a little bit of
hope, where

47:26.009 --> 47:34.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had none, that we can turn the
tide against
these communist, Marxist,
socialist ideas

47:34.218 --> 47:35.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of governing.

47:35.219 --> 47:36.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
P.J. TOBIA: J.J.

47:36.753 --> 47:40.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MacNab says Trump's presidency
also changes
the target of militias' rage.

47:40.657 --> 47:44.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can no longer focus on
President Obama
or candidate Clinton.

47:44.228 --> 47:45.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.J.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MACNAB: I don't have a good
feeling about
where this is going.

47:48.031 --> 47:53.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens right now when
Trump paints targets
on people, when he paints
targets on the press?

47:53.170 --> 47:57.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went off about a state
senator who did
something a sheriff didn't like
in Texas.

47:57.507 --> 47:59.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, let's take him down.

47:59.176 --> 48:02.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he's joking, but this
movement doesn't
have a sense of humor.

48:02.212 --> 48:07.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Despite the FBI's
recent arrests,
MacNab says federal law
enforcement isn't

48:07.384 --> 48:08.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doing enough.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.J.

48:09.953 --> 48:12.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MACNAB: They have done almost
nothing to monitor
and counter this movement.

48:12.322 --> 48:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It started in 2009, right after
Obama took
office.

48:15.759 --> 48:20.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: In that year, DHS
released a memo
to law enforcement, detailing
the threat posed

48:20.597 --> 48:21.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by right-wing extremists.

48:21.632 --> 48:23.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.J.

48:23.433 --> 48:27.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MACNAB: But because it had a
line saying that
veterans returning home from war
were at risk

48:27.170 --> 48:31.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of being approached by this
movement, Homeland
Security disavowed it, and they
terminated

48:32.009 --> 48:34.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the division that tracked this
movement.

48:34.077 --> 48:37.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The man who led that
division
of DHS is Daryl Johnson.

48:37.781 --> 48:39.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARYL JOHNSON, Former Department
of Homeland
Security Official: There was
basically a political

48:39.149 --> 48:40.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
firestorm that erupted.

48:40.150 --> 48:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: And you lost your
job.

48:42.152 --> 48:43.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DARYL JOHNSON: Pretty much.

48:43.820 --> 48:47.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Johnson says he was
forced to
resign and now runs a consulting
business

48:47.357 --> 48:49.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with government contracts.

48:49.226 --> 48:54.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of capabilities for
monitoring these
groups does the DHS Have now?

48:54.097 --> 49:00.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARYL JOHNSON: Yes, so, since I
left in 2010,
Homeland Security had one
analyst that was

49:00.237 --> 49:05.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at these problems, these
domestic
terrorist issues, and,
eventually, that lone,

49:05.409 --> 49:07.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
single analyst left.

49:07.511 --> 49:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so today they have no -- no
one looking
at this threat.

49:11.181 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: In response to
"NewsHour"'s questions
about militia groups, a
Department of Homeland

49:15.352 --> 49:20.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security spokesperson said that,
since 2009,
they have improved their
analysis of domestic

49:20.891 --> 49:25.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism and continue to work
with the FBI
to investigate these groups.

49:25.095 --> 49:31.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The spokesman denied that
Johnson was forced
out of the agency, adding that
Johnson's 2009

49:31.034 --> 49:35.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report was withdrawn because of
incomplete
sourcing and poor analytic
tradecraft.

49:35.238 --> 49:37.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But J.J.

49:37.040 --> 49:40.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MacNab says the lack of federal
law enforcement
attention has had deadly
consequences, like

49:40.944 --> 49:45.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when two Arkansas police
officers were gunned
down by tax-resisting Sovereign
Citizens in

49:45.782 --> 49:46.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2010.

49:46.783 --> 49:48.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.J.

49:48.719 --> 49:52.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MACNAB: A police chief in West
Memphis, Arkansas,
had two of his officers killed
by a Sovereign

49:52.089 --> 49:54.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Citizen and two others shot.

49:54.291 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He reads all the things that he
got from the
FBI, and while they had told him
in incredible

49:59.429 --> 50:04.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
detail what the risks of
al-Qaida were, they
had never mentioned any
homegrown extremism

50:04.468 --> 50:07.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that wasn't Islamic.

50:07.170 --> 50:15.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Both Johnson and
MacNab say that
militia have successfully
recruited police

50:15.212 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and active military personnel.

50:16.980 --> 50:20.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARYL JOHNSON: We have a lot of
returning
veterans, military members who
have fought

50:20.517 --> 50:26.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq, and they
bring that mentality with them,
that training

50:27.024 --> 50:32.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they had in the military,
that kind of
desensitized, dehumanized
Muslims in these

50:32.763 --> 50:34.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
war zones and in these
conflicts.

50:35.032 --> 50:38.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, when they come home, a
lot of them
carry that sentiment with them,
and it reflects

50:38.969 --> 50:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
itself in the modern-day militia
today.

50:40.804 --> 50:42.773 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
J.J.

50:42.806 --> 50:45.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MACNAB: With law enforcement,
that's particularly
problematic, because if, for
example, an agency

50:45.742 --> 50:52.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to investigate someone
they suspect
of building a bomb, will one of
their members,

50:52.149 --> 50:55.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the police officers who
is part of
that group tip off the criminal?

50:55.919 --> 51:01.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a recent leak that came
out of an
FBI manual that talked about how
there were

51:01.058 --> 51:06.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white supremacists, for example,
in certain
police departments, but the FBI
couldn't tell

51:06.997 --> 51:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the police departments that it
was a problem,
because they were worried that
that would

51:10.367 --> 51:12.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tip off the white supremacists
they were investigating.

51:12.869 --> 51:17.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: We asked to speak to
the FBI about
the monitoring of domestic
militias and militias

51:17.674 --> 51:19.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recruiting veterans.

51:19.543 --> 51:24.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bureau declined, but a
spokesperson said,
"Our focus is not on membership
in particular

51:24.347 --> 51:26.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
groups, but on criminal
activity."

51:26.349 --> 51:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI added that they want to
protect the
rights of all Americans.

51:30.854 --> 51:34.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Members of the Georgia Security
Force claim
that they, too, are committed to
protecting

51:34.191 --> 51:37.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those rights by any means
necessary.

51:37.194 --> 51:44.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm P.J.
Tobia in
Monroe County, Georgia.

51:44.167 --> 51:53.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
television
milestone.

51:53.443 --> 51:58.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX Television's animated comedy
series "The
Simpsons" turns 30 today and is
one of the

51:58.915 --> 52:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
longest-running programs on
television history.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham tells that
story.

52:04.654 --> 52:13.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thirty years
ago today,
viewers met what would become an
iconic American

52:13.697 --> 52:17.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
family, the Simpsons.

52:17.234 --> 52:24.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On April 19, 1987, this
strange-talking, yellow-skinned
family of five made their TV
debut, appearing

52:24.374 --> 52:28.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
initially on the sketch comedy
series "The
Tracey Ullman Show."

52:28.311 --> 52:37.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, soon, 20th Century Fox spun
them off
into their own 30-minute
program.

52:37.420 --> 52:43.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 600 episodes, and 32
Emmy Awards
