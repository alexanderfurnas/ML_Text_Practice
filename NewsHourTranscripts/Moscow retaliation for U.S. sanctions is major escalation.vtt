JUDY WOODRUFF: The government of
Russia announced today that the
U.S. would need to drastically

00:05.100 --> 00:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduce the number of
its officials working
in Russia, and could no
longer use two properties

00:10.766 --> 00:12.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan is
in New York with more.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
move follows two American
actions, both related to
the Russian interference

00:19.500 --> 00:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election.

00:21.966 --> 00:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last December, the
Obama administration
seized two Russian-owned
compounds in the U.S., and

00:28.566 --> 00:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expelled 35 Russian diplomats
who the U.S. claimed were
intelligence operatives.

00:34.566 --> 00:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, the U.S.
Senate passed a bill that
included new sanctions on
Russia for its election

00:37.533 --> 00:39.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hacking.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That bill now awaits the
president's signature or veto.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With me now is special
correspondent Nick Schifrin.

00:43.666 --> 00:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nick, in addition to what
Judy just told us, what
are the Russians demanding?

00:46.333 --> 00:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By September the 1st, the
U.S. has to reduce its staff
inside of Russia to 455.

00:54.466 --> 00:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's at the embassy in
Moscow and three consulates
around the country.

00:56.533 --> 01:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by Monday, they will lose
access to a storage facility
inside Moscow, as well as

01:01.033 --> 01:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a country house that
they generally use
right outside of Moscow.

01:04.233 --> 01:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Russia vows to punish them
even more if the U.S. responds.

01:08.866 --> 01:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is the
State Department concerned?

01:10.566 --> 01:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do we have lots
more people there?

01:12.666 --> 01:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, this is a
major escalation because of the
numbers of people who are there.

01:19.333 --> 01:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former U.S. officials tell me
that there are anywhere from
1,100 to 1,500 staff in Russia,

01:24.766 --> 01:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so to bring that down to
455 could mean expelling
hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of U.S.

01:31.733 --> 01:34.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
staff.

01:34.166 --> 01:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is on a magnitude
much higher than the
expelling of 35 Russians
believed to be intelligence

01:38.900 --> 01:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officers by President
Obama last year.

01:41.233 --> 01:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, clearly, today's
announcement is designed
not just to affect
U.S. ability to conduct

01:48.266 --> 01:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence in Russia, but the
U.S. ability entirely, the U.S.
government's entire ability

01:52.633 --> 01:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to conduct its
operations in Russia.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, what
are the Russians that you
spoke to today telling you?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this significant enough?

01:58.033 --> 02:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this a turning point?

02:00.233 --> 02:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It could be a
turning point, because it does
seem to signify that President

02:02.966 --> 02:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin has given
up his hope that the
relationship could get better.

02:09.966 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the U.S. and Russia
have high-level talks going on
right now, and Russia certainly

02:15.166 --> 02:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been expecting some
concessions out of that, but one
Russian official told me today

02:18.333 --> 02:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - quote -- "We came to a point
where there was no that hope
those talks could yield any

02:23.266 --> 02:25.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
results."

02:25.333 --> 02:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that lack of hope really
pervades the entire Russian
point of view right now.

02:28.033 --> 02:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They hoped, perhaps
expected, President Trump
to improve the relationship.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And other than some pro-Russian
rhetoric, not much has changed.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are still country
homes not returned to Russia.

02:38.866 --> 02:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are still sanctions,
and, as you mentioned,
that congressional bill.

02:41.966 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Russians have been delayed
this response for seven
months, hoping the relationship

02:46.233 --> 02:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would get better.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it seems like their
patience has run out.

02:49.700 --> 02:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Hari, the U.S. would
say, look, it was Russia that
brought us to this point, both

02:53.533 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the election hacking and
its actions in Ukraine.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia says, we
didn't hack anything.

02:58.266 --> 03:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the statement today calls
what the U.S. is doing a
witch-hunt -- quote -- "The U.S.

03:02.200 --> 03:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is using Russia's alleged
interference in its
domestic affairs as an
absolutely contrived

03:07.200 --> 03:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excuse for its persevering and
crude campaigns against Russia."

03:11.066 --> 03:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally,
put this in perspective.

03:12.566 --> 03:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You just did a long
series on Russia.

03:14.566 --> 03:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where is the relationship
between the two countries
in the longer arc?

03:17.633 --> 03:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Even during the
Cold War, there was no occasion
when either side kicked out

03:21.700 --> 03:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hundreds of the
other person's staff.

03:24.466 --> 03:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of Russia watchers
told me today that they think
it's about the early '80s.

03:30.866 --> 03:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been that long since this
relationship was that bad.

03:32.733 --> 03:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's, of course, after the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

03:35.533 --> 03:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, what brought the
relationship better in
the '80s was a change
eventually in Soviet

03:40.133 --> 03:41.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leadership.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

03:42.666 --> 03:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And President
Putin is not going anywhere.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question is, how
does the U.S. respond, not
only to today, but also does

03:48.000 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump sign
that congressional bill
increasing sanctions?

03:50.500 --> 03:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Nick Schifrin, many thanks.

03:51.933 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thank you.
