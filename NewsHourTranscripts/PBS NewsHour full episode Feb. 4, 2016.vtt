JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.374 --> 00:11.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
We're on the ground in New
Hampshire, where

00:11.144 --> 00:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidential candidates in both
parties face
a crucial test next week.

00:15.782 --> 00:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Thursday, we sit
down with the president of
Colombia, Juan

00:20.420 --> 00:26.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manuel Santos, to discuss a
possible peace
deal with the FARC rebels, and
the new Zika

00:26.193 --> 00:27.995 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President: I
am very concerned, because this
is, for us,

00:30.964 --> 00:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something new. It is new for the
world.

00:33.166 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And all in, the
real odds of
playing fantasy sports.

00:38.605 --> 00:41.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG, The New York
Times: Some
of them are guys who worked on
Wall Street

00:42.042 --> 00:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and were investment analysts,
and a lot of
them, I think, are just guys who
are of sort

00:48.649 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of good at sports statistics and
that they
found a way to turn this into a
living.

00:52.986 --> 01:00.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.061 --> 01:03.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.864 --> 01:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's been another
day of hard
campaigning, and hard words, in
New Hampshire,

01:13.674 --> 01:19.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where primary day is just five
days off. As
Democrats prepared to debate
tonight, the

01:19.179 --> 01:22.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top Republican contenders took
new shots at
each other.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Cruz fired off
a broadside.

01:26.887 --> 01:31.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump is very rattled
right now. You

01:32.092 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, he said, how stupid could
the people
of Iowa be? I assume the next
question he's

01:37.130 --> 01:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to ask is, how stupid can
the people
of New Hampshire be?

01:39.766 --> 01:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While, in
Exeter, Trump suggested
again that Cruz's win in Iowa
was tainted.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We will find out what happens.
That was a

01:46.740 --> 01:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very strange thing that happened
in Iowa.

01:48.709 --> 01:53.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the
meantime, the candidates
that some call establishment
kept their fire

01:53.180 --> 01:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trained on one another. Marco
Rubio made his
own appearance in Portsmouth.

01:57.150 --> 02:00.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
I am the conservative that can
win. And if

02:00.654 --> 02:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we win, we can turn this country
around.

02:02.622 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Chris
Christie dismissed
that claim, telling ABC News
that, in fact,

02:07.127 --> 02:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Florida senator is the most
coddled candidate
in the race.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
The heat that he will get from
Hillary Clinton,

02:12.966 --> 02:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he's ever the nominee, will
be much greater
than anything any of us could
throw at him.

02:16.703 --> 02:17.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: For
Democrats...

02:17.871 --> 02:19.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Are you
really progressive?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: ... Hillary
Clinton herself
was feeling the heat last night
at CNN's town

02:22.909 --> 02:28.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hall in Derry, New Hampshire. At
issue, still,
who's the true progressive?

02:28.215 --> 02:32.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, ahead in New
Hampshire polls,
appeared separately. He argued
that Clinton's

02:32.886 --> 02:34.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ties to Wall Street are a
disqualifier.

02:34.988 --> 02:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I do not know any progressive
who has a super

02:40.193 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAC and takes $15 million from
Wall Street.
That's just not progressive.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:48.335 --> 02:52.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton was
pressed, in particular,
for speaking fees she'd
previously collected

02:52.139 --> 02:53.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Goldman Sachs.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER: Did you have to
be paid $675,000?

02:55.342 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I don't know. That's what
they offered.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: But she
insisted the money
wouldn't sway her policy about
banks.

03:02.783 --> 03:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Name
anything they
have influenced me on. Just name
one thing.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm out here every day saying
I'm going to
shut them down, I'm going after
them, I'm

03:10.857 --> 03:15.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to jail them if they
should be jailed,
I'm going to break them up. I
mean, they're

03:15.729 --> 03:18.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not giving me very much money
now. I can tell
you that much.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:20.233 --> 03:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In between the
barbs, there
were also glimpses of how the
candidates view

03:22.869 --> 03:24.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world at their core.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And I worry
very much
about a society where some
people spiritually

03:28.108 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, it doesn't matter to me, I
got it, I
don't care about other people.

03:33.346 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So my spirituality is that we
are all in this
together and that when children
go hungry,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when veterans sleep out on the
street, it
impacts me.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Be
grateful for being
a human being, being part of the
universe.

03:47.494 --> 03:51.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Be grateful for your
limitations. Know that
you have to reach out to have
more people

03:51.398 --> 03:57.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be with you, to support you, to
advise you.
Listen to your critics. Answer
the questions.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, at the end, be grateful.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton and
Sanders face
each other directly tonight in a
debate just

04:03.810 --> 04:07.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
added to the calendar hosted by
MSNBC in Manchester.

04:07.514 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we turn to
our political
director, Lisa Desjardins, in
Manchester.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, you have been on the
ground there. You
have been going to events,
talking to voters.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you hearing? What do
they want to
hear?

04:19.326 --> 04:24.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think this is
the moment
where New Hampshire is fully
turning its attention

04:24.698 --> 04:26.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this race.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen, I think that this is not a
time to look
at polls coming out of New
Hampshire, because

04:30.137 --> 04:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from my talks with voters today,
even those
who have told pollsters that
they made up

04:35.408 --> 04:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their mind told me today that
they're still
squishy, that they're still
looking at all

04:40.413 --> 04:42.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the candidates.

04:42.382 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what it feels like today
in New Hampshire,
Gwen, is a moment of great and
kind of profound

04:46.353 --> 04:50.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evaluation. Voters here feel
like it is a
very important contest on both
sides, and

04:50.924 --> 04:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are some voters I talked
to today who
said they're not even sure which
party they're

04:54.394 --> 04:56.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to vote with.

04:56.263 --> 04:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So at these events
that you go
to visit, whether ladies who
lunch, meeting

04:59.266 --> 05:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with surrogates, or whether it's
Donald Trump
at a police station, or
political tourists

05:06.039 --> 05:10.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from all over the country, what
is it that
people are feeling, are looking
for, are actually

05:11.011 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
searching around for?

05:12.946 --> 05:18.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a good
question, because
I'm not sure the campaigns
coming out of Iowa

05:18.285 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have fully embraced what voters
here in New
Hampshire are looking for.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iowa, it seemed clear there
were a lot
of supporters looking for their
candidates.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted exposure, and they
wanted those
big, large speeches. Here in New
Hampshire,

05:30.964 --> 05:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the voters are telling me again
and again
they want that personal contact.
They demand

05:35.835 --> 05:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. It's nothing to them to see
a candidate
four or five times.

05:38.738 --> 05:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know our viewers have heard
that before,
but I think it's especially
worth putting

05:43.176 --> 05:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a spike in right now. When Ted
Cruz, Donald
Trump, and Marco Rubio all seem
to be in a

05:48.815 --> 05:53.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real horse race, they have a
pool of voters
that, just from talking to them
on the ground,

05:53.620 --> 05:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gwen, aren't sure which one to
go with.

05:55.655 --> 06:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those Republican voters, Gwen,
that I talked
to today, they want a strong,
tough leader,

06:00.227 --> 06:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they also want one who they
think will
represent this country with
dignity. They

06:04.464 --> 06:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see three candidates who all
represent very
different combinations of those
things they

06:08.735 --> 06:13.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want. And I have not heard many
voters today
who said they are 100 percent
sure about which

06:14.007 --> 06:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one of those three are on top.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on top of those three, there
are other
Republicans that are very much
in the game

06:19.613 --> 06:21.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to get to
them. I want
to talk about the dignity piece.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have seen a lot
of squabbling
going back at the top of both
sides.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But does that allow
someone like
Marco Rubio, who seems seemed to
have at least

06:30.957 --> 06:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come out of Iowa looking better
than expected,
he said, to walk through the
middle of all

06:35.829 --> 06:37.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that?

06:37.697 --> 06:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That certainly
is the Rubio
campaign's hope, but to be
honest, Gwen, as

06:42.135 --> 06:46.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much as we hear so much about
Marco Rubio,
I'm not sure he's surging quite
yet in New

06:46.439 --> 06:48.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

06:48.308 --> 06:51.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I felt from voters today is
that those
who had not really given him a
hard look before

06:52.078 --> 06:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now are looking at him closely.
So I think
over this weekend, maybe that
surge will start

06:56.683 --> 07:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to happen, the doors open for
him. I think
you're right that there is a
question of dignity.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has used more
colorful language
than before today and in the
past couple of

07:05.759 --> 07:09.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days. And I heard more than one
voter who
said that they liked Trump,
saying that they

07:09.963 --> 07:14.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
don't like the way he's
questioning the results
in Iowa. They say he needs to
move on, and

07:15.035 --> 07:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's making them look at him in
a little bit
of a different way.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, tonight,
another Democratic
debate. Last night, we had a
forum, tonight,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both of them are on stage. What
are we expecting?

07:23.677 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right. This is
a huge moment
for both Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders.

07:28.481 --> 07:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, Bernie Sanders way
out in front
in the polls, but when you talk
to voters

07:32.118 --> 07:37.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here, there are a lot of
question marks about
not just whether his agenda is
feasible, but

07:37.557 --> 07:39.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is it doable?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not just could anyone in some
time in the
future create this political
revolution, but

07:43.530 --> 07:47.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the next eight years, when
voters feel
they need economic help, could
Bernie Sanders

07:47.734 --> 07:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually bring some of that
economic help?
So, that's the question he has
to answer in

07:51.504 --> 07:53.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this debate.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Hillary Clinton, it's almost
the opposite.
Her strength is that voters feel
that she

07:56.242 --> 08:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can get things done. We have
seen her talk
about that, but there is a lot
of mistrust

08:00.947 --> 08:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of her. We have talked about
that before.

08:02.849 --> 08:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's interesting, Gwen, is
it's from
voters who feel they know her
very well. She

08:07.120 --> 08:10.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bill Clinton have campaigned
here for
many cycles. So she has to sort
of present

08:10.824 --> 08:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new side to a face that is
very well known
here. That is not always easy to
do.

08:15.261 --> 08:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From the ground in
Manchester,
New Hampshire, for us tonight,
Lisa Desjardins,

08:19.666 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

08:22.469 --> 08:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, the
former head of a drug company,
Martin Shkreli,

08:27.607 --> 08:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took the Fifth today on why he
raised the
price of a critical drug by 5000
percent.

08:34.114 --> 08:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one-time boss of Turing
Pharmaceuticals
appeared at a congressional
hearing, but he

08:39.285 --> 08:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
repeatedly refused to testify.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SHKRELI, Former CEO,
Turing Pharmaceuticals:
On the advice of counsel, I
invoke my Fifth

08:43.690 --> 08:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amendment, privilege against
self-incrimination,
and respectfully decline to
answer your question.

08:48.361 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lawmakers on both
sides blasted
Turing's decision to raise the
price of medicine

08:54.267 --> 08:56.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a deadly parasitic
infection.

08:56.936 --> 09:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Shkreli appeared to make
light of it all,
and Maryland Democrat Elijah
Cummings took

09:02.175 --> 09:03.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him to task.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D),
Maryland: The way
I see it, you can go down in
history as the

09:07.547 --> 09:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poster boy for greedy drug
company executives,
or you can change the system.
Yes, you. You

09:16.956 --> 09:23.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detailed the knowledge about
drug companies
and the system we have today.
And I truly

09:23.430 --> 09:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe -- are you listening?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SHKRELI: Yes.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Thank you.

09:30.303 --> 09:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I truly believe you could become
a force of
tremendous good.

09:34.774 --> 09:39.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The appeal,
though, may have
fallen on deaf ears. After he
left the hearing,

09:39.746 --> 09:44.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shkreli's official Twitter
account flashed
a message that read: "Hard to
accept that

09:44.984 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these imbeciles represent the
people of our
country."

09:48.321 --> 09:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The latest numbers
are in, and
12.7 million people signed up
for private

09:53.726 --> 09:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health insurance this year under
the Affordable
Care Act. That means enrollment
is in line

09:59.065 --> 10:03.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with the administration's
projections. This
was the third sign-up season
under the president's

10:03.703 --> 10:05.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health care law.

10:05.572 --> 10:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the Zika virus
outbreak,
Brazilian authorities say they
have identified

10:09.609 --> 10:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two cases transmitted through
blood transfusions.
The virus is most commonly
spread through

10:15.315 --> 10:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquito bites, and is being
linked to birth
defects. The outbreak has now
spread across

10:20.353 --> 10:22.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much of Latin America.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Greece, public
transit and
services ground to a halt in
much of the country

10:26.993 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, as thousands of people
walked off the
job in a general strike.
Farmers, doctors

10:32.365 --> 10:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and others joined public workers
to protest
pension reforms tied to Greece's
third international

10:38.738 --> 10:40.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bailout.

10:40.607 --> 10:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This cannot go on. They
must withdraw
this monstrous bill right now.
This reform

10:45.945 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan is against the workers and
the people.
We will continue fighting until
victory.

10:50.049 --> 10:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Demonstrations were
largely peaceful,
but some anarchist protesters
and police exchanged

10:56.589 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
firebombs and tear gas in
clashes outside
the parliament building in
Athens.

11:01.761 --> 11:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, word
today Hillary Clinton wasn't the
only secretary

11:06.666 --> 11:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state to receive classified
information
in personal e-mails. The
department's inspector

11:12.105 --> 11:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general has found sensitive data
in e-mails
sent to former Secretaries Colin
Powell and

11:18.011 --> 11:24.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Condoleezza Rice or their
staffs. Clinton's
campaign says State has gone --
quote -- "overboard"

11:24.417 --> 11:26.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on classification.

11:26.352 --> 11:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's another big
air bag recall.
Continental Automotive Systems
says up to

11:31.124 --> 11:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five million vehicles worldwide
are affected.
Something less than two million
are in the

11:35.895 --> 11:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Moisture can damage the air
bags so they
don't deploy in a crash. And
Honda has recalled

11:42.268 --> 11:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another 2.2 million vehicles in
North America.
They have Takata air bags that
can fire metal

11:49.042 --> 11:50.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shards.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street
managed modest
gains today. The Dow Jones
industrial average

11:53.947 --> 12:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was up nearly 80 points to close
at 16416.
The Nasdaq rose five, and the
S&amp;P 500 added

12:02.188 --> 12:03.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
three.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the founder and
leader of
Earth, Wind and Fire, Maurice
White, has died.

12:07.894 --> 12:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The band formed in the late
1960s, and sold
more than 90 million albums,
with hits that

12:12.465 --> 12:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
included "September," "Shining
Star" and "Boogie
Wonderland." They joined the
Rock and Roll

12:17.604 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hall of Fame in 2000. Maurice
White was 74
years old.

12:22.775 --> 12:27.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Colombia's
president on his country's
prospects for peace

12:27.647 --> 12:33.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after 50 years of conflict;
billions of dollars
pledged to Syria as its peace
talks break

12:33.820 --> 12:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down; the economic booms and
busts of fantasy
sports; and much more.

12:42.395 --> 12:55.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late this
afternoon, the White
House announced a proposed $450
million aid

12:55.541 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
package for the nation of
Colombia. The two
countries also agreed to
cooperate to combat

13:00.780 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Zika virus, now present
throughout most
of South America.

13:05.018 --> 13:10.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bulk of the proposed funding
would go
to reinforce a long-running aid
public called

13:10.223 --> 13:16.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plan Colombia with what
President Obama dubbed
Peace Colombia to cement a peace
deal spearheaded

13:16.963 --> 13:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the Colombian president.

13:21.501 --> 13:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Juan Manuel Santos came to the
White House
this afternoon at a critical
moment in his

13:26.205 --> 13:34.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation's history: the potential
end to Latin
America's longest-running war.
There have

13:34.514 --> 13:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been more than 50 years of
fighting between
the Colombian government and the
revolutionary

13:39.819 --> 13:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
armed forces of Colombia, the
leftist group
known by its Spanish acronym,
FARC.

13:45.858 --> 13:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's led to the deaths of more
than 220,000
people, millions more displaced.
But after

13:52.331 --> 13:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three failed attempts at peace
accords, and
four years of talks, a deal may
be within

13:58.705 --> 14:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sight. So far, negotiations
hosted in Cuba
have yielded agreements on land
reform, illegal

14:06.846 --> 14:12.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drug trafficking, prisoner
releases, and efforts
to find missing persons.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ivan Marquez is lead negotiator
for the FARC.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVAN MARQUEZ, Lead Negotiator,
FARC (through
translator): This peace process
has progressed

14:19.258 --> 14:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like no other in Colombia. It
shouldn't have
the armed confrontation as a
backdrop, nor

14:23.996 --> 14:29.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sad death of young uniformed
soldiers,
policemen and guerrillas. Only
in an atmosphere

14:29.235 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of trust and harmony can we
agree on what
is needed to reach the final
agreement.

14:33.306 --> 14:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If that happens,
the government
will need to expand health and
education services

14:38.444 --> 14:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into rebel-controlled areas.
It's a job made
more challenging by the
emergence of the Zika

14:44.517 --> 14:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
virus and its link to birth
defects. More
than 20,000 cases have been
confirmed in Colombia,

14:51.557 --> 14:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among them some 2,100 pregnant
women.

14:55.161 --> 15:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, Colombian President
Santos sought
major new assistance from
President Obama

15:00.967 --> 15:02.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

15:03.002 --> 15:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Just as the United States has
been Colombia's

15:04.971 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partner in a time of war, I
indicated to President
Santos, we will be your partner
in waging

15:11.711 --> 15:13.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
peace.

15:13.780 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Indeed, over the
past 15 years,
the U.S. has provided almost $10
billion in

15:20.052 --> 15:26.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
anti-narcotics and
counterinsurgency aid through
a program called Plan Colombia.
And at the

15:26.793 --> 15:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cuban talks yesterday, a FARC
leader urged
that the United States
contribute to a lasting

15:32.532 --> 15:34.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
peace.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASTOR ALAPE, Negotiator, FARC:
A country
that was engaged in the conflict
in Colombia

15:38.671 --> 15:43.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should also be engaged in
building a new era,
with resources for peace, for
reconciliation

15:44.076 --> 15:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for the prosperity of all
those who suffered,
with an emphasis on the victims.

15:47.747 --> 15:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, for both
sides in Colombia,
the pieces seem to be falling
into place.

15:53.553 --> 15:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Security Council has
approved a mission
to monitor an eventual
agreement, a move that

15:59.592 --> 16:01.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Santos hailed last week.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President (through
translator): The decision taken
by the Security

16:05.298 --> 16:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Council means that we are no
longer alone.
We have the hand of the United
Nations, of

16:09.936 --> 16:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the whole world in ending this
war. It's the
best guarantee this will happen.

16:14.607 --> 16:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An overall peace
accord could
be finalized as early as next
month.

16:20.313 --> 16:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier today, I sat down with
President Juan
Manuel Santos of Colombia.

16:26.285 --> 16:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome, President Santos, to
the United States.

16:29.856 --> 16:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You come at what many see as a
time of a turning
point for your country. Is that
how you see

16:36.462 --> 16:38.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

16:38.431 --> 16:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Yes. We have
been at war
for 50 years, the only and
longest armed conflict

16:43.903 --> 16:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the whole of the Western
Hemisphere.

16:46.906 --> 16:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're about to sign a peace
agreement
that will end this conflict, so
it is a turning

16:53.713 --> 16:55.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point for Colombia.

16:55.615 --> 17:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How -- Americans
have thought
of Colombia for decades as a
place that is

17:01.921 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run by drug cartels, racked with
internal
conflict. It's hard for them to
understand

17:07.293 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how now there may finally be
peace with these
leftist rebels. How do you
explain that?

17:13.232 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well,
there's been a substantial
change in Colombia, thanks in
many ways to

17:18.704 --> 17:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the help we have received from
the United
States.

17:22.708 --> 17:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Plan Colombia, which was
launched in the
year 2000, was launched was
Colombia was on

17:28.214 --> 17:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the verge of being declared a
failed state.
And, as you say, we were a
country that was

17:34.086 --> 17:39.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
always related to drug
trafficking, violence,
homicides, kidnappings.

17:39.725 --> 17:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, the country is
fundamentally different.
Today, we are leaders in
economic growth,

17:49.602 --> 17:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders in the reduction of
poverty, leaders
in the region in the creation of
employment.

17:55.408 --> 18:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our democracy is working. Our
security has
improved tremendously.

18:01.314 --> 18:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are about to sign a peace
agreement
that will open up opportunities
that Colombia

18:08.654 --> 18:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had never imagined, because most
of Colombians
have lived during all their
lives in a country

18:15.861 --> 18:17.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at war.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the deal is
not done yet.
There are still obstacles that
have to be

18:20.766 --> 18:28.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
overcome. And how do you
reintegrate these
fighters who have spent years
and years thinking

18:28.274 --> 18:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of themselves as opposing the
government?
How do you reintegrate them into
normal society?

18:32.778 --> 18:38.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: We have
experience, because
we have reintegrated more than
50,000 combatants,

18:38.951 --> 18:46.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the former paramilitaries and
members of the
guerrillas. We have demobilized
them and reintegrated

18:46.359 --> 18:48.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into society.

18:48.294 --> 18:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a process, even a
psychological process.
Many times, they have to go back
to school,

18:52.898 --> 18:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids that only know how to
shoot. They were
born in the guerrilla camps. And
these have

18:59.772 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be retrained and reeducated.
And there's
a process. It's cumbersome. It's
difficult,

19:06.245 --> 19:07.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but it's necessary.

19:08.014 --> 19:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're also
asking that this
group, FARC, this -- these rebel
fighters,

19:13.319 --> 19:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be removed from the U.S. list of
terror groups.

19:17.890 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you justify giving a pass
to people
who are responsible for
countless deaths,

19:24.296 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is it, several hundred
thousands deaths
in your country, not to mention
their role

19:29.935 --> 19:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in drug trafficking, cocaine
production? How
do they deserve forgiveness?

19:34.640 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: First of
all, we're not
going to forgive them. The most
responsible

19:40.813 --> 19:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be subject to transitional
justice. They
will be investigated. They will
be judged.

19:46.085 --> 19:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will be condemned, and they
will be sanctioned.

19:50.856 --> 19:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This process is a process with
no impunity.
And we have been taking a lot of
care that

19:56.262 --> 20:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is the case. Now, we're
trying to end
a war, a war that has cost more
than 250,000

20:07.440 --> 20:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people dead, more than seven
million people
displaced. And we have to make
the transition

20:15.347 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to peace.

20:17.216 --> 20:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have to strike a balance.
And that's
what I think we have found, a
correct balance.

20:23.055 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A peace agreement is never
perfect. Always,
you have people from one side or
the other

20:29.762 --> 20:31.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticizing it.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I know you
know, Mr. President,
that you have people in
Colombia, people here

20:33.933 --> 20:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington who are saying
they are troubled
by the idea that not only will
they not face

20:40.306 --> 20:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious retribution, but they --
this actually
will strengthen them, and that
they could

20:43.943 --> 20:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come back to commit terror again
in the future.

20:46.679 --> 20:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: No, because,
if they do
that, they will be -- they will
lose all the

20:51.183 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits. They will go to prison
through ordinary
justice, 50, 60 years in prison.
They know

21:02.294 --> 21:04.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

21:04.196 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I am sure they
will take very
good care of not continuing
their criminal

21:10.803 --> 21:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activities. But what we want is
to finish
the war. We are sitting down
with them from

21:17.510 --> 21:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a position of strength. Ten or
15 years ago,
this would have been impossible.
But I think

21:24.884 --> 21:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my country deserves to have
peace after 50
years of war.

21:29.855 --> 21:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
has already
given Colombia, what, $10
billion over a number

21:36.629 --> 21:43.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of years, so-called Plan
Colombia, you mentioned.
You're asking for more money
from the U.S.

21:43.936 --> 21:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is at a time when, yes,
there may be
the peace deal, but there's
still a serious

21:48.307 --> 21:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem in your country with
cocaine production,
drug trafficking, other issues.
What is the

21:54.413 --> 21:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rationale that the U.S. should
continue to
give money to Colombia?

21:57.683 --> 22:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well, Plan
Colombia is
probably the most successful
bipartisan foreign

22:03.923 --> 22:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy initiative that the U.S.
has launched
in the recent past, in the past
decades. It's

22:10.062 --> 22:11.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very successful.

22:11.897 --> 22:17.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were a country that was
destroyed, the
worst recession ever, on the
verge of being

22:17.703 --> 22:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
declared a failed state. Today,
we are a flourishing
democracy. We have a strong
economy. We have

22:26.111 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progressed tremendously. So,
those are the
results of Plan Colombia.

22:30.382 --> 22:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Plan Colombia allowed us to
and is allowing
us to finish the conflict. And I
think this

22:38.224 --> 22:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the cherry on the cake of
this policy.
Now we have to -- together --
and Colombia

22:43.429 --> 22:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the most important, and I
call it strategic
partner, that the U.S. has south
of Rio Grande.

22:53.939 --> 22:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now the U.S. wants to help
us in the construction
of peace. You end the conflict,
and you start

23:00.079 --> 23:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constructing peace. And that's
why the cooperation
of both countries, because don't
forget 95

23:09.154 --> 23:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of Plan Colombia was
financed by our
own resources.

23:12.157 --> 23:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there anything
hopeful,
quickly, to be said, Mr.
President, about

23:16.695 --> 23:24.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drug, cocaine production,
exportation, the
drug, frankly, crisis that still
exists in

23:24.370 --> 23:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Colombia, and as it affects the
Americas?

23:27.506 --> 23:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Oh. Well, we
have diminished
the number of families that are
dedicated

23:33.345 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the cultivation of the coca
crops by two-thirds.
And we have caught -- we have
interdicted

23:43.355 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more cocaine, for example, last
year than
ever before.

23:47.660 --> 23:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have learned how to dismantle
the big drug
cartels. But if you continue to
demand the

23:56.535 --> 24:03.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cocaine here in the United
States or in Europe,
you will always have somebody to
supply that.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fair point about
the demand.

24:05.444 --> 24:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just finally, Mr. President, you
have a new
worry with the Zika virus.
There's something

24:10.382 --> 24:18.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like 20,000 cases, as we
reported, in your
country, 2,100 women who are
pregnant with

24:18.757 --> 24:19.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this virus.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How are you managing this? How
concerned are
you?

24:22.761 --> 24:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: I am very
concerned, because
this is, for us, something new.
It's new for

24:28.300 --> 24:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world. We know very little
about the Zika
consequences.

24:33.906 --> 24:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have some evidence that a
pregnant
woman might give birth to babies
with a very

24:43.949 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
serious -- a very serious
illness, which is
the microcephaly. We have some
evidence that

24:52.057 --> 25:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this might produce an illness
called Guillain-Barre
in normal persons.

25:00.366 --> 25:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To what extent, how many people
that are infected
by the illness will have these
consequences,

25:07.473 --> 25:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we still don't know. There was a
meeting,
an emergency meeting of all the
health ministers

25:13.245 --> 25:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Uruguay two days ago. We are
monitoring
the situation very closely.

25:19.952 --> 25:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is one of the subjects
that we are
also cooperating with the U.S.
to see if we

25:26.392 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do more research on this
type of illness
to be better prepared for the
future.

25:33.532 --> 25:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We certainly wish
you well
with that, and as we do every
other place

25:38.837 --> 25:39.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's dealing with it.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Juan Manuel Santos, we
thank you
very much.

25:42.207 --> 25:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Thank you
for this opportunity.

25:47.279 --> 26:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, from a conflict
that may
soon end to one that rages still
in Syria.

26:03.595 --> 26:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham has this update
on the five-year
civil war there, and the
international efforts

26:08.801 --> 26:10.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to stop it.

26:10.636 --> 26:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Recriminations
erupted in
full force just one day after
peace talks

26:15.240 --> 26:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stalled in Geneva. Saudi Arabia
and Turkey
blamed heavy new attacks by
Syrian government

26:20.379 --> 26:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forces and Russian airstrikes
for undermining
the diplomatic effort.

26:24.683 --> 26:29.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian army confirmed today
it expects
it will soon surround the city
of Aleppo,

26:29.488 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria's largest city. It's an
advance that
could have far-reaching
consequences.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Faysal Itani is a fellow at the
Atlantic Council
in Washington.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAYSAL ITANI, Atlantic Council:
You're seeing
a general trend of regime
victories. And Aleppo

26:40.866 --> 26:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be a sort of crowning
achievement of
this trend, thanks in large part
to Russian

26:44.970 --> 26:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
air support. There has not yet
been a complete
encirclement of the city, but
the main supply

26:49.641 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line that transfers ammunition,
weapons, other
supplies from Turkey, for
example, to the

26:55.080 --> 26:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rebels who are in Aleppo city
has now been
severed.

26:57.116 --> 27:01.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A
British-based monitoring
group reported today that, over
the past week,

27:02.054 --> 27:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian and Russian warplanes
have mounted
one of the most intense bombing
campaigns

27:05.958 --> 27:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in months. They hit more than
500 opposition
targets throughout Syria, paving
the way for

27:11.063 --> 27:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the offensive north of Aleppo.

27:13.198 --> 27:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That brought warnings today of a
new mass
exodus of refugees.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's prime minister spoke in
London at
a conference on aid for Syrian
refugees.

27:20.739 --> 27:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister: Sixty
thousand to 70,000 people in the
camps in

27:24.610 --> 27:32.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Aleppo are moving towards
Turkey. My
mind is not now in London, but
in our border,

27:32.751 --> 27:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how to relocate these new people
coming from
Syria.

27:35.554 --> 27:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Turkey is
already sheltering
more than 2.5 million Syrians,
making it the

27:40.292 --> 27:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biggest refugee host country in
the world.
The Turkish prime minister
insisted today

27:45.464 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the U.S. take a stronger
stance against
Russian actions in Syria.

27:50.102 --> 27:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In turn, U.S. Secretary of State
John Kasich
said the Russian foreign
minister has now

27:54.206 --> 27:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreed to at least consider a
cease-fire.

27:56.408 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We discussed
and he agreed that we need to
discuss how

28:01.680 --> 28:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to implement cease-fire, and
also how to get
access by both parties. The
opposition needs

28:09.054 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to allow access for humanitarian
assistance,
and the regime in Syria needs to
allow access.

28:15.794 --> 28:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The depth of
that need was
made clear in this drone video
of the devastation

28:20.399 --> 28:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the city of Homs after five
years of civil
war. It was shot by the film
company RussiaWorks.

28:26.872 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Kerry said the 70
donor nations
gathered in London cannot turn
away from the

28:31.109 --> 28:32.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
horror.

28:32.945 --> 28:39.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN KERRY: If people are
reduced to eating
grass and leaves and killing
stray animals

28:39.985 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in order to survive on a
day-to-day basis,
that is something that should
tear at the

28:45.424 --> 28:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conscience of all civilized
people, and we
all have a responsibility to
respond to it.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The conference
ultimately
pledged some $10 billion over
the next four

28:55.067 --> 29:00.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years to assist Syria and
countries like Jordan,
Lebanon, and Turkey. That
brought a glimmer

29:00.739 --> 29:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of hope to some refugees housed
at the sprawling
Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.

29:05.444 --> 29:09.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED NAFEL, Refugee (through
translator):
God willing, this conference
will help us.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need help to feed our
children.

29:11.783 --> 29:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Still, there
is little sign
that the conflict will end soon.
Russia today

29:16.455 --> 29:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accused Turkey of planning its
own invasion
into Syria.

29:19.224 --> 29:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. IGOR KONASHENKOV,
Russian Ministry
of Defense (through translator):
We have serious

29:22.761 --> 29:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grounds to suspect that Turkey
is preparing
for a military incursion. We
have presented

29:27.099 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undeniable evidence to the
international community
proving Turkey opened artillery
fire over

29:32.237 --> 29:34.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a residential area to the north
of Latakia.

29:34.740 --> 29:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And Saudi
Arabia announced
it's poised to send ground
troops into Syria

29:39.311 --> 29:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to join the fight against the
Islamic State.

29:41.780 --> 29:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

29:47.953 --> 29:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:57.496 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Oregon's hidden
canyon; when breath becomes air,
a doctor's

30:03.568 --> 30:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
account of his dying days; and
an essayist
honors the fearlessness of black
artists.

30:09.841 --> 30:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, pro football is
getting ready
to wrap up its season with the
Super Bowl

30:15.113 --> 30:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Sunday. One fan story that
was a big part
of this NFL season was the
furious growth

30:21.620 --> 30:25.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of daily fantasy sports for many
games like
football.

30:25.924 --> 30:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In its short lifespan, that
industry has gained
57 million players. But now
there's rising

30:32.164 --> 30:38.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scrutiny of fantasy sports'
legality from
legislators and regulators
across the country.

30:38.270 --> 30:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
has the story, part of his
series Making Sense,

30:43.208 --> 30:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

30:46.445 --> 30:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It was an ad blitz
to attack
even the most innocent
bystander. Ahead of

30:56.488 --> 31:04.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 2015 NFL season, the two
leading daily
fantasy sports companies,
FanDuel and DraftKings,

31:04.229 --> 31:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aired a national ad every 90
seconds. Together,
they outspent the entire beer
industry in

31:10.268 --> 31:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the month leading up to opening
kickoff, $207
million.

31:15.774 --> 31:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comedian John Oliver made it a
subject of
his weekly HBO show, including
this spoof

31:20.879 --> 31:22.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commercial.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I have been using FanDuel
since I saw
all those commercials on TV all
the (EXPLETIVE

31:24.516 --> 31:25.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DELETED) time.

31:25.851 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Daily fantasy is the best.
I get to play
every day.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: You mean you get to
gamble.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It's not gambling.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Oh, it's definitely
gambling. You have
a massive gambling problem.

31:36.828 --> 31:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It's actually a
skills-based game that
is going to make us rich one
day.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: You're an idiot.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:45.137 --> 31:48.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Journalist Jay
Caspian Kang is
no idiot. I met up with him at
Brooklyn's

31:49.040 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
200 Fifth Avenue Sports Bar,
where the sports
junkie, who played the sites for
17 weeks

31:55.847 --> 31:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wrote about it for "The New
York Times"
magazine, explained that, for
him, too, the

31:59.885 --> 32:01.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
blitz worked.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the ads actually convinced
you, you could
make a million dollars?

32:04.322 --> 32:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG, The New York
Times: No,
no, no, no, no. I'm not -- I
don't think I

32:07.025 --> 32:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that much of a mark, but it
also sort
of showed me that this was like
an actual

32:10.729 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing. It wasn't sort of a shady
underground
gambling sort of operation. And
I think the

32:15.801 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ads made it seem very
legitimate.

32:17.869 --> 32:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: At DraftKings, we play
for glory.

32:20.172 --> 32:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the ads helped
bring 15 million
more players to the game in
2015. There are

32:26.011 --> 32:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now 57 million players in North
America who
pay anywhere from a quarter to
thousands of

32:32.184 --> 32:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars to pick an imaginary
team made up
of real players and compete
online against

32:38.623 --> 32:40.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anonymous strangers.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what I did, with Kang's
help.

32:42.460 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will add LeBron. I want LeBron
James on
my team. I can see already how I
could lose

32:48.300 --> 32:50.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money easily in this.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: Yes. Yes.
People really
enjoy playing these games. I
mean, I enjoyed

32:52.270 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
playing them.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because it gives
you a reason
to root in every single game.

32:56.575 --> 33:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: Sure. But this
is sort of
like normal fantasy sports sped
up on steroids.

33:00.679 --> 33:06.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which is why
FanDuel and DraftKings
have each achieved
billion-dollar valuations.

33:06.785 --> 33:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The potential market is huge.
The companies
have been venture capital
sponges:, $363 million

33:13.859 --> 33:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for FanDuel and $426 million for
DraftKings,
including legal investments from
the National

33:20.332 --> 33:26.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Basketball Association,
NBC/Comcast, Major
League Baseball and FOX Sports.

33:26.471 --> 33:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, when Congress proclaimed
that fantasy
sports were not gambling back in
2006, the

33:32.277 --> 33:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
field was dominated by office
pools and friendly
contests, like in the longtime
sitcom "The

33:38.116 --> 33:39.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
League."

33:40.051 --> 33:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: He's a fantasy football
genius, OK?
No wife, no job, just pure
football knowledge.

33:44.456 --> 33:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But a host of
states are now
challenging daily fantasy
sports. Some have

33:49.828 --> 33:55.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outright banned it, including
Nevada, which
has a gambling industry of its
own to protect.

33:55.934 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DraftKings didn't respond to our
requests
for an interview, and FanDuel
wouldn't speak

34:00.739 --> 34:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to us on camera. But this isn't
gambling,
FanDuel's Matt King told PBS'
"Frontline."

34:06.044 --> 34:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So you don't view what
you do here
at FanDuel as gambling?

34:11.816 --> 34:13.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT KING, FanDuel: No.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: That's a word that
isn't used very
much around here, I take it.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MATT KING: No.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Jason Robins, CEO
of DraftKings,
says it's skill.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON ROBINS, CEO, DraftKings: I
just think,
under the current law right now,
it's very

34:22.427 --> 34:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obvious that this fits within
skill gaming.

34:24.696 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hey, says Jay
Caspian Kang, of
course, it's gambling, but the
industry's

34:29.301 --> 34:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defense, the role of skill, is
legit. Only
problem is that, besides
addictiveness, fantasy

34:36.141 --> 34:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sports skill is why it's a
loser's game.

34:39.044 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: It takes a lot
of research,
it takes a lot of study, it
takes a lot of

34:43.548 --> 34:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding breaking news
things. So, if
you hear it from a beat
reporter, let's say,

34:49.421 --> 34:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the New England Patriots
that Julian Edelman,
one of the wide receivers, is
injured, you

34:55.427 --> 34:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to know instinctively what
that means
for the other wide receivers in
terms of how

34:59.097 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
many times Tom Brady, the
quarterback, is
going to throw to them.

35:01.800 --> 35:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And who does this
kind of work?
Math jocks, several dozen of
whom Kang met

35:06.905 --> 35:08.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with for his story.

35:08.740 --> 35:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: Some of them
are guys who
worked on Wall Street and were
investment

35:14.612 --> 35:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
analysts, and a lot of them, I
think, are
just guys who are of sort of
good at sports

35:18.550 --> 35:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statistics and that they found a
way to turn
this into a living.

35:22.087 --> 35:27.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Such researchers
are essentially
gambling pros, much like
professional stock

35:27.592 --> 35:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investors, using high-frequency
trading software
called scripting that analyzes
vast amounts

35:33.832 --> 35:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of data instantly, creates teams
automatically,
and can thus play multiple
entries.

35:39.704 --> 35:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: Those $2
competitions and
$5 competitions, $10, $20
competitions are

35:43.942 --> 35:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blanketed with thousands of
entries from one
person, or two people who are
very, very -- who

35:50.348 --> 35:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have put in a lot of time and
effort into
building these lineups, who use
software that

35:55.320 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you don't even know exists to
optimize those
lineups.

35:58.123 --> 36:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their goal is to just take
your $2. And
if there's 1,000 of you, then
they have got

36:04.129 --> 36:05.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
$2,000.

36:06.031 --> 36:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: When it came time
to enter my
$5 basketball lineup, I sifted
through hundreds

36:10.402 --> 36:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of players and their stats,
defaulted mostly
to my home team Boston Celtics.

36:15.974 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DraftKings says it's banned
scripting and
limited entries, but pros
already seemed to

36:21.079 --> 36:22.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be there six hours before
tipoff.

36:23.081 --> 36:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: This guy is
one of the most
famous users, Youdacao.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Youdacao. He's got
100 entries.

36:27.652 --> 36:28.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:28.720 --> 36:30.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: ... entries in
there, right.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Schmeckl (ph) is another
relatively famous
player. He has 100 entries.

36:33.024 --> 36:37.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: One hundred
entries, yes, 100
entries at $5.

36:37.128 --> 36:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: At five bucks.
Again, this
is for $5, right?

36:40.165 --> 36:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And who knows how
many other
names Youdacao or Schmeckl may
be using?

36:45.837 --> 36:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Small wonder a report from the
consulting
firm McKinsey found that, for
Major League

36:50.475 --> 36:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baseball, 91 percent of profits
were won by
just 1.3 percent of players.

36:56.815 --> 37:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, hey, I just needed to
finish in the top
7,000 to double my five bucks.
The clock was

37:03.088 --> 37:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ticking. I placed my bet, as a
journalist.

37:05.924 --> 37:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as things stand now, if I
wanted to play,
you would discourage me from
doing it?

37:11.796 --> 37:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: Not morally.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, not morally.

37:14.866 --> 37:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: No, but...

37:15.900 --> 37:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Prudently, in terms
of prudence.

37:17.735 --> 37:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: Yes. If you
just want to
spend $200 or $50 and have fun,
you know,

37:22.941 --> 37:24.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then I think it's fine.

37:24.776 --> 37:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you feel like you want to
enter a fair
betting economy, and you want to
have as good

37:31.349 --> 37:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a shot as they are telling you
that you have,
then I would say that this is a
very bad bet.

37:35.653 --> 37:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or, as New York
Attorney General
Eric Schneiderman put it: "Daily
fantasy sports

37:41.092 --> 37:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rely on a steady stream of
minnows to feed
the sharks."

37:44.996 --> 37:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with states stacking up
against them and
the minnows increasingly aware
of the bigger

37:50.135 --> 37:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fish, Kang says online poker's
fate should
give fair warning to fantasy
sports.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY CASPIAN KANG: All that was
left were great
players with a lot of money
playing against

37:59.577 --> 38:03.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one another and taking each
other's bankrolls
and passing them back and forth.

38:03.648 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daily fantasy sports, I think,
is at a risk
of having that happen within
like a season

38:08.553 --> 38:10.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or so.

38:10.355 --> 38:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And thus a recent
pledge from
FanDuel may be a bid for
self-preservation

38:14.559 --> 38:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "We do believe that
new commonsense
regulations to protect consumers
are needed."

38:21.432 --> 38:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what else? Well, I'm sure
you're dying
to know whether my NBA lineup
made the top

38:26.804 --> 38:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
7,000. Turns out I finished
15,550th.

38:31.576 --> 38:39.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour" in
Brooklyn, this is
so-called economics
correspondent Paul Solman,

38:39.484 --> 38:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with once-high hopes and $25,
now down to
$20.

38:52.764 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There are few places
left that
haven't been explored. But a
team in Oregon

39:01.673 --> 39:07.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has documented a natural wonder
for the first
time that's just about 60 miles
from Portland.

39:08.012 --> 39:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a spectacular half-mile
gorge and narrow
canyon in the Cascade Range.

39:13.151 --> 39:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was first spotted in 2010 by
a Forest Service
employee. This past summer, an
expedition

39:19.090 --> 39:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team spent three days navigating
through it,
including nine major waterfalls
and a grotto

39:25.063 --> 39:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that ended at a slot canyon.

39:27.865 --> 39:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oregon Public Broadcasting
chronicled that
effort in a new documentary.

39:31.669 --> 39:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's an excerpt about trying
to reach the
Valhalla Canyon.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Oh, man.

39:37.442 --> 39:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CANALES, Photographer: Being
in Valhalla,
it feels like you have gone into
the throat

39:42.981 --> 39:46.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of something, through the
stomach and you're
in it. You know, for myself, as
I would say

39:46.618 --> 39:51.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more a normal person and
not a hard-core
adventurer, there's kind of just
a low level

39:51.823 --> 39:54.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of panic at the back of the
mind.

39:54.859 --> 40:05.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like, this is not normal.
What's going
to happen here? What's going to
happen there?

40:05.103 --> 40:08.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes! It's awesome!

40:08.840 --> 40:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CANALES: And so there's kind
of always
a little fight to keep that
quelled down.

40:16.080 --> 40:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's just this
thrilling excitement
at the rugged beauty of it. All
the fears

40:28.760 --> 40:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just disappeared, and it was
like, this is
awesome. You know, the worry was
gone, and

40:38.836 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was just pure adventure.

40:42.106 --> 40:49.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: As we're moving down
through, all of
a sudden, it just opens up into
this remarkable,

40:50.048 --> 40:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beautiful amphitheater, just,
like, huge,
towering walls on either side of
you. There's

40:58.856 --> 41:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just big, mossy, pour-overs,
water spilling
and trickling in all these
places. And there's

41:05.763 --> 41:11.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ferns and moss and green. And
it's just a
strikingly beautiful place. We
named that

41:11.836 --> 41:13.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cathedral Garden.

41:13.638 --> 41:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CANALES: Oh, my God, walking
into that
space was jaw-dropping. I have
not been in

41:22.413 --> 41:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a place like that in Oregon
before. And it
just had that open-air mystical,
like, giant

41:29.420 --> 41:31.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
feeling.

41:31.122 --> 41:36.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it kind of took on a
spiritual moment
in there. Like, no one wanted to
talk loud

41:36.527 --> 41:42.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the beginning. You know,
like, we were
just so impressed by it.

41:43.034 --> 41:51.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Valhalla!

41:52.009 --> 42:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: All they had to do now
was get through
one more night.

42:00.251 --> 42:06.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The walls are so steep over
the top of
us, and there is rockfall in
this area. And,

42:06.424 --> 42:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again, there's no other place to
camp.

42:09.494 --> 42:17.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CANALES: And it's, like,
we're in this.
This precarious situation is the
safest alternative.

42:17.435 --> 42:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whatever happens, it's going
to happen.
It makes me feel wonderfully
small in this

42:25.510 --> 42:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place. It's like this comforting
reprioritization
of where we fit in nature and
the food chain

42:34.051 --> 42:43.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of things.

42:43.127 --> 42:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What makes a life
worth living?
What gives it meaning? And how
does that change

42:56.808 --> 43:02.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the time one has left
collapses? These
are some of the profound
questions taken up

43:02.246 --> 43:06.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a new memoir by a doctor who
suddenly faced
his own mortality.

43:06.617 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our newest
addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

43:10.188 --> 43:16.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: As a
neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi
was used to dealing with
life-and-death issues.

43:16.194 --> 43:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was, by his own account, a
driven man who
studied literature and
philosophy before turning

43:21.432 --> 43:24.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to medicine, earning five
degrees along the
way.

43:25.002 --> 43:31.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was near completion of a
rigorous residency
at Stanford when, at age 36, he
got a diagnosis

43:31.108 --> 43:32.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of lung cancer.

43:33.044 --> 43:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL KALANITHI, Author, "When
Breath Becomes
Air": Five years down the line,
I don't know

43:34.879 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what I will be doing. I may be
dead. I may
not be.

43:38.416 --> 43:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He would live
just 22 months
more, and in that time have a
child with his

43:43.187 --> 43:47.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wife, Lucy, and write an
indelible memoir,
"When Breath Becomes Air."

43:47.792 --> 43:50.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI, Widow of
Paul Kalanithi:
He had thought maybe he would
have a long

43:50.561 --> 43:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
career as a neurosurgeon or a
scientist and
then maybe a writer.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He had planned on
all this,
right?

43:55.967 --> 44:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: That's
right. He said:
"I think I may be years into my
retirement

44:00.438 --> 44:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, at age 36. And so what do I
want to do?"
And the answer was write.

44:04.675 --> 44:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lucy Kalanithi is
also a doctor.
The two met at Yale Medical
School and were

44:09.747 --> 44:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
married nine years before Paul's
death in
2015.

44:12.817 --> 44:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: He was sort
of a perpetual
learner and a seeker and
somebody who was

44:19.557 --> 44:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very interested in kind of
understanding what
it is to be human and what makes
-- what sort

44:25.496 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of makes life meaningful. And he
approached
that...

44:27.598 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: From the
beginning, right?

44:28.566 --> 44:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: That's
right, yes.

44:29.166 --> 44:30.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

44:31.068 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: He went to
grad school
in English literature, and sort
of made his

44:33.170 --> 44:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way into neuroscience because he
wanted a
real understanding of kind of
consciousness

44:38.109 --> 44:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what makes us human. So he
kind of came
at that from different angles.

44:42.380 --> 44:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the themes
that comes
through clearly in his life and
his book is

44:46.717 --> 44:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
identity, right, is sort what
makes us, us.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: Yes.

44:50.888 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when you have a brain
disorder or
you're having surgery on your
brain, you are

44:54.225 --> 44:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking about questions like,
will this affect
my language, will this affect my
personality,

44:59.730 --> 45:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just, how does this illness
affect my
body in other ways?

45:03.668 --> 45:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's kind of a very intense
place for decision-making
about identity. And he was very
interested

45:08.973 --> 45:10.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in that.

45:10.908 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then, of
course, it happens
to him. And he starts -- as he's
dying, he's

45:12.910 --> 45:19.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking about, if you're dying,
rather than
living, in a sense, then are you
still you?

45:19.150 --> 45:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: In the
moment of diagnoses,
he sort of saw his life
trajectory and his

45:24.055 --> 45:29.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
self kind of come tumbling down.
He wasn't
going to be a neurosurgeon for
years and years.

45:29.226 --> 45:33.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we thought initially that he
actually
had less time to live. We
thought he might

45:33.764 --> 45:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have months or less than a year.
And then
he started a therapy that
allowed him a lot

45:38.436 --> 45:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more kind of functionality than
he expected
and a longer prognosis
potentially. And so

45:42.940 --> 45:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then it was this big question
of, I don't
know how much time I have left
and how do

45:47.278 --> 45:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I spend that time? Who am I?

45:49.046 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Paul spoke of
this in a video
released by his publisher.

45:51.983 --> 45:58.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL KALANITHI: It's a careful
load to balance.
If you don't think about the bad
case, that

45:58.155 --> 46:00.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ending is going to be very rough
on you and
your family.

46:00.725 --> 46:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you don't think about the
good case,
you're going to miss an
opportunity to really

46:05.296 --> 46:08.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make the most out of your life
and time.

46:08.299 --> 46:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, one of
the things
that struck me also here is, he
learns a lot

46:14.472 --> 46:17.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about doctoring, right, that he
had never
seen as a doctor.

46:17.141 --> 46:19.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: Yes, yes,
yes.

46:19.110 --> 46:22.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He writes, for
example, at
one point, "Realizing how little
doctors understand

46:22.146 --> 46:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hells through for which we
put patients."

46:24.115 --> 46:26.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was really getting to see
things from a
different side.

46:26.550 --> 46:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: He had been
in medicine
for a decade as a student and
then a resident,

46:30.921 --> 46:35.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but all these tiny little
experiences -- like,
as an example, when you get an
I.V. and they

46:35.760 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start infusing normal saline
into your vein,
you can taste the salt.

46:39.964 --> 46:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said: "I have been a
doctor for a decade,
and I never knew you could taste
the salt."

46:43.434 --> 46:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's all these tiny details
that sort
of come to the fore. And that's
not even to

46:48.305 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mention the physical and
emotional suffering
that comes with being sick and
the way it

46:53.844 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rocks you and rocks your family.
So, yes,
we really kind of felt that.

46:58.716 --> 47:04.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He could look at
it intellectually,
but he also then had to look at
it very realistically.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: Yes.

47:06.323 --> 47:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we got the news of this
terrible chest
X-ray that looked really kind of
dense with

47:10.294 --> 47:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tumors, and kind of helped
explain why he
had been having weight loss and
back pain

47:14.532 --> 47:20.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and real kind of health troubles
for a few
months, both of us knew that the
next day

47:20.204 --> 47:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were going to the hospital.
He would have
a C.T. scan and it would likely
show metastatic

47:24.475 --> 47:26.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer.

47:26.310 --> 47:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being doctors, we could see that
path. And
when we packed for the hospital,
I was packing

47:30.648 --> 47:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
socks and pillows and phone
chargers, and
he just packed three books. He
packed "Mere

47:37.254 --> 47:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christianity" by C.S. Lewis,
Heidegger's "Being
and Time," and Solzhenitsyn's
"Cancer Ward."

47:44.295 --> 47:48.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it was that
transition right away
where he said: "This is becoming
so personal

47:48.799 --> 47:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I need my books. Like, I
need to understand
this through literature."

47:54.138 --> 47:58.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he became ill, he kind of
translated
the experience back into writing
and words

47:58.242 --> 48:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make sense of it. And this
book is part
of that.

48:01.145 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what about
for you? What
did you feel when you read it?

48:02.847 --> 48:05.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: So, I read
it in real
time, as he was writing it.

48:05.649 --> 48:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would read it daily or weekly.
And it was
kind of a great communication
tool for us,

48:10.321 --> 48:10.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actually.

48:11.021 --> 48:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, really?

48:12.356 --> 48:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: Because he
would talk
about -- oh, yes.

48:14.258 --> 48:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seeing him write the book was
really amazing,
because even though his body was
sort of in

48:16.227 --> 48:24.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this state of physical collapse,
his mind
was so engaged, still, in this
process.

48:24.401 --> 48:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And kind of the reviews of the
book that I
like the best capture that
somewhat. There's

48:29.340 --> 48:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an author named Gavin Francis
who wrote a
blurb for the book. And he wrote
something

48:32.843 --> 48:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, "This is a tremendous
book, crackling
with life."

48:36.881 --> 48:41.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that idea, like, it brings
tears to my
eyes to think of crackling with
life, because,

48:41.285 --> 48:44.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you had seen Paul, you know,
he's wrapped
up in a blanket, he's sitting in
this armchair.

48:44.755 --> 48:47.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He looks frail and wan, you
know? He looks
ill.

48:48.025 --> 48:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As he's writing?

48:49.927 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: But he's
crackling with
life. And that was just really
true. And the

48:54.331 --> 48:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
book was a big part of that.

48:56.367 --> 49:01.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The two of you
made a very
important, major decision in the
midst of

49:02.039 --> 49:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this, which was to have a child.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: That's
right.

49:04.942 --> 49:07.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was that a tough
decision?

49:07.178 --> 49:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: We had
always wanted to
have children together. We
hadn't done it

49:12.483 --> 49:16.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the end of his residency.
That was around
the time we had pictured we
always would.

49:16.520 --> 49:22.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right at that time was when
he was diagnosed
with terminal cancer, terminal
lung cancer.

49:22.459 --> 49:27.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a series of really
intense conversations
to figure out if we wanted to do
that and

49:27.531 --> 49:31.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could we handle that, and both
of us had the
instinct to do it.

49:31.735 --> 49:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we needed to think very hard
about what
it would mean. You know, we
talked really

49:35.539 --> 49:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly about his prognosis and
what was happening.
And I said that, "Don't you
think that saying

49:39.777 --> 49:42.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goodbye to a child would make
your death even
more painful?"

49:42.880 --> 49:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, "Well, wouldn't it
be great if
it did?"

49:45.749 --> 49:52.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL KALANITHI: Since Cady's
birth, my time
with her has had a very peculiar
and free

49:52.590 --> 49:59.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nature. In all probability, I
won't live long
enough for her to remember me,
and so the

49:59.563 --> 50:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time is -- just is what it is.

50:01.365 --> 50:03.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: That was
kind of this
amazing thing, where it's like
life isn't

50:04.068 --> 50:08.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just about avoiding suffering.
It's about
finding meaning. And having a
child was part

50:08.105 --> 50:09.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that for us.

50:09.940 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The very powerful
book is "When
Breath Becomes Air" by Paul
Kalanithi.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lucy Kalanithi, thank you so
much.

50:16.313 --> 50:27.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LUCY KALANITHI: My pleasure.
I wish it
were Paul here. Thank you.

50:27.291 --> 50:40.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally, the latest
installment
of Brief But Spectacular, our
series where

50:40.871 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

50:43.807 --> 50:48.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from writer
Rachel Kaadzi
Ghansah, a "New York Times"
magazine contributor

50:48.946 --> 50:55.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and author of the forthcoming
book "The Explainers
and the Explorers." Her essays
on uncompromising

50:55.552 --> 50:58.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
artists of color have earned
critical acclaim.

50:58.522 --> 51:01.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here, she speaks about
fearlessness and black
art.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL KAADZI GHANSAH, Author,
"The Explainers
and the Explorers": I like
writing about people

51:04.194 --> 51:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who look like me and the people
I know who
don't have good pieces written
about them,

51:09.566 --> 51:12.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because we deserve it.

51:12.870 --> 51:22.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have written about Jimi
Hendrix, Electric
Lady Studios, Toni Morrison,
Kendrick Lamar,

51:22.680 --> 51:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Watts riots, Trayvon Martin,
Rachel Jeantel,
Dave Chappelle.

51:26.984 --> 51:31.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't always hear about the
people who
we know as legends the ways that
they were

51:32.089 --> 51:36.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very true to themselves. I'm
more interested
in the moments when they were
uncompromising

51:36.327 --> 51:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they were fearless, because
what I hope
is that that fearlessness tells
us a little

51:41.098 --> 51:42.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bit about how we can be
fearless.

51:43.067 --> 51:47.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was interesting to me about
Dave Chappelle
is, here is a moment where
typically walking

51:47.471 --> 51:52.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
away from Comedy Central,
walking away from
your career would be a bad
decision, and anyone

51:52.910 --> 51:58.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would tell you, don't do that.
The common
understanding of it is, is that
he felt that

51:58.349 --> 52:02.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the show had started to cross a
line, and
that it was actually becoming a
source of

52:02.987 --> 52:08.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embarrassment. And so walking
away from $50
million was pretty heroic and
pretty decent

52:08.993 --> 52:10.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and full of integrity.

52:10.861 --> 52:14.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you know, I couldn't read
until I was
12. And maybe I wasn't 12, but I
was older.

52:14.965 --> 52:18.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people start reading
when they're
5 or something. And so books
were kind of

52:18.335 --> 52:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this phantasmagorical space that
I couldn't
enter because my mom could read.
My dad was

52:24.875 --> 52:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an academic. Everyone was so
intelligent.
And I couldn't go there.

52:28.479 --> 52:33.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the moment I could, I just
started to
read ravenously. One of the
books that I remember

52:33.584 --> 52:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changing everyone's lives was
"Beloved." That
was the first time people who
had been silenced,

52:41.225 --> 52:43.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enslaved people, became human.

52:43.727 --> 52:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at that moment, I said,
this is what
a writer can do. And, so, for
me, Toni Morrison

52:50.267 --> 52:56.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't exist on a human plane.
She almost
exists in this odd, spiritual,
otherworld,

52:56.240 --> 53:02.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of her work. And when
she won that
Nobel Prize, what was
interesting is that

53:02.913 --> 53:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of prominent newspapers
asked, does
this woman deserve it?

53:07.718 --> 53:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I had the moment to
take the "New
York Times" magazine cover, I
decided I'm

53:13.157 --> 53:17.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to take that cover to lay
flowers at
the feet of this woman and say,
not only did

53:17.795 --> 53:20.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you deserve it, but thank you.

53:20.330 --> 53:25.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My name is Rachel Kaadzi
Ghansah, and this
is my Brief But Spectacular take
on fearlessness

53:25.969 --> 53:27.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and black art.

53:27.871 --> 53:31.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:36.814 --> 53:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, Miles O'Brien reports

at the center of the Zika
outbreak.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks.

53:47.291 --> 54:13.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
