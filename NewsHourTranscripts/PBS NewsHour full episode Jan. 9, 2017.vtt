JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.608 --> 00:11.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour":
President-elect Donald
Trump names his son-in-law a
senior White

00:11.345 --> 00:14.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House adviser, sparking concerns
of nepotism.

00:14.915 --> 00:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talk with Trump senior
adviser Kellyanne
Conway about how this and why
some Cabinet

00:20.787 --> 00:24.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nominees have incomplete
background checks.

00:24.124 --> 00:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, a look at President
Obama's health
care legacy, the biggest and
most controversial

00:29.529 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pieces of his administration.

00:32.299 --> 00:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the children of the camps --
what life
is like for the Iraqi kids who
are growing

00:37.571 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up as collateral damage of war.

00:39.806 --> 00:45.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAULID WARFA, UNICEF: What
worries me the
most is to have these children
roaming around

00:45.312 --> 00:49.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with no proper schooling, with
no proper protection,
losing their future.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.253 --> 00:56.490 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.523 --> 01:10.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A crush of
confirmation hearings
begins tomorrow for team Trump,
but the focus

01:10.904 --> 01:15.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight is on someone who's not
subject to
Senate confirmation.

01:15.175 --> 01:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a close relative of the
president-elect,
and the transition announced
this evening

01:19.947 --> 01:22.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's getting a top White House
slot.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:24.418 --> 01:30.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Throughout the
campaign, Jared
Kushner had Donald Trump's ear
and now the

01:30.290 --> 01:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president wants him to follow
him to the White
House as a top adviser.

01:34.227 --> 01:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like the president-elect,
Kushner, who turns
36 tomorrow, is the son of a
real estate magnate.

01:40.033 --> 01:47.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He became CEO of Kushner
Companies, his father's
multibillion-dollar business, in
2008.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 2009, he married Ivanka
Trump.

01:49.943 --> 01:55.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump insiders credit Kushner
with restructuring
and modernizing his
father-in-law's campaign.

01:55.849 --> 02:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During the transition, he's been
involved
in key personnel decisions.

02:00.354 --> 02:05.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger
told "Forbes" magazine: "Every
president I

02:05.425 --> 02:10.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have ever known has one or two
people he intuitively
and structurally trusts.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Jared might be that
person."

02:14.101 --> 02:18.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even with president-elect
Trump's confidence,
Kushner could face hurdles
before he can assume

02:18.772 --> 02:20.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a White House post.

02:20.440 --> 02:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They arise from both who he is
and what he
owns.

02:24.111 --> 02:30.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A 1967 federal law bars
officials from appointing
relatives to any agency they
control.

02:30.684 --> 02:34.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not clear whether it
applies to White
House jobs.

02:34.287 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Kushner's lawyer argues
it doesn't
and said Kushner won't be taking
a salary.

02:39.493 --> 02:44.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Kushner's business
holdings, a senior
transition official said he will
resign as

02:44.097 --> 02:50.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CEO and divest from a
significant number of
assets, including foreign
investments.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

02:52.639 --> 02:56.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will get the
Trump team's
perspective on this and other
issues right

02:57.010 --> 02:58.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

02:58.845 --> 03:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Russia
pushed back
against a U.S. intelligence
report that it

03:03.316 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meddled in the presidential
campaign.

03:05.619 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report last week said
President Vladimir
Putin personally ordered the
effort.

03:10.323 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a Kremlin spokesman said
the investigation
is "reminiscent of a
witch-hunt," echoing

03:16.430 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language that president-elect
Trump used last
week.

03:19.599 --> 03:24.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
still don't know
what data those who make such
unfounded accusations

03:24.671 --> 03:26.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still strongly reject any
involvement of
Moscow and accusations that
Russian officials

03:30.110 --> 03:33.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or institutions were involved in
any hacker
attacks.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are observing a serious
fatigue with these
accusations.

03:36.683 --> 03:40.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump today
deflected questions
today about the hacking.

03:40.987 --> 03:44.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "We will
talk to you about
that at another time."

03:44.124 --> 03:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He holds his news conference
since the election
on Wednesday.

03:49.396 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China warned president-elect
Donald Trump
today that it will "take
revenge" if he reneges

03:54.668 --> 03:57.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the so-called one China
policy.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That doctrine treats Taiwan as
part of China.

04:00.774 --> 04:06.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The threat from Chinese
state-run media came
after the Taiwanese president
made a weekend

04:06.346 --> 04:10.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stopover in Houston, Texas, and
met with Republican
lawmakers.

04:10.984 --> 04:15.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has spoken with the
Taiwanese leader,
and at one point, appeared to
suggest that

04:15.889 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the one-China policy might need
reconsidering.

04:19.626 --> 04:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man accused of killing five
people at
the Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
airport had

04:24.231 --> 04:27.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his first appearance in federal
court today.

04:27.100 --> 04:33.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to court documents,
Esteban Santiago
has admitted to the fatal
shooting last Friday.

04:33.273 --> 04:38.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the hearing today, the Iraq
War veteran
said he understood the charges
against him,

04:38.211 --> 04:40.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which carry the death penalty.

04:40.947 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Northern California and Nevada
are facing
what could be their worst flood
disaster in

04:46.052 --> 04:47.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the last decade.

04:47.821 --> 04:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A powerful storm system moved in
over the
weekend, unleashing heavy
downpours and strong

04:53.326 --> 04:55.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winds.

04:55.128 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it forced some 1,300
residents in Reno,
Nevada, to evacuate after the
Truckee River

05:00.600 --> 05:02.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overflowed.

05:02.369 --> 05:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm also blew down a giant
California
sequoia that is famed for a
tunnel carved

05:07.974 --> 05:09.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into its truck.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It had stood for centuries.

05:12.012 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The musical "La La Land" swept
seven Golden
Globe film awards.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the ceremony also touched
off a war of
words with president-elect
Trump.

05:21.354 --> 05:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It started with actress Meryl
Streep and her
speech accepting a lifetime
achievement award.

05:27.260 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She deplored Mr. Trump's
imitating a disabled
reporter during the primaries.

05:32.465 --> 05:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MERYL STREEP, Actress: And this
instinct to
humiliate, when it's modeled by
someone in

05:40.340 --> 05:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public platform, by someone
powerful,
it filters down into everybody's
life, because

05:45.745 --> 05:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it kind of gives permission for
other people
to do the same thing.

05:49.950 --> 05:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the powerful use their
position to bully
others, we all lose.

05:54.421 --> 05:57.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
president-elect fired back
on Twitter today.

05:57.791 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called Streep -- quote --
"one of the most
overrated actresses in
Hollywood" and -- quote

06:03.029 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "a Hillary flunky who lost
big."

06:06.399 --> 06:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also tweeted praise
for Fiat Chrysler's
decision to build new jeeps and
a truck in

06:12.872 --> 06:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Midwestern U.S., instead of
Mexico.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The company said it's creating
2,000 jobs.

06:18.178 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, meanwhile,
stocks followed
oil prices lower.

06:22.816 --> 06:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 76 points
to close at 19887.

06:27.354 --> 06:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 10 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped eight.

06:34.060 --> 06:39.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I sit down
with senior Trump adviser
Kellyanne Conway;

06:39.132 --> 06:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our Politics Monday duo take on
a packed week
for the president-elect; a look
at the legacy

06:44.704 --> 06:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of President Obama's health care
overhaul;
and much more.

06:59.653 --> 07:05.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last day has seen a rise in
both concern
over and defense of
president-elect Trump's

07:05.625 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cabinet nominees after news that
some of them
have not completed ethics
reviews.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

07:13.333 --> 07:18.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The
president-elect walked
out of Trump Tower with a
business leader,

07:18.705 --> 07:24.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jack Ma of the Chinese
e-commerce giant Alibaba,
but his words were about
politics and his

07:24.511 --> 07:25.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cabinet nominees.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I think
they will all pass.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That after
Trump met with
a key ally, Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell,

07:31.951 --> 07:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who dismissed concerns about
vetting.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: Yes,
everybody will be properly
vetted, as they

07:37.357 --> 07:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been in the past, and I'm
hopeful that
we will get up to six or seven
picks of the

07:40.894 --> 07:43.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national security team in place
on day one.

07:43.496 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this ahead
of a packed
week, with two confirmation
hearings set for

07:47.434 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow, five more set for
Wednesday, and
at least three slated for
Thursday.

07:53.006 --> 07:58.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But "NewsHour" learned that
education secretary-designate
Betsy DeVos and three other
Trump nominees

07:58.378 --> 08:01.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have not yet cleared an ethics
review.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats with their Senate
leader, Chuck
Schumer, called it a rush job.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Jamming
all these hearings into one or
two days, making

08:08.688 --> 08:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members run from committee to
committee makes
no sense.

08:13.159 --> 08:18.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if it takes a few weeks to
get through
them all in order to carefully
consider their

08:18.331 --> 08:20.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominations, that is well worth
it.

08:20.767 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Schumer has
threatened to
slow down the Senate
confirmation process

08:24.437 --> 08:27.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if senators don't have all the
nominees' information.

08:27.941 --> 08:33.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Republicans point to
2009, when
the hearing schedule was nearly
as packed,

08:33.413 --> 08:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 14 Obama nominees, like
Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton and Attorney
General Eric

08:38.585 --> 08:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Holder, were confirmed in the
first nine days
after inauguration.

08:43.390 --> 08:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now that is being called the
Obama treatment,
relatively fast confirmation.

08:47.727 --> 08:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democrats say the difference
is that President
Obama's nominees all cleared
their ethics

08:52.966 --> 08:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
review process before their
hearings, even
before they were announced.

08:56.703 --> 09:01.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Office of Government Ethics
says some
Trump nominees have not even
filed their paperwork

09:01.141 --> 09:02.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, thank
you for that
report, but take us through this
process.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What exactly is required of
these nominees?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, it
depends on what
committee you're going in front
of.

09:10.417 --> 09:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take you through what everyone
is required
of, first of all, three things.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every one of these nominees has
to have an
FBI background check, they have
to have given

09:17.957 --> 09:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial disclosures to their
committee of
choice -- or the committee that
oversees their

09:22.429 --> 09:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomination, and they have to
fill out a committee
questionnaire.

09:24.798 --> 09:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, what depends on each
committee
is the following, whether or not
an ethics

09:30.236 --> 09:33.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
review must be filed before a
hearing or simply
before a vote.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It must be filed at some time.

09:35.208 --> 09:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's why we see these
hearings this
week before the ethics reviews
are all in.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, only three committees
require tax forms
from the past.

09:43.450 --> 09:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell us a little
more about
what is missing for some of
these nominees.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These ethics
forms that we're
talking about are significant.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are two pieces to them.

09:52.826 --> 09:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the financial disclosure,
and the second
is a letter in which each
nominee has to state

09:57.464 --> 10:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any potential conflict of
interest with their
future job and more importantly
what they're

10:01.768 --> 10:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to do to make sure the
conflict of interest
doesn't matter.

10:04.571 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, Rex Tillerson
filed in his letter,
which we now have, that he will
go ahead and

10:09.175 --> 10:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just not get a salary from
ExxonMobil,
but any future bonuses which
were significant,

10:15.348 --> 10:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's going to now sever ties
with altogether
from ExxonMobil.

10:18.518 --> 10:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as we have
been saying,
some of these nominees have
these very complicated

10:22.655 --> 10:24.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financial backgrounds.

10:24.357 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask you about what the
director
of the Office of Government
Ethics wrote in

10:29.028 --> 10:30.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a letter this weekend.

10:30.797 --> 10:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, to his knowledge, never
in the 40
years has a nominee gone before
a hearing

10:35.535 --> 10:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without having their ethics
review completed.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that your understanding?

10:39.506 --> 10:42.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's
extraordinary coming
from an ethics office, words
like that.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Almost.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans say there is one
example where
a hearing has been held of a
nominee who did

10:46.946 --> 10:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not file their ethics paperwork.

10:49.115 --> 10:50.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is Rod Paige.

10:50.450 --> 10:55.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was George W. Bush's
education nominee
way back in 2001.

10:55.088 --> 10:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His ethics paperwork came eight
days after
his hearing, but, again,
importantly, Judy,

10:59.626 --> 11:01.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
before the vote.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all of this, I think, Judy,
the bottom
line is senators are questioning
nominees

11:04.097 --> 11:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now before they have some of
their paperwork.

11:06.432 --> 11:10.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And again only
one in 40 years?

11:10.703 --> 11:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this Office of Government
Ethics reviews
thousands of government
appointees, every

11:16.776 --> 11:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cabinet nominee in the last 40
years.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is only one exception
that we know
of to this rule until now.

11:22.348 --> 11:28.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I guess one
bottom line, Lisa,
is, could these nominees go
ahead and be subject

11:29.022 --> 11:32.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to a Senate vote if that
approval material,
or that ethics approval is not
done?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The answer is
no.

11:34.761 --> 11:38.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason is both Mitch
McConnell, the
Republican leader, and the
Democratic leader,

11:38.464 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Schumer, have said that
they want all
of this paperwork in before the
full Senate

11:42.869 --> 11:43.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, again, this is the review
time.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the chance when senators
can actually
scrutinize these nominees.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're doing it in some
cases without
the full set of information to
ask questions

11:53.880 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, a
question you and
I were discussing, we know
Donald Trump talked

11:59.118 --> 12:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his campaign about changing
the way Washington
works.

12:03.256 --> 12:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that what's happening here,
or are we seeing
a tinkering with tradition?

12:07.994 --> 12:10.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that's
absolutely
what's happening here, because
the way the

12:10.763 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senate works is by tradition.

12:13.032 --> 12:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are changing that
tradition to some
degree for Donald Trump.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Office of Government Ethics
says the big
problem here is that these are
nominees who

12:20.139 --> 12:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just didn't get their paperwork
as early as
in the past.

12:23.610 --> 12:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're complicated forms that
they have to
fill out, but the Trump
transition team was

12:27.480 --> 12:28.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aware of that.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we have on the Senate all
these hearings
this week.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By tradition, senators usually
have this information
in hand.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This time, they don't.

12:36.022 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is changing the way
Washington works
and scrutinizes our future
government.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Lisa
Desjardins, thank
you.

12:41.527 --> 12:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to be occupied with
this all
this week, into next week.

12:44.764 --> 12:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got, what, five separate
confirmation
hearings on Wednesday, several
every day this

12:50.536 --> 12:51.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Nine all week,
yes.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trying to follow
it all and
do the best job we can covering
it.

12:55.208 --> 12:59.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa, thank you.

12:59.178 --> 13:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Pleasure.

13:03.182 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A short time ago,
before the
Jared Kushner announcement, I
spoke with senior

13:12.125 --> 13:17.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway
about the concerns
surrounding some of these
Cabinet picks going

13:17.463 --> 13:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before the Senate this week.

13:19.499 --> 13:24.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started by asking why the
confirmation hearings
should go forward before the
Office of Government

13:24.203 --> 13:26.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ethics has fully vetted the
nominees.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: Judy,
as I understand it, some of the
materials

13:29.676 --> 13:32.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just aren't -- have not been
complete in the
process.

13:32.945 --> 13:38.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is no reason to
delay hearings
that we expect will cover the
substance of

13:38.451 --> 13:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the duties that each of those
men and women
would have in those respective
departments

13:41.888 --> 13:43.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and agencies.

13:43.723 --> 13:49.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In addition, it's my
understanding that some
of the designees have been
requested to turn

13:49.529 --> 13:54.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over tax information that has
not been part
of the regular course of action
in the past.

13:54.767 --> 13:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not sure where that
stands, but we
really need a fully functioning
government

13:59.105 --> 14:03.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
next week as we have the
transition of power
from President Obama to
President Trump.

14:03.476 --> 14:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that necessitates having, if
we can, secretary
of treasury and state and
defense and commerce

14:08.715 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and other agencies and
departments in place.

14:11.384 --> 14:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure that the senators can
ask these appointees
and designees under oath for
information about

14:17.223 --> 14:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the materials that haven't yet
been completed.

14:19.225 --> 14:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I assure you all of our
appointees and
designees have been complying
with all of

14:23.730 --> 14:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the requests and the ethical
obligations that
have been requested of them.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you
mentioned tax returns.

14:30.336 --> 14:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not all of them are required to
do that, but
by practice they are expected
to.

14:35.975 --> 14:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does the president-elect think
they should
comply with these rules, when he
himself has

14:41.114 --> 14:42.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not provided his own tax
returns?

14:42.915 --> 14:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, the
president-elect
and his senior team believes
that anything

14:47.787 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is required by law should
be handed over.

14:52.024 --> 14:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he knows that these men and
women who,
in some cases, are making
enormous sacrifices

14:57.230 --> 15:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to move to Washington, D.C.,
divest themselves
out of their significant
holdings and successful

15:01.601 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies to do so, are now
complying with
the ethics rules.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, anybody can ask a
question they
want to ask, Judy.

15:09.709 --> 15:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just hope that the questions
in the Senate
confirmation hearings are not
this big game

15:13.412 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of gotcha and hide the ball that
we sometimes
see, and this level of
obstructionism that

15:19.318 --> 15:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been promised by some of the
Democrats
in the Senate.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would be unfortunate
because we need
the government to continue to
function effectively.

15:26.659 --> 15:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure that your viewers know
President
Obama had seven Cabinet
appointees confirmed

15:33.332 --> 15:34.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Inauguration Day.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: We would like
the same courtesy
and the same practice.

15:37.837 --> 15:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I just would
interrupt
to say that a number of the
individuals that

15:41.107 --> 15:46.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president-elect has
nominated have very
complicated business, financial
backgrounds.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's taking time.

15:48.581 --> 15:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doesn't the public expect there
to be a full
vetting before they take office?

15:53.219 --> 15:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Yes, the
public probably
does expect that.

15:56.455 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the process
necessitates information
and disclosure, and under oath,
these men

16:03.629 --> 16:09.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and women will be asking
questions from these
Senate committees who are
overseeing the hearings.

16:09.068 --> 16:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's incredibly
important also,
because people should realize
that, in past

16:15.374 --> 16:20.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
confirmation hearings,
sometimes, people are
just asked to talk about how
they will deploy

16:20.880 --> 16:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different functions, what
decisions they made
in the past in hiring and
firing, and certainly

16:27.386 --> 16:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in their business practices.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And sometimes they're asked
about personal
financial information.

16:31.757 --> 16:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's just hope that it
advances the ball
forward for America in these
questions that

16:35.761 --> 16:39.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they're asking and have
something to do with
the proper functioning of the
government.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about several
other things.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned -- we were talking
about the
tax returns.

16:43.469 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are Mr. Trump's tax returns
still being audited
by the IRS?

16:47.340 --> 16:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will that continue once he takes
office as
president?

16:50.676 --> 16:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: This was
discussed last
week actually in my presence.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the fact is, the audit is
ongoing.

16:56.649 --> 17:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the answers are the same,
that as long
as there is an active audit, he
will not be

17:01.921 --> 17:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
turning over his tax returns.

17:03.289 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will he turn them
over once
that audit is complete?

17:07.226 --> 17:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, he said
that he would.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't know about the
specifics of the
audit.

17:10.897 --> 17:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, respectfully, this
was vetted
very often and talked about in
the media constantly

17:17.870 --> 17:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a daily basis, and the
American electorate
decided they wanted Donald Trump
to be their

17:21.941 --> 17:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president notwithstanding.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about the news
today, several news
organizations reporting

17:26.479 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president-elect's
son-in-law, Jared
Kushner, will come into the
White House as

17:30.716 --> 17:32.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a senior adviser.

17:32.585 --> 17:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What exactly will his role be,
and why is
there not a concern about
nepotism?

17:39.325 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, a few
things.

17:42.461 --> 17:46.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jared will make that
announcement formally
when he and the president-elect
are ready

17:46.165 --> 17:47.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sure hope the news reports are
true, Judy,
because it's an absolute
privilege and pleasure

17:51.671 --> 17:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to work with Jared Kushner on
the senior team,
and has been all along in the
transition and

17:56.275 --> 17:58.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

17:58.044 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jared Kushner offers a
tremendous business
acumen and experience as a very
successful

18:04.016 --> 18:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real estate developer and
businessman himself.

18:06.719 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has holdings in many of the
companies that
he has now promised to divest.

18:11.590 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will sell his share at fair
market value,
and significant holdings like
666 Fifth Avenue,

18:19.031 --> 18:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thrive Capital, and other
companies in which
he has a stake.

18:22.835 --> 18:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nepotism law doesn't -- the
anti-nepotism
law doesn't apply to White House
appointments.

18:28.808 --> 18:32.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president can appoint the
staff he wishes
to.

18:32.078 --> 18:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has had -- Jared has had
many lawyers
look at this, and they have
concluded, in

18:36.415 --> 18:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concert with the Office of
Government Ethics,
the OGE, that Jared is able to
have the special

18:42.755 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adviser appointment by the
president.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two quick
questions.

18:46.525 --> 18:50.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given, though, that he's the
president's son-in-law,
will he be first among equals
among the advisers

18:50.830 --> 18:52.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the White House?

18:52.732 --> 18:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, second of all, is Ivanka
Trump, his daughter,
coming into the administration
in any...

18:57.470 --> 18:58.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:58.471 --> 19:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Excuse me,
Judy.

19:00.706 --> 19:05.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jared Kushner has the trust and
the ear of
his father-in-law, and that's
most important

19:05.311 --> 19:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in working in the West Wing in
that capacity.

19:08.047 --> 19:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has this combination of
political instincts
and business acumen that's truly
exceptional.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's involved in many of the
decision-making
processes.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That will continue in the White
House.

19:19.058 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jared's always been a
fabulous team player
on our senior team.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really respects the advice
and counsel
of all of us.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're also all very candid
with each other.

19:29.068 --> 19:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we really try to play to
everybody's best
and highest use.

19:32.071 --> 19:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ivanka Trump will make that
decision and that
announcement, I'm sure, in the
coming days

19:36.809 --> 19:38.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or coming weeks.

19:38.778 --> 19:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she, too, has significant
success in the
private sector, certainly as an
executive

19:44.417 --> 19:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Trump Corporation, but
also with her
own brand, which is quite
successful.

19:49.789 --> 19:54.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She tells me hundreds of
millions of dollars
in sales this year, the Ivanka
Trump...

19:54.126 --> 19:55.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:55.127 --> 19:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

19:56.662 --> 19:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sounds like you're saying she
is coming
in to the administration?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, that
would be the
intent.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That certainly would be
wonderful news to
me.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe that that is the
intention and
the goal.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Ivanka Trump also will make
that decision
and that announcement on her own
terms.

20:10.676 --> 20:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She, too, is working with ethics
and compliance
experts and lawyers to make sure
everything

20:16.916 --> 20:20.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is as it should be before those
announcements
are made and those jobs are
taken.

20:20.886 --> 20:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kellyanne Conway,
thank you
very much for talking with us.

20:25.724 --> 20:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the upcoming Cabinet
confirmation
hearings, the latest on the
president-elect's

20:30.429 --> 20:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transition to the White House,
and more, it's
time for Politics Monday with
Tamara Keith

20:36.202 --> 20:40.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of NPR and Susan Page,
Washington bureau chief
for USA Today.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, welcome to both of
you.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Tam, we just heard from
Kellyanne Conway.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you expect from these
confirmation
hearings?

20:47.246 --> 20:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: They
certainly will be interesting,
but they will

20:50.783 --> 20:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all be happening at the same
time, so we will
have to have split-screens to
pay attention

20:55.988 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to everything.

20:57.790 --> 21:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And add on that screen Donald
Trump having
a press conference on Wednesday
on the same

21:02.328 --> 21:04.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day that there are five
confirmation hearings.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to be information
overload.

21:07.900 --> 21:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats will try to put up a
fight, to draw
out contrasts with Donald Trump
potentially

21:14.340 --> 21:19.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between his Cabinet picks and
the president-elect.

21:19.578 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will try to make it as
painful as
possible, but there isn't much
the Democrats

21:24.517 --> 21:26.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can actually do.

21:26.385 --> 21:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, do you
expect this ethic
-- the lack of ethics review to
be done for

21:30.489 --> 21:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of these nominees to
continue to be an
issue?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Well, I think the Democrats will
try to make

21:34.426 --> 21:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it an issue, but it's not
stopping the hearings.

21:36.562 --> 21:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Mitch McConnell on Sunday
on "Face the
Nation" did say that they
wouldn't hold votes

21:41.367 --> 21:44.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the floor until the ethics
paperwork was
done.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So there is at least that.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is not a law that says
they have to
wait, but it's certainly been
the practice

21:48.140 --> 21:49.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the past not to confirm
somebody.

21:49.942 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that the review
won't have been
done before the hearings for
some of these

21:53.946 --> 21:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates is a serious one for
Democrats,
because there are questions they
won't be

21:57.483 --> 21:59.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
able to ask.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are things they don't know
that they
may find out through these
ethics reviews.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's one reason Democrats
are concerned
about this issue.

22:03.789 --> 22:08.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tam, are
Democrats targeting
in particular some of the
nominees over others

22:08.527 --> 22:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or how are they looking at this?

22:10.629 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, that's the
challenge that
they're facing is that they have
targeted

22:15.401 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eight nominees.

22:17.303 --> 22:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, eight is a very big
number, and so they
aren't -- it's sort of a
scattershot approach.

22:24.443 --> 22:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There isn't like one nominee
that they are
just going to take down, in part
because they

22:28.214 --> 22:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have the votes to truly
block anyone
unless they get Republican help.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the moment, it doesn't
look like they
have it.

22:36.488 --> 22:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, something could change.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A hearing could go poorly.

22:40.226 --> 22:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the moment, by the
numbers, Democrats
aren't in a strong position.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't have much leverage.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, what is
your reporting
telling you about who is going
to get the

22:50.536 --> 22:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most attention from Democrats,
or are they
just spreading it out equally
among all of

22:54.206 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, I think there
are some cases
where there will be proxy
fights.

22:57.643 --> 23:02.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Rex Tillerson is a
good example
of that.

23:02.147 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Democrats and even some
Republicans
don't have a chance to quiz
Donald Trump about

23:06.085 --> 23:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his policy toward Russia, but
they can ask
Rex Tillerson about it.

23:09.488 --> 23:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rex Tillerson himself, as
head of ExxonMobil,
had a lot of dealings with
Russia in general,

23:14.426 --> 23:15.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Vladimir Putin in
particular.

23:15.794 --> 23:18.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that will be a big
source of debate
there.

23:18.364 --> 23:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In some cases, I think they are
going to target
the person.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that may be the case
with Jeff Sessions,
who has the first hearing
tomorrow.

23:24.303 --> 23:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you would think they would
go easy on
a senator, because it's an old
boys club.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in this case, I think some
of the Democratic
senators have real concerns
about things he

23:32.745 --> 23:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has said in the past, especially
dealing with
race relations, with voting
rights and on

23:36.915 --> 23:38.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So in that case, it may be
taking a little
more personal turn.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tam, Susan just
mentioned what
Mitch McConnell, the Senate
majority leader,

23:43.289 --> 23:44.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
said over the weekend.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm trying to understand.

23:46.825 --> 23:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this really different from
what happened
eight years ago, when President
Obama's nominees

23:52.731 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were coming through, because he
made it sound
as if, oh, this is just the same
thing we

23:56.201 --> 23:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- same way we have always done
it here.

23:58.170 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, they have
typically tried
to defer to presidents, and they
have typically

24:04.476 --> 24:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to have a big group ready
to go when
the president takes the oath of
office.

24:10.215 --> 24:15.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, Donald Trump's
nominees, some of
them, at least four of them,
have not finished

24:15.554 --> 24:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- who have hearings scheduled
have not finished
the ethics process, and that is
out of the

24:20.526 --> 24:23.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordinary, as we heard in an
earlier segment.

24:23.295 --> 24:29.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The only precedent that
Republicans are pointing
to goes back to when George W.
Bush was first

24:29.668 --> 24:30.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coming into office.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have one example.

24:32.571 --> 24:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it is the best practice to
have the ethics
review done, and it is also a
practice that

24:37.843 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has largely happened in the
past.

24:39.778 --> 24:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, I want to
turn to something
that happened last night, the
Golden Globes

24:43.282 --> 24:44.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Awards.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We reported it earlier.

24:46.618 --> 24:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meryl Streep, getting an award,
uses her time
to take on Donald Trump, and she
pinned it

24:52.458 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what she described as his
mocking a reporter,
news reporter, with
disabilities, and we saw

24:59.098 --> 25:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump come back and tweet
about her today,
calling her overrated and saying
he didn't

25:04.370 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mock him.

25:05.637 --> 25:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something that it's
smart for him
to engage in?

25:09.274 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see this?

25:11.043 --> 25:15.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, it's
untraditional for a
president to take on Meryl
Streep when she

25:15.814 --> 25:20.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticizes him at the Golden
Globes, or Arnold
Schwarzenegger when he doesn't
get ratings

25:20.185 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as big as he did for that
reality show that
he took over.

25:24.323 --> 25:28.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, you know, most
political pundits
would say, but this is a big
mistake, it's

25:28.227 --> 25:29.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not presidential.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the other hand, it's pretty
authentic.

25:31.130 --> 25:38.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's what got -- it's the kind
of attitude
and the kind of swagger that got
Donald Trump

25:38.203 --> 25:40.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where he is today.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I guess we will have to see
if voters are
comfortable with this approach,
because, believe

25:43.742 --> 25:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, I think we're going to be
seeing tweets
like this for the next four
years.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we shall
see.

25:48.947 --> 25:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, I want to ask both of
you, we know,
tomorrow night, President Obama,
Tam, gives

25:52.885 --> 25:54.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his farewell address.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to be covering it
live here 9:00
Eastern.

25:56.688 --> 26:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have given some thought to
the farewell
of this president.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, and I have given some
thought to the
farewells of lots of presidents.

26:03.829 --> 26:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a long tradition going
back to George
Washington, who delivered the
first farewell

26:08.167 --> 26:09.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
address.

26:09.568 --> 26:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there tends to be a mix of
looking backward
and looking forward.

26:13.939 --> 26:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George Washington offered
warnings for people
to come.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So did Dwight Eisenhower.

26:20.546 --> 26:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, I imagine, and
based on what
his administration has said, is
likely to

26:24.817 --> 26:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fall into the category of people
who -- presidents
who talk about American values
and America's

26:29.121 --> 26:31.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
role in the world.

26:31.223 --> 26:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that we can --
you know, as
he did on the campaign trail,
talked about

26:34.660 --> 26:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- on the campaign trail for
Hillary Clinton,
talked about what he sees as
American values,

26:39.531 --> 26:42.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that might be the message that
he tries to
send with his farewell.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, what are
you looking
for tomorrow night?

26:44.470 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, the stakes
got much
higher when Hillary Clinton lost
the election,

26:48.407 --> 26:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we now have President
Obama trying
to make his case that he's done
a lot, and

26:52.578 --> 26:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's good, the country's in
better shape than
when he took over, and that is a
legacy worth

26:56.348 --> 27:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preserving, because Donald Trump
is going
to come in and try to dismantle
big parts

27:00.319 --> 27:01.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that legacy.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think the stakes get higher
for him.

27:03.555 --> 27:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also his party is a little
bit in the
wilderness, trying to figure out
where they

27:07.059 --> 27:08.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

27:08.660 --> 27:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what will the role of Barack
Obama be
for the Democratic Party going
forward?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That might be one thing to
listen for tomorrow
night.

27:13.699 --> 27:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I know a lot
of people
are asking that question,
especially since

27:16.535 --> 27:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's going to continue to live
in Washington,
D.C.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is not going to be able to
hide.

27:20.606 --> 27:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or I guess he will try to hide,
but we will
see.

27:24.443 --> 27:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan Page, Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

27:27.546 --> 27:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

27:33.485 --> 27:39.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

27:39.424 --> 27:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:43.262 --> 27:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
upended lives
of Iraqi children fleeing the
war in Mosul.

27:49.468 --> 27:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, we continue our
series on President
Obama's legacy.

27:54.606 --> 27:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has been making
the case during
the final days of his term to
preserve his

27:59.044 --> 28:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
signature domestic achievement.

28:01.246 --> 28:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes as congressional
Republicans have
already begun the process of
dismantling the

28:06.151 --> 28:07.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act.

28:07.452 --> 28:11.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 20 million Americans
gained coverage
through the law.

28:11.456 --> 28:16.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as special correspondent
Sarah Varney
reports, the nation remains
deeply divided

28:16.395 --> 28:20.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
over whether it is the
president's greatest
success or a massive failure.

28:20.632 --> 28:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
This is going to take a little
while.

28:25.237 --> 28:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: When President
Obama signed
his landmark health care bill in
March 2010,

28:30.609 --> 28:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he achieved what presidents and
members of
Congress had long tried and
failed to do.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We are done.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:38.116 --> 28:42.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Provide
near-universal health
insurance to Americans.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democrats were jubilant.

28:43.956 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those in Obama's inner circle,
like Bob Kocher,
one of the law's primary
architects, celebrated

28:48.894 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their victory at the White
House.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB KOCHER, Key Affordable Care
Act Architect:
It was a moment of total joy.

28:52.931 --> 28:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We felt like we'd accomplished
something hard
and amazing and important that
would go down

28:56.935 --> 29:01.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in history as being an important
step forward
in American health care.

29:01.073 --> 29:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president felt that way,
and I think
we all celebrated and felt like
the hardest

29:05.677 --> 29:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part was perhaps behind us.

29:07.679 --> 29:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Since Harry
Truman, every Democratic
president has dreamed about
universal coverage.

29:13.852 --> 29:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan Oberlander, a health
policy historian
at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel

29:18.290 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hill, says Obama succeeded in
winning over
health care interest groups that
had fought

29:23.061 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
previous reform attempts.

29:24.830 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bill became a flash
point for bigger
ideological battles.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN OBERLANDER, Professor
of Social Medicine,
Health Policy and Management,
University of

29:30.002 --> 29:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina: In key respects,
it was a
policy success, but it was also
always a political

29:34.172 --> 29:36.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
failure since 2010.

29:36.942 --> 29:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that political failure
reflects that partisan
polarization, which Democrats
and the Obama

29:41.780 --> 29:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration never figured out
a way to
overcome.

29:46.952 --> 29:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The bill passed
without a single
Republican vote and would face
unflagging

29:53.158 --> 29:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposition, explosive town hall
meetings

29:55.994 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: If you let the free
market system work,
everybody could have insurance.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Angry Tea Party
protests.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Obamacare has got to
go!

30:03.602 --> 30:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: What do we want?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PROTESTERS: Health care!

30:07.239 --> 30:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And a Supreme
Court decision
in 2012 that, despite upholding
most of the

30:11.476 --> 30:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, weakened one of its central
provisions
by making the Medicaid expansion
optional

30:16.782 --> 30:19.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for states.

30:19.151 --> 30:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Charles Grassley, a
Republican from
Iowa who was involved in the
initial bipartisan

30:23.889 --> 30:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussions, said his side
turned away after
Democrats, who themselves were
frustrated

30:29.094 --> 30:33.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the prolonged negotiations
and felt they
had a mandate, decided to move
forward alone.

30:33.865 --> 30:35.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa: It
was a take
it or leave it, and so,
basically, we were

30:37.769 --> 30:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pushed out of the negotiations.

30:39.604 --> 30:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, quite frankly, there was a
lot of institutional
knowledge among Republicans that
would've

30:45.544 --> 30:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably prevented a lot of bad
things that
happened going wrong.

30:50.749 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's a perfect example
of trying to
do something in a partisan way.

30:56.354 --> 31:00.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: The Obama
administration believed
the law would eventually become
popular as

31:01.026 --> 31:03.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more Americans felt its
benefits.

31:03.428 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But public opinion remained
divided.

31:08.300 --> 31:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans voted to repeal or
delay part
or all of it more than 60 times,
always facing

31:13.138 --> 31:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prospect of a certain veto
from President
Obama.

31:18.143 --> 31:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now president-elect Donald Trump
has vowed
to kill the law for good.

31:21.646 --> 31:26.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Repealing
Obamacare is one of the single
most important

31:26.184 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons we must win on November
8.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: A promise that
appealed to many
voters around the country.

31:31.656 --> 31:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in Mansfield, Ohio, once a
booming manufacturing
town, the Affordable Care Act
has brought

31:37.796 --> 31:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance coverage, new health
care jobs and
an influx of federal money.

31:42.234 --> 31:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All told, nearly one million
Ohioans are covered
under Obamacare.

31:46.638 --> 31:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But economic angst in Rust Belt
states like
this one handed the presidential
election

31:50.709 --> 31:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Donald Trump, giving him the
power to repeal
President Obama's signature
domestic policy.

31:56.014 --> 31:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARI WESTFIELD, Third Street
Family Health
Services: This area was, the
kids would get

31:58.517 --> 32:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
older, graduate, and then leave
and not come
back.

32:00.952 --> 32:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: What happens next
is up for
grabs.

32:03.889 --> 32:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kari Westfield helps sign
patients up for
Medicaid in this Ohio county
where Mr. Trump

32:08.860 --> 32:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
won nearly 70 percent of the
vote.

32:10.862 --> 32:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARI WESTFIELD: The most recent
was the GM
closing, and that was a huge,
huge hit to

32:16.568 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the economy.

32:18.370 --> 32:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: As manufacturing
plants here
have closed, nearly 30 percent
of residents

32:22.073 --> 32:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had to enroll in Medicaid,
which was
expanded in Ohio to include most
low-income

32:26.945 --> 32:29.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adults under the Affordable Care
Act.

32:29.714 --> 32:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the health law took
effect, the share
of uninsured patients at Third
Street Family

32:35.020 --> 32:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Health Services, where Westfield
works, fell
from 30 percent to 10 percent.

32:42.460 --> 32:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That includes Larry Avery, a
31-year-old basketball
coach who has been rushing to
get medical

32:47.799 --> 32:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and dental care before Mr. Trump
takes the
law away.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY AVERY, Patient: I just
thought it was
just a move that he was doing
just to make

32:53.738 --> 32:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it harder than what it already
is, because,
I mean, if it's working, if it
helps, why

32:59.544 --> 33:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would you want to take that
away?

33:00.912 --> 33:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think it benefits the
country at all.

33:04.716 --> 33:08.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Among those trying
to enroll
in Obamacare's expanded Medicaid
are Trump

33:08.954 --> 33:10.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supporters Mary and Jim Heenan.

33:10.956 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A nurse trying to recover from
an opioid addiction,
Mary Heenan says she and her
husband need

33:16.261 --> 33:17.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help.

33:18.029 --> 33:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And though she says it can be
difficult to
reconcile, Heenan still despises
the health

33:22.067 --> 33:23.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says it forced the surgeons
she once worked
with to provide shoddy medical
care.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY HEENAN, Patient: I know I'm
in this spot
where I need help right now from
the government,

33:31.243 --> 33:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the Affordable Care Act is
the worst thing
that's ever happened to this
country.

33:38.516 --> 33:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's exactly why I voted
for Trump,
because I knew Hillary was going
to follow

33:43.788 --> 33:45.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Obama's footsteps.

33:45.624 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But John Corlett,
at the Center
for Community Solutions, an Ohio
think tank,

33:50.262 --> 33:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says other voters didn't take
Mr. Trump's
promise to repeal the law
seriously.

33:54.232 --> 33:57.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CORLETT, Center for
Community Solutions:
I think people have a natural
inclination

33:57.402 --> 34:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to think that, once something
starts, that
it's hard to stop,that it's hard
to take down.

34:01.606 --> 34:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of people sort
of approached
it that way, said, well, no,
they wouldn't

34:04.910 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

34:06.678 --> 34:09.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Across Ohio, the
health law
has dramatically reduced the
number of people

34:09.447 --> 34:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without health insurance.

34:11.549 --> 34:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At MetroHealth in Cleveland as
elsewhere in
the country, the influx of
insured patients

34:16.621 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has allowed the health system to
provide more
preventive care and cut costs by
nearly 30

34:21.993 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

34:23.862 --> 34:27.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite strong opinions about
what's become
known as Obamacare, elements of
the law remain

34:28.033 --> 34:29.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
widely popular.

34:29.801 --> 34:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health plans can't refuse to
insure based
on preexisting conditions, and
young adults

34:34.272 --> 34:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can stay on their parents' plans
until age
26.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTESTERS: No repeal without
replace.

34:39.277 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Mindy Hedges
showed up at a
rally outside Senator Rob
Portman's office

34:43.982 --> 34:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Columbus to show how vital
the law has
been for those with medical
problems.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MINDY HEDGES, Ohio: I'm scared
for our country.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm scared for a lot of reasons.

34:52.857 --> 34:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Before the health
law, she couldn't
get insurance.

34:55.627 --> 34:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MINDY HEDGES: I was so grateful
to President
Obama.

34:59.864 --> 35:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I owe President Obama my life.

35:03.535 --> 35:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a type 1 diabetic, I'm
uninsurable as far
as the insurance companies are
concerned.

35:08.173 --> 35:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now they couldn't take that
into any consideration.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my age, they couldn't take
into consideration.

35:14.179 --> 35:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Hedges has been
calling her
congressman and senators every
day to make

35:18.316 --> 35:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sure they hear her story.

35:20.051 --> 35:25.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MINDY HEDGES: Will he be
supporting keeping
it at least until we have
something better

35:25.991 --> 35:29.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or at least something to
substitute for it?

35:29.594 --> 35:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But there are
others, especially
small business owners and the
self-employed,

35:35.500 --> 35:38.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are frustrated by what's
been happening
in the insurance marketplaces.

35:38.570 --> 35:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIETRA HAMPER, Ohio: There do
not seem to
be a lot of options this year.

35:43.675 --> 35:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Anietra Hamper is
a travel writer
who started her own business a
few years ago,

35:48.747 --> 35:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and says the law made a mess of
her coverage.

35:51.282 --> 35:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIETRA HAMPER: Every year,
there have been
fewer providers.

35:55.053 --> 36:00.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's fewer plans by the
providers that
are left, higher monthly
premiums, deductibles

36:00.959 --> 36:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have skyrocketed, and the
benefits have dwindled.

36:04.029 --> 36:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Those frustrations
drove Hamper
to vote for Mr. Trump, who says
he wants to

36:08.867 --> 36:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep the law's more popular
provisions and
scrap the rest in favor of a
less regulated

36:14.205 --> 36:16.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insurance market.

36:16.141 --> 36:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But health care experts say it
will be impossible
to pay for those benefits
without a mandate

36:20.178 --> 36:22.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that all Americans have
coverage.

36:22.614 --> 36:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Repealing it with no plan in
place, they say,
will create chaos in the
insurance market

36:26.818 --> 36:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and catastrophe at hospitals and
clinics.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Hamper says the law has
already done enough
damage.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANIETRA HAMPER: This isn't
working.

36:35.093 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if Donald Trump says he
wants to reinstate
a free marketplace, where we
have more choices,

36:43.835 --> 36:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more competition, better care,
more affordability,
OK.

36:49.841 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like every other American,
you know, we
have to hope that that's what we
get.

36:54.846 --> 36:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Senator Grassley
says it's too
soon to lay out what comes next.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

37:00.618 --> 37:04.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: Obviously,
repeal is very
much what's going to happen.

37:04.556 --> 37:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it's a transition period
that it takes
a period of time to get total
replacement,

37:11.329 --> 37:16.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or whether it's done
incrementally, those
decisions have not been made at
this point.

37:16.568 --> 37:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Whatever the
outcome, many observers
say President Obama's legacy
will forever

37:21.673 --> 37:26.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
include his ambitious attempt to
solve one
of the nation's most intractable
problems.

37:26.344 --> 37:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB KOCHER: I think, forever, we
have changed
the conversation that we need to
have an approach

37:30.949 --> 37:32.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to cover all Americans.

37:32.817 --> 37:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if nothing else, this law
now leads Republicans
to agree that we need to have an
approach

37:38.523 --> 37:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to cover all Americans with
high-quality insurance.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think that's a real
accomplishment, and
that wouldn't have happened
without this law.

37:44.129 --> 37:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN OBERLANDER: Some of the
most gifted
presidents in the 20th century
tried comprehensive

37:49.434 --> 37:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care reform, and they
failed.

37:51.402 --> 37:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Obama succeeded.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not a footnote in
history.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will go down as a landmark.

37:58.009 --> 38:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And one of the
most important
legacies of the Obama years.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney.

38:06.651 --> 38:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, we
continue our series
on the Obama years with a look
at the president's

38:11.789 --> 38:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts to reform the nation's
criminal justice
system.

38:26.471 --> 38:31.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi government forces are
today engaged
in heavy fighting against ISIS
militants in

38:31.376 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city of Mosul, battling
neighborhood by
neighborhood.

38:35.413 --> 38:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the operation began last
October, almost
130,000 of the city's
million-plus residents

38:41.853 --> 38:43.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have fled.

38:43.588 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many are living in nearby camps
for internally
displaced people in Iraqi
Kurdistan.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Half of them are children.

38:51.362 --> 38:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For two-and-a-half years, all
they have known
is ISIS.

38:55.166 --> 39:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they and their families are
stranded,
waiting out a long, cold winter.

From Northern Iraq, special
correspondent
Marcia Biggs and videographer
Eric O'Connor

39:05.677 --> 39:06.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report.

39:06.678 --> 39:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It's a scene of
utter chaos.

39:12.116 --> 39:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News of food arriving sends
these civilians
displaced by the battle for
Mosul into a frenzy,

39:18.156 --> 39:23.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
charging this truck, as
desperate hands reach
out to catch bread and water,
talk to a mob

39:23.428 --> 39:25.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of hungry people.

39:25.430 --> 39:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The camps were supposed to be
temporary solution,
yet families here are facing
what now promises

39:30.969 --> 39:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be a very long winter.

39:33.438 --> 39:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's painfully cold, down to
freezing temperatures
at night.

39:36.841 --> 39:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Toxic fumes from the gas stoves
and heaters
permeate the tents.

39:42.313 --> 39:47.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, in this corner of the camp,
we found
a reason to smile.

39:47.385 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are sounds most of these
children have
not made in almost
two-and-a-half years.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every day, the children clamor
at the gates
of this child-friendly space.

39:57.562 --> 40:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get a precious six hours a
week here
to play, sing and learn, a far
cry from the

40:04.702 --> 40:06.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
horrors of ISIS.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We sat down with a few students
in the drawing
tent.

40:10.008 --> 40:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like most children, 13-year-old
Zuha stopped
going to school when ISIS came
to Mosul and

40:15.280 --> 40:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missed out on things like
drawing.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now she draws her memories of
home.

40:19.717 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ZUHA, Student (through
translator): We had
a garden, so I draw flowers.

40:23.421 --> 40:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Twelve-year-old
Bishara did
stay in school under ISIS, which
used militarization

40:28.493 --> 40:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and indoctrination as part of
its lesson plan.

40:32.330 --> 40:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In these pages of a math book,
children are
asked to solve problems about
setting land

40:36.934 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mines and killing nonbelievers.

40:38.970 --> 40:42.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BISHARA, Student (through
translator): After
ISIS came, I stayed in school
one-and-a-half

40:42.807 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything changed.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In math, the curriculum changed.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thy used bullets.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, one bullet plus two
bullets equals three
bullets.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Was that scary?

40:53.418 --> 40:55.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BISHARA (through translator):
Yes, it was
so scary.

40:55.353 --> 40:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: She finally asked
her parents
to remove her from school, but
she still has

40:59.924 --> 41:01.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big dreams.

41:01.225 --> 41:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked her what she wants to be
when she
grows up.

41:05.563 --> 41:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You want to be a doctor?

41:08.833 --> 41:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like many of the children, she's
drawing an
Iraqi flag.

41:11.402 --> 41:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says, "I love Iraq," words
forbidden under
the Islamic State, where the
Iraqi flag was

41:17.675 --> 41:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
banned and members of the Iraqi
army executed.

41:21.112 --> 41:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twelve-year-old Mohamed wants to
be an artist
someday and is proud of his
flag.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had two uncles in the Iraqi
police force.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED, Student (through
translator): They
killed two of my uncles they
worked for the

41:30.688 --> 41:32.123 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
police.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS killed anyone from the
police.

41:34.258 --> 41:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Did you spend a
lot of time
with your uncles?

41:36.928 --> 41:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were you really close with them?

41:38.129 --> 41:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED (through translator):
Yes.

41:39.530 --> 41:40.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They loved me.

41:40.698 --> 41:42.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They used to bring me toys.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My father and I used to play
hide and seek
with them.

41:45.403 --> 41:48.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Were you get
scared that maybe
your father might be hurt too?

41:48.506 --> 41:49.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED (through translator):
Yes.

41:49.574 --> 41:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am worried about my father and
brothers.

41:53.411 --> 41:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost all of my uncles were
police, so my
father was afraid.

41:56.381 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It's a familiar
fear.

41:59.283 --> 42:04.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we spoke, 12-year-old Mahmoud
was clearly
distressed, but wanted very much
to talk.

42:04.856 --> 42:09.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHMOUD, Student (through
translator): ISIS
was in Mosul for about
two-and-a-half years.

42:09.060 --> 42:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they came to the city, we
thought they
were good and they wouldn't hurt
us.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they began to kill and
torture people.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why we hated them.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Anyone you know
was hurt?

42:19.704 --> 42:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHMOUD (through translator): I
didn't see,
and I don't want to see.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was horrible and scary.

42:25.176 --> 42:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: He says he loved
math and reading
before ISIS came, and still
wants to be an

42:30.515 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
engineer.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHMOUD (through translator):
I'm comfortable
now that I am back to learning
and studying.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can study now, which is good.

42:36.988 --> 42:37.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm relieved.

42:37.989 --> 42:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you feel safe
here?

42:40.358 --> 42:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAHMOUD (through translator):
Yes.

42:41.826 --> 42:43.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here, I feel safe.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are people protecting us,
guarding us.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we still live in a tent, and
it rains
a lot.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really affecting us.

42:51.068 --> 42:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: He echoes a fear
we heard again
and again from the mothers in
the camp, the

42:56.407 --> 43:03.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terror of ISIS replaced by an
unknown future
in a tent at the beginning of a
cold, wet

43:03.047 --> 43:04.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winter.

43:04.682 --> 43:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-old-year-old Hijran
Tantafati (ph)
was an officer in the Iraqi
police.

43:07.852 --> 43:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When ISIS took Mosul, seven men
came to their
door for him.

43:11.389 --> 43:16.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HIJRAN, Iraq (through
translator): They executed
my husband because he was a
policeman working

43:16.727 --> 43:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Iraqi government.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he wouldn't give up his
weapons and surrender.

43:20.965 --> 43:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They killed all the policemen
because they
said they were nonbelievers.

43:25.736 --> 43:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They finally gave us the body a
month after
he died, but they wouldn't allow
us to have

43:30.374 --> 43:32.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a proper funeral.

43:32.276 --> 43:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Suddenly, a widow
with two children,
no money, and no job, she was
devastated,

43:37.715 --> 43:39.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but too afraid to speak out.

43:39.684 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If she ventured outside the
house without
strict Islamic clothing, ISIS
would torture

43:43.754 --> 43:46.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her male relatives.

43:46.257 --> 43:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hijran and her children are here
with her
older sister, Hiba, and her
family.

43:50.361 --> 43:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They fled Mosul after Iraqi
forces backed
by coalition airstrikes pushed
ISIS from their

43:55.533 --> 43:57.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhood.

43:57.368 --> 44:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They still have two sisters and
three brothers
in Mosul, so they have covered
their faces

44:00.838 --> 44:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to protect them from retribution
-- public
torture and execution made
routine under ISIS.

44:07.111 --> 44:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did you explain this to your
children?

44:09.547 --> 44:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did you try to protect them
from this?

44:11.649 --> 44:14.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIBA, Iraq (through translator):
I didn't
let them do anything.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I even banned them from going to
school.

44:16.521 --> 44:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't let them go outside.

44:18.923 --> 44:23.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would see torturing in the
market, cutting
off hands, cutting off a head.

44:23.728 --> 44:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They used a lot of torture.

44:25.596 --> 44:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, thank God, I didn't let the
children
see any of it.

44:29.367 --> 44:34.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Hiba became
pregnant last year
and entered a deep depression.

44:34.205 --> 44:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She gave birth to baby Karam at
home just
over a month before we met, with
her husband

44:38.709 --> 44:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sister by her side, as
coalition airstrikes
thundered down.

44:43.047 --> 44:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIBA (through translator): It
was the hardest
day in my life.

44:45.950 --> 44:48.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was so scared and confused.

44:48.386 --> 44:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But God made it easy for me, and
I gave birth.

44:51.289 --> 44:53.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The houses were being bombed,
and I was so
scared.

44:53.291 --> 44:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Are you afraid of
the life that
he's been brought into?

44:57.094 --> 45:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HIBA (through translator): I'm
worried about
the weather and the cold
temperatures here.

45:00.698 --> 45:04.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course I'm afraid for him,
for so many
reasons.

45:04.235 --> 45:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Aid organizations
expected more
people at camps like these, but
for a much

45:08.940 --> 45:10.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shorter time.

45:10.708 --> 45:14.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As the battle for Mosul
continues to grind
on with no end in sight, those
fleeing the

45:14.612 --> 45:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
battle continue to arrive in
droves, and it
doesn't look like they are going
anywhere

45:19.116 --> 45:20.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anytime soon.

45:20.918 --> 45:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maulid Warfa heads operations at
UNICEF in
Irbil, which runs the
child-friendly space.

45:25.923 --> 45:30.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says his main concern is the
duration of
the battle and the fact that the
camps were

45:30.127 --> 45:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
set up as emergency measures,
without proper
schools in the plans.

45:34.298 --> 45:39.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAULID WARFA, UNICEF: What
worries me the
most is to have these children
roaming around

45:39.270 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with no proper schooling, with
no proper protection,
losing their future.

45:45.109 --> 45:46.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Imagine if these were your
children.

45:46.677 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you want your children
to be?

45:48.579 --> 45:52.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want them to be going to
school, you want
them to be children again, you
want them to

45:52.249 --> 45:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be protected, you want them to
be loved, you
want them to be growing up as
very peaceful

45:58.356 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human beings.

46:00.091 --> 46:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The longer the war
grinds on,
the longer these families remain
trapped in

46:05.496 --> 46:10.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what human rights organizations
are calling
de facto detention centers.

46:10.534 --> 46:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we drove up to the camps, we
noticed parking
lots filled with the cars of
those who drove

46:15.039 --> 46:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there when fighting again, but
are now forbidden
to leave.

46:19.343 --> 46:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brigadier General Halkwat Rafaat
says they
could be a security threat.

46:22.713 --> 46:23.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
BRIG.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

46:25.249 --> 46:26.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HALKWAT RAFAAT, Iraq (through
translator):
Leaving the camp is forbidden.

46:26.350 --> 46:27.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can't leave the camp until
Mosul is liberated.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We keep their I.D.s with us.

46:28.753 --> 46:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will get their I.D.s when
they go back
to their homes.

46:31.255 --> 46:32.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, there's
nowhere to go?

46:32.590 --> 46:35.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can't go home until they're
told that
they can go home?

46:35.559 --> 46:36.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
BRIG.

46:36.560 --> 46:37.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HALKWAT RAFAAT (through
translator): No, they
can't leave.

46:39.397 --> 46:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: I asked the
sisters, which was
worse, life here or under ISIS?

46:42.700 --> 46:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIJRAN (through translator): Of
course life
here is better than ISIS.

46:46.470 --> 46:47.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS terrified people.

46:47.938 --> 46:50.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They made us afraid of
everything.

46:50.541 --> 46:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are trapped here, and
it's like we
traded one jail for another one.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We simply want to leave and live
our lives.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know nothing about our
families in Mosul.

47:01.519 --> 47:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know what is happening
there.

47:03.287 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And still they
come, despite
the harsh conditions.

47:07.358 --> 47:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were there when 6-year-old
Dema arrived
from Mosul with her family off,
not even yet

47:11.929 --> 47:13.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off the bus.

47:13.764 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"I want to say hi to my
grandparents in Kirkuk
and my grandparents in Irbil,"
she told me,

47:19.203 --> 47:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then was overcome with
emotions.

47:21.972 --> 47:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may be less than 100 miles
away, but
little does she know she likely
has no chance

47:27.945 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of seeing them or of leaving
this camp anytime
soon.

47:33.617 --> 47:38.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like most of the resilient
children we met,
she was all smiles when we saw
her again.

47:38.456 --> 47:39.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you happy here?

47:39.657 --> 47:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEMA, 6 Years Old (through
translator): Yes.

47:41.659 --> 47:42.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Why?

47:42.827 --> 47:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEMA (through translator): There
is no bombing
here.

47:44.829 --> 47:47.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, what do you
want to do now?

47:47.998 --> 47:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEMA (through translator): I
want to play.

47:48.999 --> 47:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It was a universal
desire.

47:50.801 --> 47:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we left, in their tattered
clothes, most
without proper shoes, the
children wanted

47:56.741 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing more than to go with us.

47:58.843 --> 48:03.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was everything we could
do to drive
away.

48:03.214 --> 48:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Hassan Sham camp east of Mosul,
Northern Iraq.

48:15.192 --> 48:27.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
to our "NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

48:27.204 --> 48:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be of interest to you,
too.

48:29.173 --> 48:35.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization Back on My Feet
uses running
as a catalyst to combat
homelessness.

48:35.045 --> 48:40.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group operates in 12 cities
across the
nation, including Boston, where
Cristina Quinn

48:40.584 --> 48:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from PBS station WGBH paid them
a visit.

48:44.188 --> 48:46.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: It's 5:30 a.m.

48:46.423 --> 48:48.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's dark and it's cold.

48:48.125 --> 48:52.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But none of that has discouraged
this group
from meeting up for their
morning run.

48:52.797 --> 48:56.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Team Hope.

48:56.567 --> 49:00.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They meet up every three times a
week outside
of the Hope House Rehab Center
in Roxbury.

49:01.005 --> 49:04.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group is made up of guys
from various
homeless shelters and recovery
programs around

49:04.909 --> 49:06.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Boston.

49:06.277 --> 49:12.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The whole idea is that these
morning runs
will change their lives.

49:12.149 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the core mission of the
organization
Back on My Feet, using running
as a catalyst

49:16.220 --> 49:19.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to move people out of
homelessness and into
jobs.

49:19.190 --> 49:23.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as executive director,
Theresa Lynn,
puts it, showing up for these
runs is just

49:23.661 --> 49:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the beginning of charting a new
course.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THERESA LYNN, Executive
Director, Back on
My Feet: The first step
obviously is running

49:27.765 --> 49:30.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or walking with a team three
days a week.

49:30.734 --> 49:35.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do that for a month, then
you're eligible
for what we call the next steps,
which is

49:35.272 --> 49:37.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really where the program gets
started.

49:37.875 --> 49:43.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's employment training, access
to job resources,
access to housing resources,
more gear, more

49:43.647 --> 49:44.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
running clothes.

49:45.015 --> 49:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We co-create a plan with you.

49:47.017 --> 49:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: That includes
counseling,
updating skills, paying for exam
books and

49:50.721 --> 49:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certifications or finding an
apartment.

49:53.557 --> 49:57.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It worked for Curt Ronan, a
recovering addict
who still runs with Hope House
three days

49:57.494 --> 49:58.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a week.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says the program has been
transformative.

50:00.164 --> 50:05.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CURT RONAN, Team Leader, Back on
My Feet:
Running is part of my recovery,
and I want

50:05.302 --> 50:07.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to show that it does work.

50:07.071 --> 50:10.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: He's been clean
for three
years, and, in that time, has
run both the

50:10.541 --> 50:13.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boston Marathon and the New York
City Marathon.

50:13.611 --> 50:17.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stakes are even higher now
that he has
a baby on the way.

50:17.248 --> 50:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victor Rivera, just out of
prison, is hoping
the program can work the same
magic for him.

50:24.121 --> 50:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His teammates also say he's the
fastest runner.

50:26.390 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTOR RIVERA, Back on My Feet:
I look forward
to it every day we run, because
it's like

50:31.028 --> 50:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have stories that we that are
either similar
or things that we can actually
relate to,

50:36.934 --> 50:40.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that actually helps me stay
with the group.

50:40.905 --> 50:44.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: Rivera says the
combination
of community and routine are
keeping him focused

50:44.708 --> 50:46.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and on the right path.

50:46.510 --> 50:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now in a culinary arts
program and is
excited about the networking
opportunities

50:50.047 --> 50:51.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Back on My Feet provides.

50:51.649 --> 50:53.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You sound like you are
definitely on the right
track.

50:53.150 --> 50:54.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you feel like you are on the
right track?

50:54.618 --> 50:56.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICTOR RIVERA: For the most
part.

50:56.453 --> 50:58.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, some days are better
than others,
but, for the most part, I feel
like -- I feel

50:59.023 --> 51:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
real confident about myself.

51:01.358 --> 51:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRISTINA QUINN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Cristina Quinn in Boston.

51:06.163 --> 51:09.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Remember that,
Back on My Feet.

51:09.233 --> 51:14.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later tonight on PBS,
"Independent Lens" presents
a film about the challenges of
storing nuclear

51:14.838 --> 51:16.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
material.

51:16.674 --> 51:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Containment" looks at efforts
by governments
around the world to deal with
highly toxic

51:20.744 --> 51:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
substances that will still be
dangerous tens
of thousands of years from now.

51:28.285 --> 51:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NELSON, Scientist: Behind
me is basically
the legacy of the Cold War
between the Soviet

51:38.329 --> 51:47.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NELSON, Scientist: Behind
me is basically
the legacy of the Cold War
between the Soviet

51:47.304 --> 51:52.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Union and the free West.

51:52.609 --> 52:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We produced, I think, close to
30,000 weapons,
warheads.

52:04.321 --> 52:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's lots of plutonium
and other fissile
materials that are left over
from the production

52:10.394 --> 52:16.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those weapons.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Someone has to take care of it,
in some way
needs to isolate it.

52:20.004 --> 52:22.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what this facility is
for.

52:22.806 --> 52:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Containment," it
airs tonight
on most PBS stations.

52:27.244 --> 52:32.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: A poet
playfully explores the question
of what makes

52:32.282 --> 52:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the United States unique.

52:33.617 --> 52:39.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

conversation
with President Obama's chief of
staff, Denis

52:43.927 --> 52:44.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
McDonough.

52:44.928 --> 52:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:46.296 --> 52:48.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:48.098 --> 52:52.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening for special coverage of
President

52:52.136 --> 52:53.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama's farewell speech.

52:53.470 --> 52:59.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

52:59.710 --> 53:03.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
