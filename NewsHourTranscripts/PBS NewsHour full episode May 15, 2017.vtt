JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.366 --> 00:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
The Washington Post reports
President Trump revealed highly

00:11.166 --> 00:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classified material to Russia's
foreign minister and ambassador
during their visit to the Oval

00:17.100 --> 00:18.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Office.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then: a hack felt
around the world.

00:21.333 --> 00:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk to the president of
Microsoft about the cyber-attack
leaving hospitals and businesses

00:27.533 --> 00:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in 150 countries facing
ransom for their files.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our Politics Monday duo
explore what the fallout from
the firing of the FBI director

00:39.133 --> 00:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could mean for President
Trump's agenda going forward.

00:42.300 --> 00:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:49.166 --> 00:52.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word
tonight that President Trump may
have jeopardized a secret source

01:01.900 --> 01:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of intelligence on the
Islamic State group.

01:04.933 --> 01:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post is reporting
that the president divulged
highly sensitive information

01:11.900 --> 01:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he met with the Russian
foreign minister and Russian
ambassador last week.

01:14.866 --> 01:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The account says an ally
provided the intelligence,
but had not given
permission to share it with

01:20.366 --> 01:22.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

01:22.366 --> 01:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're joined now by Greg Jaffe,
one of the Washington Post
reporters who broke the story.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg Jaffe, tell us exactly
what happened, as you know it.

01:29.633 --> 01:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE, The Washington
Post: So, the meeting with the
Russian foreign minister and the

01:32.000 --> 01:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian ambassador
was taking place.

01:34.033 --> 01:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president was sharing
information with them with
regard to the laptop threat

01:38.766 --> 01:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that had been an issue -- the
concern -- the threat posed
by laptops -- the threat posed

01:46.066 --> 01:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by aviation to laptops,
which had been an issue.

01:48.333 --> 01:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was describing the nature
of that threat, was boasting
about the great intel he had

01:54.800 --> 01:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, in doing so, may have
overstepped the bounds.

01:57.433 --> 02:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is
information that had come from
a U.S. ally, is that correct?

02:01.966 --> 02:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG JAFFE: Yes,
that's exactly right.

02:03.900 --> 02:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's particularly sensitive,
and I think the ally which
controls the dissemination

02:10.933 --> 02:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the information would be
upset to have learned that it
landed in the Russians' hands.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It sounds as
if, from your reporting, Greg,
that the White House recognized

02:18.933 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty quickly what had
happened, because you wrote that
they contacted both the CIA

02:23.733 --> 02:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the National Security
Agency afterwards.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG JAFFE: Yes,
that's exactly right.

02:28.633 --> 02:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they -- you know, they
controlled dissemination
of the transcripts
immediately afterwards.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they struck the references
to a sort of memo summary that
went out in the White House

02:41.400 --> 02:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
describing the meeting to
ensure that the information
didn't get out any further than

02:45.500 --> 02:47.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it already had.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, the problem is not
internal to the U.S. government.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The problem is the
dissemination to the Russians.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is the
damage done here potentially?

02:53.866 --> 02:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: You know, I think
there are a couple of concerns.

02:56.966 --> 03:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you worry first and
foremost about potentially
compromising sources and methods

03:03.933 --> 03:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that allowed us -- that has
allowed us to gather this
intelligence over a period of

03:07.900 --> 03:09.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My understanding is that
this is sort of a stream of
intelligence that's been useful

03:12.633 --> 03:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over quite a period of
time, so I think that's the
first and foremost worry.

03:16.833 --> 03:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secondary worry is that
you compromise a relationship
with an important ally.

03:20.566 --> 03:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm going
to read back to you what
you quote in the story.

03:24.333 --> 03:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're quoting H.R.
McMaster, the president's
national security adviser.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said to you that at no time
were any intelligence sources or
methods discussed, and he said

03:36.366 --> 03:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no military operations were
not already disclosed that were
not already known publicly.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG JAFFE: Yes, I
think that's right.

03:42.033 --> 03:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the worry is, by giving
-- sharing this intelligence
with the Russians, that

03:48.000 --> 03:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it potentially compromises
sources and methods.

03:49.933 --> 03:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, this was
information that was shared
that the Russians weren't aware

03:53.133 --> 03:55.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't know how we had
access to it, so I think the
worry is that you -- that their

03:57.700 --> 04:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ability is to reverse-engineer,
to sort of figure out where
this information was coming

04:03.633 --> 04:05.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
from.

04:05.666 --> 04:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clearly, Greg
Jaffe, you're not going to tell
us your source on this story,

04:08.633 --> 04:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but is it fair to say the
White House didn't want
this information revealed?

04:12.166 --> 04:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: Yes, I think that's
very fair to say that the
White House is very concerned,

04:16.466 --> 04:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, both about the
information shared in the Oval
Office and about the story.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where
does this go from here?

04:22.600 --> 04:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the president has shared
this in a conversation
with the Russian foreign
minister, the Russian

04:27.033 --> 04:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ambassador to the U.S.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can one expect?

04:31.433 --> 04:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has there been an apology
made to the ally, the
country, the officials
from whom the information

04:37.133 --> 04:38.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
came?

04:38.566 --> 04:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: You know, I don't
know the answer to that.

04:41.066 --> 04:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think this is one
of those issues where it's so
unprecedented, that I'm not

04:45.433 --> 04:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sure where it goes from here.

04:47.400 --> 04:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been reporting on
national security matters for
quite a while, and it's hard to

04:52.766 --> 04:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recall something like this.

04:54.900 --> 04:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are presidents
given some sort of training or
guidance on how to talk about

05:00.900 --> 05:02.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intelligence?

05:02.866 --> 05:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: Well, you know,
they get talking points
prior to the meetings.

05:04.966 --> 05:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is where it's important
to have talking points and have
a staff prepare the president

05:07.833 --> 05:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and have the president
be willing to listen
and be prepared.

05:10.633 --> 05:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's the concern,
that this is a president who
doesn't have a long history

05:15.100 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in government, is a president
who relies on his gut and
likes to wing it in meetings.

05:21.566 --> 05:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
the concern here.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to be open to being
staffed, and I think that's
potentially what was worrisome

05:30.033 --> 05:32.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

05:32.033 --> 05:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Jaffe of
The Washington Post, one of
the reporters on the story that

05:35.033 --> 05:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has just broken within the
hour, Greg, we thank you.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG JAFFE: Yes,
thanks for having me.

05:39.566 --> 05:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the
day's other news: The president
said the White House is moving

05:44.300 --> 05:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rapidly to replace the man he
fired last week as director
of the FBI, James Comey.

05:50.766 --> 05:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least eight candidates were
interviewed over the weekend.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They included, among
others, acting FBI Director
Andrew McCabe, Republican
Senator John Cornyn

05:59.066 --> 06:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Texas and a former Republican
congressman, Mike Rogers.

06:03.133 --> 06:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the White House
press insisted today that the
president wants a full FBI

06:10.100 --> 06:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
review of Russian meddling
in the election, no
matter what it concludes.

06:12.133 --> 06:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: The actions that
he took, he knew could be

06:16.533 --> 06:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
detrimental to himself, but
none of those things mattered,
because the president had

06:21.100 --> 06:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do the right thing for the
American people because he
believes that Jim Comey was the

06:26.100 --> 06:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wrong man for that position.

06:28.066 --> 06:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
himself has called the
investigation a charade.

06:31.833 --> 06:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spicer also refused, again, to
confirm or deny that Mr. Trump
audiotaped his conversations

06:38.000 --> 06:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with James Comey or
with anyone else.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deputy Attorney General
Rod Rosenstein will brief
the full Senate on the
firing this Thursday.

06:47.766 --> 06:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Nations is nearly
doubling its appeal for
humanitarian aid in South Sudan,

06:53.100 --> 06:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
facing a brutal
civil war and famine.

06:55.766 --> 07:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The director of the World
Food Program warned today
that the suffering is --
quote -- "unimaginable."

07:02.000 --> 07:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.N. agencies said they need
at least $1.4 billion to
provide assistance to refugees.

07:07.833 --> 07:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States accused the
government of Syria today of
killing thousands of prisoners,

07:12.533 --> 07:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and burning the bodies
to hide the evidence.

07:15.233 --> 07:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A top State Department official
said mass executions are
taking place about 45 minutes

07:21.433 --> 07:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
outside Damascus at a
large prison facility.

07:23.966 --> 07:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART JONES, Acting
Assistant U.S. Secretary
for Near East Affairs:
The regime is responsible

07:25.533 --> 07:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for killing as many as 50
detainees per day at Sednaya.

07:32.566 --> 07:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Credible sources have believed
that many of the bodies have
been disposed in mass graves.

07:38.966 --> 07:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We now believe that
the Syrian regime has
installed a crematorium
in the Sednaya prison

07:44.466 --> 07:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complex, which could
dispose of detainees remains
with little evidence.

07:47.866 --> 07:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: State Department
officials also called for
Russia to use its influence

07:52.133 --> 07:55.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Damascus regime
to stop the atrocities.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court
will not hear an appeal to
reinstate North Carolina's
voter identification

08:02.866 --> 08:04.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

08:04.366 --> 08:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today's announcement leaves a
lower court ruling in place.

08:06.966 --> 08:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It found that the law
targeted African-Americans
with what it called --
quote -- "almost surgical

08:11.533 --> 08:13.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
precision."

08:13.600 --> 08:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The law imposed stricter I.D.
requirements, rolled back early
voting and eliminated same-day

08:19.200 --> 08:21.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
registration.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the second Monday in a row,
a federal appeals court has
heard arguments on President

08:25.933 --> 08:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's travel ban.

08:27.900 --> 08:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This time, a panel of the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals, in
Seattle, heard a challenge

08:31.533 --> 08:33.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the state of Hawaii.

08:33.566 --> 08:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judges pressed a top Justice
Department lawyer on whether the
ban on travel from six Muslim

08:39.900 --> 08:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nations is, indeed,
religious discrimination.

08:42.433 --> 08:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE MICHAEL HAWKINS,
Ninth Circuit of Appeals:
Has the president ever
disavowed his campaign

08:46.600 --> 08:48.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statements?

08:48.666 --> 08:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has he ever stood up and said,
I said before I wanted to ban
all members of the Islamic

08:54.500 --> 08:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faith from entering the United
States of America, I was wrong?

08:57.266 --> 09:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY WALL, Attorney:
Over time, the president
clarified that what he
was talking about were

09:02.033 --> 09:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic terrorist groups,
and the countries that
shelter or sponsor them.

09:06.466 --> 09:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, over time, he and his
advisers clarified that what he
was focused on were groups like

09:10.800 --> 09:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS and al-Qaida.

09:12.866 --> 09:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last
week, an appeals court
in Richmond, Virginia,
heard similar arguments

09:16.666 --> 09:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in another suit
against the travel ban.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Trump Cabinet
is now complete.

09:21.866 --> 09:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Robert Lighthizer was
sworn in today as U.S.
trade representative.

09:26.033 --> 09:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vice President Mike Pence
presided over the ceremony.

09:29.133 --> 09:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lighthizer is the last
Cabinet official to be
confirmed by the Senate.

09:33.133 --> 09:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's expected to play a key role
in renegotiating trade deals.

09:37.866 --> 09:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
rose, as oil prices surged.

09:42.566 --> 09:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 85 points
to close near 20982.

09:48.733 --> 09:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose 28, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 11.

09:51.666 --> 09:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the president of Microsoft on a
global cyber-attack; heightened

09:58.633 --> 10:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
threats from North
Korea's latest missile
launch; new limits by
the Trump administration

10:04.866 --> 10:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on foreign aid to groups
that provide abortion
services; and much more.

10:16.233 --> 10:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The worldwide cyber-attack
appeared to slow today.

10:23.800 --> 10:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since Friday, the so-called
ransomware has hit more than
200,000 victims in more than

10:29.566 --> 10:31.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
150 countries.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The worst of it
today was in Asia.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

10:36.233 --> 10:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At a movie
theater in Seoul, South Korea,
screens flashed the bad news:

10:41.633 --> 10:44.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now playing, a
global cyber-attack.

10:44.400 --> 10:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Indonesia, the waiting room
at a cancer hospital in Jakarta
was packed with patients,

10:50.866 --> 10:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their records also held hostage
by this so-called ransomware.

10:53.666 --> 10:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There are always so many people.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why it's taking so long.

10:59.466 --> 11:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're tired, but we
need the treatment.

11:01.966 --> 11:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In
China, state media reported
some 4,000 schools were
among the hardest-hit

11:07.966 --> 11:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there, including two
prestigious universities.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WANG WENYI, Chinese
National Computer
Response Center (through
translator): If we pay the

11:12.866 --> 11:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ransom, then we are risking
getting our personal
information, including
our account information,

11:17.200 --> 11:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recorded and stolen.

11:19.666 --> 11:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Japanese
companies Hitachi and
Nissan were affected
as well, but Japan's

11:22.766 --> 11:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief cabinet secretary
said the damage was minimal.

11:25.666 --> 11:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The virus first struck on
Friday, primarily at hospitals
in Britain and companies across

11:31.300 --> 11:33.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

11:33.833 --> 11:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This particular kind of
ransomware takes advantage
of a security flaw in
Microsoft's Windows

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
operating system.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It locks users out of their
computers until they pay
a ransom to get it back.

11:42.700 --> 11:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This strain of ransomware was
apparently built in part using
software created by the National

11:47.233 --> 11:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Security Agency, the NSA, which
was then stolen by hackers.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Microsoft patched the flaw in
its system in March, but many
users either ignored it or

11:56.233 --> 11:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
refused to pay for it.

11:58.266 --> 12:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an open letter Sunday,
Microsoft President Brad Smith
blamed the NSA and called it yet

12:05.033 --> 12:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another example of
why the stockpiling
of vulnerabilities by
governments is such a problem.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir
Putin, who is visiting
China, also criticized
the U.S., amid reports

12:15.866 --> 12:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that his interior ministry
had been hit hard.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): The primary
source of the virus

12:20.000 --> 12:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happens to be the intelligence
services of the United States.

12:23.566 --> 12:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia here is
absolutely uninvolved.

12:26.133 --> 12:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But at
the White House today,
Tom Bossert, President
Trump's homeland security

12:29.400 --> 12:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adviser, said the NSA had
never intended its tool to
be used by foreign criminals.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM BOSSERT, White House
Homeland Security Adviser: This
was a vulnerability exploit

12:36.366 --> 12:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as one part of a much larger
tool that was put together by
the culpable parties and not

12:41.166 --> 12:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the U.S. government.

12:42.700 --> 12:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this wasn't a tool developed
by the NSA to hold ransom data.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
there's been political fallout.

12:49.933 --> 12:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Britain, where a general
election looms, opposition
leader Jeremy Corbyn and Prime

12:54.566 --> 12:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Minister Theresa May
traded jibes long-distance:

12:57.633 --> 13:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader,
Labor Party: Over the
past seven years, our
National Health Service

13:01.333 --> 13:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has been driven into
crisis after crisis.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Tory cuts have
exposed patient services
to cyber-attack.

13:08.366 --> 13:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: Cyber-security is an
issue that we need to address.

13:12.833 --> 13:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why the government, when
we came into government in 2010,
put money into cyber-security.

13:17.300 --> 13:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
cyber-attack's effects
in the United States
have been limited, except

13:21.366 --> 13:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for damage to the
FedEx delivery service.

13:23.833 --> 13:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

13:26.133 --> 13:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And let's turn
to Microsoft now, which has
been responding to this attack

13:30.400 --> 13:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and criticizing the NSA for its
alleged role in exploiting the
vulnerability to begin with.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brad Smith is the
president and chief legal
officer of the company.

13:40.733 --> 13:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He joins me from
Redmond, Washington.

13:43.566 --> 13:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brad Smith, welcome
back to the "NewsHour."

13:45.466 --> 13:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, first off, what is the
status of this cyber-attack?

13:48.366 --> 13:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were some reports late
today about a new variant
surfacing in parts of the world.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about that?

13:55.266 --> 13:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRAD SMITH, President,
Microsoft: Well, I
think, as the report
just showed, things seem

13:57.533 --> 14:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be calming down a bit,
but it's too early to declare
victory or say that this episode

14:02.166 --> 14:03.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is over.

14:03.666 --> 14:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As you just mentioned, new
variants can be created.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not uncommon in
these kinds of situations.

14:08.433 --> 14:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will have to monitor them.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, more broadly,
even as we help customers
who are dealing with
this particular attack,

14:15.800 --> 14:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a wakeup call for all
of us, whether we're in the
tech sector, customers or in

14:20.800 --> 14:22.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need to do more to
address this problem.

14:24.133 --> 14:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you did say
in the memo that you -- that
Microsoft issued yesterday,

14:28.633 --> 14:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you did say this is a powerful
reminder everybody needs to
keep their computers current and

14:32.800 --> 14:34.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
patched.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you did go on to point
that finger at governments
and what you call stockpiling

14:37.833 --> 14:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of vulnerabilities.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you mean by that?

14:40.900 --> 14:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, we have been
pointing out in recent months
that, more and more, in multiple

14:45.066 --> 14:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries, certain agencies and
some governments are stockpiling
vulnerabilities, meaning the

14:51.900 --> 14:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flaws That they find in
software, they're creating
their own exploits, so that they

14:56.400 --> 14:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have them available.

14:57.933 --> 14:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this causes us concern.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We believe the world needs
some new rules to govern this.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need governments to act with
restraint, and we certainly
need governments that are

15:06.800 --> 15:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creating these kind
of cyber-weapons to
be effective, so that
they're not stolen or get

15:12.766 --> 15:14.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leaked out.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I want
to ask you about that, because,
at the White House today,

15:17.166 --> 15:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's homeland
security adviser, Tom Bossert
-- I think you just heard him

15:21.400 --> 15:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say this -- he said the NSA
never intended for this tool
that they created to be used

15:27.800 --> 15:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as part of some
ransomware attack.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: I think
that's got to be the case.

15:33.733 --> 15:38.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the reality is, this
was an unusual attack.

15:38.233 --> 15:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It involved the combination
of a very sophisticated
piece of software of
the type we sometimes

15:45.300 --> 15:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
see in governments, then
combined with a much
less sophisticated piece
of software, in effect,

15:51.266 --> 15:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the ransomware component.

15:53.233 --> 15:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in all probability, it's
some type of organized criminal
group that took what came

16:00.133 --> 16:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of the government and put
it to use in a way that no one
ever intended, but the damage

16:06.966 --> 16:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is still done, and we can't
assume that this is the last
time we will see this type of

16:10.600 --> 16:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
problem if we don't find
a way to take new steps.

16:14.333 --> 16:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Brad
Smith, what do you say about
Microsoft's role in this?

16:18.166 --> 16:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure you know there are
security analysts out there who
are saying, not only because

16:25.633 --> 16:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these flaws existed in
something that Microsoft,
that your company
created, but also that the

16:30.733 --> 16:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
company apparently hasn't done
enough to alert people that
these flaws are there, that they

16:36.666 --> 16:38.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
need to patch?

16:38.700 --> 16:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are some nonprofit
organizations, the
governments that we have
been discussing that

16:41.733 --> 16:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just haven't gotten
around to it.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these analysts are
saying, Microsoft should have
done more to alert people.

16:47.866 --> 16:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, the very
first thing that I said in my
statement yesterday was that

16:52.166 --> 16:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Microsoft, in fact, has
the first responsibility
to address these issues.

16:58.033 --> 16:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's unquestionable.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We look at everything
that we're doing today.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have 3,500
security engineers.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We worked over the
weekend to provide help to
customers around the world.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We acted in March
to patch software.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We acted in March to talk
about the importance of
this, as we do all the time.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is a wakeup call
for us, for customers.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of us should assume
that we're doing everything
that we can possibly do.

17:26.433 --> 17:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's all learn
from this together.

17:28.633 --> 17:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would be the first to
say that, just as government
needs to do more, we need to

17:32.733 --> 17:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ask ourselves what more
we could do as well.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can you
say at this point what
more Microsoft can do?

17:38.733 --> 17:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, one of the
issues that I think we need
to think through around the

17:42.766 --> 17:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world is how to help customers,
especially in sophisticated,
diversified, complicated

17:50.533 --> 17:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
information technology
environments to deploy
patches more easily.

17:56.966 --> 18:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The National Health Service
in the U.K. is a good example.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very large institution.

18:02.100 --> 18:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, in some cases, the
computers are a good deal older.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is certainly
an opportunity for us to ask
ourselves, what new technologies

18:14.233 --> 18:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can we deploy, what new
processes can we develop to
make it easier for customers?

18:18.766 --> 18:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, of course, we
do need customers to act.

18:21.233 --> 18:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We cannot actually patch
their systems unless they
deploy our technology.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that, too, is a
lesson for us all.

18:29.466 --> 18:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to go
back to what you were saying
about the role of governments

18:31.566 --> 18:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the role specifically in
this country of the National
Security Agency, the NSA.

18:35.933 --> 18:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Your point is that they
have developed devices
to fix these flaws that
exist, but they haven't

18:45.033 --> 18:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shared them quickly enough.

18:47.033 --> 18:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Were you notified, was
Microsoft notified by
NSA that this was coming?

18:51.133 --> 18:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD SMITH: Well, I don't
want to go into the specifics
of how we learned about this

18:55.666 --> 18:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
particular problem
or by whom or when.

18:58.600 --> 19:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is of public record that
we provided a patch in March.

19:03.166 --> 19:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There wasn't a public statement
about this until April.

19:07.300 --> 19:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I think is also
important is that we
need the global community
to come together.

19:14.233 --> 19:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We called earlier this year
for the creation, in effect,
of a digital Geneva Convention,

19:19.533 --> 19:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new rules of the road that apply
to everybody, because this is
an issue, in this instance,

19:25.933 --> 19:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that may have arisen in the
United States, but no one should
think that this is an issue

19:29.266 --> 19:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unique to the United States.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is an issue for many
governments around the world.

19:33.966 --> 19:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brad Smith,
the president of Microsoft, we
thank you very much for joining

19:39.433 --> 19:40.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

19:40.233 --> 19:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD SMITH: Thank you.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And some further
reporting now on this and
what consumers need to know.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that comes from
William Brangham.

19:49.266 --> 19:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, for
that, we turn to Eric Geller,
who covers cyber-security for

19:52.233 --> 19:53.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Politico.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

19:54.366 --> 19:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC GELLER,
Politico: Thank you.

19:56.466 --> 19:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, you just
heard the president of Microsoft
make his argument, that they're

19:58.633 --> 20:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not really to blame for
this, for the slowness
or relative slowness, of
putting out the patches.

20:03.866 --> 20:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of
that point he's making?

20:05.900 --> 20:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC GELLER: Well, Microsoft
is in a tricky position here,
because, as you heard, he didn't

20:08.366 --> 20:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to discuss whether they
had been informed by the NSA.

20:11.433 --> 20:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Seems likely they were informed.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only other possibility is
that they were told by this
group that leaked the files.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, either way, they're
in a tricky situation.

20:18.100 --> 20:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have got to rush
to fix this problem that
they didn't know about.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're wondering whether they
should demand some changes to
the way the government deals

20:24.333 --> 20:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these policies.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, at the same
time, they're wondering what
the consequences are going

20:28.033 --> 20:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be for consumers.

20:29.266 --> 20:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they are in a
tricky situation.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think they moved as
fast as they could.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, what we're seeing
is, the more time you have
to tell customers about the

20:35.566 --> 20:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem, the more
customers who will fix it.

20:37.766 --> 20:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They had only a very
short period of time.

20:39.766 --> 20:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And,
obviously, we have been talking
about this potential that the

20:42.800 --> 20:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - this was somehow a
tool created by the NSA
that was stolen by hackers.

20:49.766 --> 20:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Microsoft is arguing that
that's really the problem,
that the government is devising

20:52.900 --> 20:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tools to break
into our computers.

20:55.066 --> 20:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Inevitably, those tools
are going to get out,
and we're going to see
the havoc we have seen.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make
of that argument?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC GELLER: They certainly have
a point that the U.S. government
has not done a great job

21:03.966 --> 21:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of keeping its secrets secret
over the past few years,
Edward Snowden, Harold Martin,

21:08.233 --> 21:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was recently arrested
and charged with stealing
classified information.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Shadow Brokers, we still
don't know who they are.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, of course, WikiLeaks
has been posting CIA files.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, look, Microsoft has a point.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The government is not as
good as this as it should be.

21:20.266 --> 21:25.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the other hand, the
government needs to
be able to break into
Russian computers, ISIS

21:25.800 --> 21:27.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
computers.

21:27.866 --> 21:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are all kinds of valid
foreign intelligence targets out
there who are using Windows and

21:30.533 --> 21:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who need to be surveilled
by our government in
order to do its job.

21:33.333 --> 21:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think Microsoft is in a
tricky spot because it doesn't
want to say the government

21:37.033 --> 21:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shouldn't be able to
spy on terrorists, but
those same terrorists,
they use the products

21:41.166 --> 21:43.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we use.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so issues that allow
them to be spied on,
they also put us at risk.

21:45.466 --> 21:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously,
that seems like the trickiest
part of the debate.

21:48.433 --> 21:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the government can detect
that there is a hole in a
company's software, do they have

21:55.066 --> 21:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an obligation to tell
that company, so that
they can patch it?

21:57.533 --> 22:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then that also gives away
the tool that the government
no longer has to do this exact

22:02.033 --> 22:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
surveillance you're describing.

22:03.033 --> 22:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC GELLER: Yes.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the government
has a process.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should say, they have a
process for deciding when to
reveal a flaw to a company.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called the vulnerability
equities processes.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the government actually
revealed it a few years ago when
there was a major vulnerability

22:13.533 --> 22:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that was disclosed in public.

22:15.533 --> 22:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They still don't have all
the fine-tuning details
of that nailed down.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's been some efforts.

22:20.666 --> 22:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California Democrat Ted Lieu
yesterday said - - or, I should
say, Friday said that he wanted

22:24.200 --> 22:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to reform that process.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wanted to change the rules
for when the government has
to tell a company about this.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're in the very early
stages of this process.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very obscure issue.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not one that people are
familiar with, but it's one
that, I think, as we saw this

22:36.200 --> 22:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weekend, it's becoming more
important to our own lives.

22:38.766 --> 22:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Getting
back to this attack
itself, do you think, as
we have been reporting,

22:42.633 --> 22:46.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that this seems like
it's winding down, or,
as Judy mentioned, are
we see going to more

22:46.466 --> 22:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
variants crop up?

22:48.500 --> 22:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC GELLER: It's hard to say,
because, as you point out,
anybody can build a new variant,

22:51.733 --> 22:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anybody can change the code,
put it back out there, and
the ways of sort of killing it

22:55.866 --> 22:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and tamping down on it, they
have to be pursued freshly,
they have to be pursued anew.

22:59.866 --> 23:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so it's possible
that this never stops.

23:02.266 --> 23:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a hard time imagining
that cyber-criminals will
just keep doing this forever.

23:05.833 --> 23:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are going to find other
things that they like to do, but
there is certainly no technical

23:09.300 --> 23:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reason that it can't
happen forever.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We saw
this break out first in
hospitals in the U.K.

23:15.533 --> 23:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that because they,
hospitals, are particularly
vulnerable, or was it
because they were targeted

23:21.133 --> 23:22.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
specifically?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC GELLER: It's
unclear right now.

23:23.666 --> 23:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think they were
probably targeted.

23:25.766 --> 23:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One sort of conspiracy theory
here is that this wasn't meant
to be released when it was,

23:28.733 --> 23:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that it was sort of a test.

23:30.766 --> 23:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were trying to figure
out what would happen, and it
got out, and perhaps the way

23:33.466 --> 23:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was initially configured,
it ended up going to the
National Health Service first.

23:36.933 --> 23:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Either way, I would say
probably not accidental.

23:40.733 --> 23:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These things have to be coded.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got to be targeted
at particular entities.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard for me to imagine that
the scale that we saw with the
NHS, that that was completely

23:48.300 --> 23:50.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
random.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I should say that
U.S. officials and private
cyber-security firms
have really, I think,

23:53.100 --> 23:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at this point no idea
who it is, although they
are pursuing some leads.

23:55.966 --> 24:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, just
for our viewers out there who
are worried, could this strike

24:00.133 --> 24:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, what can I do to protect
myself, can you give just us a
quick digital computer hygiene

24:05.966 --> 24:08.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lesson?

24:08.000 --> 24:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the things people
should do to stop this
from happening to them?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC GELLER: Yes.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the number one thing
is, you want to patch Windows.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're running Windows --
and I think a lot of people
out there are -- make sure that

24:14.133 --> 24:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're using -- you should be
running Windows 10, which is...

24:16.900 --> 24:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, when
you get those software update
notifications, do those.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC GELLER: Do them right away.

24:21.300 --> 24:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're much better off doing
that and just making sure
that Microsoft is finding all

24:25.700 --> 24:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the things that could go wrong.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just you have got
to install everything
whenever it comes out there.

24:29.700 --> 24:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then also I would say, if
you're running Windows XP --
and I hope to God that very

24:33.500 --> 24:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few of your viewers are running
Windows XP - - but if you are,
you should throw that computer

24:37.266 --> 24:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away and get a new one as soon
as possible, because Microsoft
is not going to support

24:40.800 --> 24:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these kind of critical patches
for Windows XP forever.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And,
of course, don't click on
those dodgy-looking e-mails.

24:45.733 --> 24:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC GELLER: Absolutely.

24:47.233 --> 24:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Eric Geller
of Politico, thank you so much.

24:52.733 --> 24:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC GELLER: Thank you.

24:57.033 --> 25:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea
today hailed its test of a new
intermediate-range missile and

25:04.000 --> 25:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claimed that it can now hit
U.S. bases in the Pacific
with a nuclear warhead.

25:10.033 --> 25:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State TV broadcast footage
of Sunday's launch.

25:12.266 --> 25:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The missile traveled nearly
500 miles, but analysts said
it could have a maximum range

25:18.033 --> 25:20.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 2,500 miles.

25:20.166 --> 25:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, just where is the
North in its development
of missile technology
and its nuclear program?

25:26.166 --> 25:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For that, we turn
to Jeffrey Lewis.

25:28.766 --> 25:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the director of the
East Asia Non-Proliferation
Program at the Middlebury
Institute of International

25:34.000 --> 25:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Studies in Monterey, California.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Lewis, thank you
very much for joining us.

25:39.900 --> 25:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This sounds like quite
an advance on the part
of the North Koreans.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tell us more about
this missile test.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What exactly was it yesterday?

25:48.600 --> 25:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY LEWIS, Director,
East Asia Non-Proliferation
Program, Monterey
Institute of International

25:50.133 --> 25:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Studies: Well, it's a
brand-new type of missile.

25:52.300 --> 25:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We'd seen a version of this
in a parade just a month ago,
but what's really striking is,

25:56.633 --> 26:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it seems to use a new
engine that the North
Koreans designed themselves.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the past, normally,
they have copied engines
from other places.

26:03.633 --> 26:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This looks like the first engine
that's fully North Korean, so
it's a big step forward for

26:08.200 --> 26:09.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

26:09.666 --> 26:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does
that mean, a new engine?

26:10.800 --> 26:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does that mean
distance, power, what?

26:13.566 --> 26:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS: Well, what
it really means is know-how.

26:16.900 --> 26:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so, ultimately,
that will translate
into distance and power.

26:20.533 --> 26:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the past, the North
Koreans, by copying missiles, if
we have asked this question can

26:24.966 --> 26:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you build an ICBM, we have
had to imagine how they could
cobble together an ICBM using

26:29.466 --> 26:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parts and pieces from other
engines they have copied.

26:32.666 --> 26:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it looks like they
actually have the design
expertise to build this
kind of missile themselves,

26:36.833 --> 26:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I think in the future that
should lead us toward an ICBM.

26:40.433 --> 26:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as I said in
the introduction, 500 miles, but
the experts are saying it could

26:46.766 --> 26:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
potentially be 2,500 miles.

26:48.766 --> 26:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what is the
potential capacity of this?

26:52.166 --> 26:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS: Right.

26:54.233 --> 26:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, so what the North Koreans
did was, they shot it almost
straight up, because they didn't

26:59.133 --> 27:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to fire it at Alaska.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't want it
to overfly Japan.

27:03.500 --> 27:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, while it only
traveled -- sorry -- I
have to do kilometers --
while it only traveled

27:07.766 --> 27:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 800 kilometers downrange,
it went more than 2,000
kilometers up into space, which

27:14.500 --> 27:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is much higher than,
for example, the
International Space Station.

27:16.533 --> 27:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if they had straightened it
out, it would have been like a
4,500-kilometer range, which

27:20.433 --> 27:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be nearly an
ICBM, but not quite.

27:22.466 --> 27:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that
means they can reach where
-- could reach where?

27:26.500 --> 27:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS:
That missile would just
fall short of Alaska.

27:29.633 --> 27:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
U.S. land, territory.

27:36.500 --> 27:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this -- and your point is
that this is - - it's technology
that the North Koreans,

27:41.800 --> 27:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as far as we know, have
only gained recently?

27:45.333 --> 27:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS:
Well, that's right.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past, they have mostly
copied other countries' engines,
and so there's been kind

27:51.266 --> 27:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a problem with quality
and a real limit on what
they could do with that.

27:55.466 --> 27:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is probably a breakthrough,
in the sense that, now they
have that design expertise

27:59.433 --> 28:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their own, they will be able
to continually improve and make
longer -- longer-range missiles.

28:06.933 --> 28:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was
reading that this says a
lot about their ability
potentially to miniaturize

28:11.600 --> 28:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a warhead, about the ability of
the missile to survive reentry
into the Earth's atmosphere,

28:17.366 --> 28:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once it goes up into space,
comes back down again.

28:19.900 --> 28:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm assuming all of
that is significant.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they haven't
perfected it yet.

28:25.433 --> 28:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are the hurdles that
they still need to overcome?

28:28.900 --> 28:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS: Well,
what they have done are test
all of the parts and pieces.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, for example, we have
seen this new large engine.

28:37.233 --> 28:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have also seen North
Koreans test a different engine
that would work in an ICBM.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen them do
ground tests of the -- it's
called a reentry vehicle.

28:46.966 --> 28:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's basically the ability
to bring the warhead
back into the atmosphere.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, really, what North Korea
has to do is put all those
things together and test them

28:53.500 --> 28:55.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at once.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, that's still in the
future, but it's not
very far in the future.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do
you mean not very far?

28:59.733 --> 29:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS: They could
test an ICBM as soon as this
year, although it's possible

29:06.533 --> 29:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they will take
longer now that they're
designing their own engines.

29:07.466 --> 29:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They may wait and do it right.

29:08.966 --> 29:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I would not -- this is not
a five- or 10-year problem.

29:12.066 --> 29:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a one- or two-
or three-year problem.

29:14.066 --> 29:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hence getting
the attention of U.S. officials
and officials in the reason.

29:20.566 --> 29:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just final quick
question, Jeffrey Lewis.

29:22.700 --> 29:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are the North Koreans figuring
this out because they have
a bunch of smart scientists?

29:27.133 --> 29:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are they sitting around?

29:28.500 --> 29:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they stealing this
information from somewhere else?

29:32.733 --> 29:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do we know how
they're doing this?

29:35.233 --> 29:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS:
Well, in the past,
they had a lot of help.

29:38.766 --> 29:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we would see the
North Koreans poking around
in Russia and Ukraine
looking for technology.

29:42.866 --> 29:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the reason this
particular engine is important
is because it really looks like

29:46.933 --> 29:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something they
designed themselves.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think they have moved
from the point where they are
importing things and stealing

29:52.000 --> 29:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information to actually
designing their own engines.

29:53.866 --> 29:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's a big step.

29:55.566 --> 29:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It
certainly sounds like it.

29:58.566 --> 30:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Lewis with the Monterey
Institute of International
Studies, we thank you.

30:04.600 --> 30:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
®MD-BJEFFREY LEWIS: Thank you.

30:11.533 --> 30:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:20.166 --> 30:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
It's Politics Monday -- what
the fallout from firing the

30:24.700 --> 30:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FBI director means for
the president's agenda.

30:29.133 --> 30:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: As the Islamic State
group faces serious losses
in Syria and Iraq, some of

30:36.200 --> 30:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the group's foreign
fighters are fleeing the
region and returning to
their home countries.

30:39.533 --> 30:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has had an impact across
the region, including in
Tunisia, a country that has sent

30:44.300 --> 30:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more fighters to join
the group than any other.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports
on what kind of welcome
they will be receiving.

30:51.866 --> 30:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A protest earlier
this year on the streets of
Tunis, a sign of democracy

30:58.966 --> 31:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the new Tunisia, where past
demonstrations would have been
brutally suppressed, but also

31:03.466 --> 31:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a sign of lingering
political crisis.

31:06.666 --> 31:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Citizens rallied against the
return of thousands of fellow
Tunisians who have fought abroad

31:10.933 --> 31:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the Islamic State and
other jihadi groups, and
now want to return home.

31:15.466 --> 31:16.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:16.933 --> 31:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAZIHA GOUIDER, Activist:
These people are not Tunisian.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are monsters.

31:20.566 --> 31:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr.
Naziha Gouider helped
organize the protests.

31:23.833 --> 31:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a neurologist
in a well-off suburb
of Tunis and fears the
impact the returnees will

31:29.300 --> 31:29.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:31.233 --> 31:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAZIHA GOUIDER: They are
people who have no nationality.

31:33.733 --> 31:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They decided to go to a place
where -- to have another
nationality, because this place

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is called a state.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: ISIS.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NAZIHA GOUIDER: Yes.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But
family members of those
accused of fighting for
ISIS just want their

31:47.333 --> 31:49.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loved ones home.

31:49.766 --> 31:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
My brother is one of
Tunisia's young people
who were marginalized,

31:53.066 --> 31:55.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who got lost.

31:55.200 --> 31:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Before dawn on a
recent morning, this woman -- we
agreed to conceal her identity

32:01.766 --> 32:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - was on her way to a local
jail to visit her brother, a
young man, she said, who'd

32:06.200 --> 32:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
misled his family and left
to fight in Syria in 2012.

32:08.466 --> 32:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
took him to the airport myself.

32:12.733 --> 32:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what hurts me.

32:14.233 --> 32:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He contacted me and he told
me: "I'm in Syria and I'm OK."

32:18.733 --> 32:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can imagine our situation.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We went mad.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was crying while walking
in the street like a fool

32:24.466 --> 32:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Soon enough,
she says, her brother realized
he'd made a terrible mistake.

32:29.033 --> 32:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eventually, he turned
himself into the Tunisian
Embassy in Turkey.

32:32.466 --> 32:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Returned to Tunis, he now faces
a lengthy prison sentence.

32:36.366 --> 32:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): Now
he has the title of terrorist.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His life is destroyed.

32:41.633 --> 32:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is not the only one.

32:43.733 --> 32:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The U.N.
estimates that between
5,000 to 6,000 Tunisians
joined ISIS to fight

32:49.766 --> 32:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, more
than from any other country.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The response to the returning
fighters is a complicated
one, in a country with a very

32:57.966 --> 33:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fragile democracy and very
real security concerns.

33:05.333 --> 33:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protests in 2011 in Tunisia
peacefully overthrew
longtime dictator Abidine
Ben Ali and sparked

33:10.366 --> 33:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the wider Arab Spring uprisings.

33:12.833 --> 33:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, a democratically elected
coalition government included
Tunisian secularists and

33:18.733 --> 33:20.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Islamists.

33:20.833 --> 33:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country widely seen as
the region's success story, but
one with enormous challenges,

33:27.566 --> 33:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including a stagnant
economy and large numbers
of homegrown terrorists.

33:30.933 --> 33:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2015, 20 tourists were
killed by Islamist gunmen at
Tunis' Bardo Museum, a cultural

33:38.366 --> 33:40.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treasure.

33:40.400 --> 33:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lone gunman killed
38, mostly Brits on holiday,
at a coastal beach resort.

33:45.666 --> 33:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS claimed responsibility
for both attacks.

33:49.033 --> 33:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tunisian-born radicals have
also carried out attacks abroad,
including those in Nice and

33:53.633 --> 33:56.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Berlin in 2016.

33:56.033 --> 34:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities here say about 800
Tunisian fighters have returned
and are now sitting in jails.

34:03.033 --> 34:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But hundreds more may have
snuck into the country
through neighboring Libya.

34:05.666 --> 34:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED IQBAL, Rescue
Association of Tunisians
Trapped Abroad (through
translator): If you

34:07.766 --> 34:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ask any Tunisian family, do
you know of a Tunisian who
has gone to Syria or tried to

34:12.566 --> 34:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go, they will say,
yes, of course we do.

34:15.233 --> 34:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mohamed Iqbal
has spent the last several
years tracking those who left,

34:21.900 --> 34:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and in 2013 formed
an organization to
help them return.

34:24.133 --> 34:25.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A young boy.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHAMED IQBAL: Yes, a young
boy, about 16 years old.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: He was 16
when he went to Libya?

34:31.533 --> 34:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOHAMED IQBAL: Yes, 16
to Libya and to Syria.

34:34.466 --> 34:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Iqbal sees a
lost generation, many of them
poor and vulnerable Tunisians,

34:41.466 --> 34:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
succumbing to economic hardship
and a sophisticated network of
hard-line Islamists recruiting

34:46.500 --> 34:48.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them for jihad.

34:48.466 --> 34:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED IQBAL (through
translator): The lion knows
how to choose its prey.

34:50.700 --> 34:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are recruitment networks
hunting for young people.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The 2011
revolution unleashed
many disparate forces,
including an Islamist

35:01.933 --> 35:04.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
revival.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This video from that time shows
an imam who would later become
minister of religious affairs

35:08.100 --> 35:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during Friday prayers.

35:10.166 --> 35:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It
is the duty of every Muslim
to help our brothers fight in

35:14.100 --> 35:16.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

35:16.166 --> 35:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Many accepted
that call, including Mohamed
Iqbal's younger brother.

35:21.866 --> 35:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We agreed not use his
name or show his face.

35:24.266 --> 35:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
thought, by going, that I would
be helping to send a message

35:27.633 --> 35:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the world: Enough
killings of the Syrian people
and the Muslim people.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been told that,
in Syria, they will employ
us, provide us a house.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you want to get married,
you can do it there.

35:38.033 --> 35:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Despite being
wheelchair-bound, the younger
Iqbal managed to make it to the

35:42.333 --> 35:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian border in 2013,
before his brother
convinced him to come home.

35:49.266 --> 35:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now in a legal limbo
and regularly visited
and watched by police.

35:54.666 --> 35:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mohamed Iqbal acknowledges
that there are hardcore
terrorists among those who left.

35:57.600 --> 36:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants distinctions drawn
and efforts made to incorporate
as many as possible back into

36:03.066 --> 36:05.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

36:05.566 --> 36:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED IQBAL (through
translator): Tunisian
law can't prevent a
citizens from coming back

36:07.500 --> 36:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his home country.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These fighters must return
to their countries, get
arrested, and be rehabilitated.

36:13.100 --> 36:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is better than
they're remaining free
in areas of conflicts.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want them to come back to
society and live normally,
not just as ex-convicts.

36:20.533 --> 36:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They must be producing
something to the society,
not only consuming.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But to
what kind of society?

36:29.233 --> 36:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tied up in Tunisia's
debates, the role of
religion in public life.

36:33.633 --> 36:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former dictatorship
ruthlessly enforced secularism
and closely monitored religious

36:39.233 --> 36:40.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activity.

36:40.900 --> 36:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One result, people
like Imam Omar Mighri
spent years in prison.

36:44.200 --> 36:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, though, he is a moderate
who works with the government
to oppose radical Islamists

36:50.366 --> 36:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whose influence grew
after the revolution.

36:52.366 --> 36:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At his home in a suburb of
Tunis, Imam Mighri told us that
forgiveness is one part of the

36:57.933 --> 37:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equation, along with extensive
re-education programs.

37:01.233 --> 37:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OMAR MIGHRI, Imam (through
translator): Many of them do
not have a proper understanding

37:05.333 --> 37:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Islam and jihad.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're a danger to society
and to our social fabric.

37:09.800 --> 37:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The government,
he says, must do more to reach
radicals in prisons and schools.

37:16.833 --> 37:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
OMAR MIGHRI (through
translator): We asked
the government to give
us the opportunity

37:19.433 --> 37:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to speak to people who
have been jailed and try
to change their path.

37:23.333 --> 37:24.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We were refused.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does the
government have a plan?

37:27.100 --> 37:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, says Colonel Mohktar Ben
Nasr, a retired military officer
who now runs a think tank,

37:34.033 --> 37:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to jail the worst and
monitor others, through tight
security and the rule of law.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

37:40.333 --> 37:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHKTAR BEN NASR (RET.),
Former Tunisian Military
Official (through
translator): ISIS is a beaten

37:41.800 --> 37:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force, so they will come back
in search of safe places.

37:44.300 --> 37:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real difficulty lies
in identifying them,
because many don't return
through the airports

37:47.933 --> 37:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with official documents.

37:50.533 --> 37:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tunisia is
still a young democracy,
finding its way between
the security and these

37:57.333 --> 37:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kinds of new freedoms.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it a difficult
balance even today?

38:01.533 --> 38:03.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOHKTAR BEN NASR (through
translator): Yes, absolutely.

38:05.033 --> 38:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the guaranteed thing
is that there is real freedom,
there is freedom of expression.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this freedom has limits.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when people overstep
those limits, there is chaos.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After
human rights groups issued
reports on abuses by
Tunisian security forces,

38:19.933 --> 38:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil liberties advocates
responded with a campaign called
No to Terrorism, Yes to Human

38:25.000 --> 38:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rights, featuring prominent
Tunisian celebrities.

38:27.933 --> 38:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six years after its
revolution, Tunisia faces
numerous challenges.

38:31.866 --> 38:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It falls to citizens, says
Dr. Naziha Gouider, to
push the country forward.

NAZIHA GOUIDER: Tunisia is full
of competence, of very competent
people, and of people who

38:45.366 --> 38:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
love their country, and
people who think that
progress and changing this
bad image is absolutely

38:53.633 --> 38:55.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible.

38:55.633 --> 38:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you try to draw a new dream
for the Tunisians, all the
Tunisians, this is the solution.

39:01.166 --> 39:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A new dream,
that is, for a new Tunisia.

39:04.000 --> 39:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown in Tunis.

39:11.300 --> 39:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
went well beyond his Republican
predecessors today with a major

39:23.200 --> 39:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
expansion of a policy
that restricts how U.S.
aid can be used for
international health and

39:29.066 --> 39:31.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
family planning.

39:31.100 --> 39:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rule, known as the Mexico
City policy, has often blocked
international assistance

39:37.533 --> 39:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the U.S. Agency for
International Development to
any groups or programs that

39:40.533 --> 39:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
provide or mention abortions.

39:43.066 --> 39:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's new order would
apply to billions of additional
dollars given out by the State

39:48.800 --> 39:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Defense Departments.

39:50.133 --> 39:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham is
back with that story.

39:52.200 --> 39:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The rule,
often referred to as critics
-- I'm sorry -- often referred

39:56.000 --> 40:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to by critics as the gag rule,
was first enacted in 1984.

40:00.733 --> 40:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican presidents
traditionally reinstate
it, and thus limit funding
to NGOs that discuss

40:05.566 --> 40:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or perform abortion.

40:06.966 --> 40:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats, including President
Obama, then repeal it.

40:10.033 --> 40:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During his first few days in
office, President Trump signed
an executive order making it

40:14.266 --> 40:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clear he would reinstate it.

40:16.100 --> 40:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, today, the scope of
it became much clearer.

40:19.166 --> 40:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the past, about $600
million in funding was
covered by the rule.

40:23.533 --> 40:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today's expansion will now
affect nearly $9 billion.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by
Yeganeh Torbati.

40:29.533 --> 40:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She covers the State
Department for Reuters.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the "NewsHour."

40:33.133 --> 40:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI,
Reuters: Thank you.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Very
big expansion of this
policy today, right?

40:37.033 --> 40:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Right.

40:39.133 --> 40:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, before this version of the
policy, under past Republican
administrations, just like

40:46.033 --> 40:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you mentioned, there was
some version of this rule,
but it applied only to
family planning-related

40:50.066 --> 40:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
funding from USAID and
the State Department.

40:53.466 --> 40:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, under this version of
the policy, it is going to
apply to basically all global

41:00.100 --> 41:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health funding provided
by the United States.

41:03.033 --> 41:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's funding under the Defense
Department, under the State
Department, under USAID as

41:06.833 --> 41:08.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

41:08.866 --> 41:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, that's any
U.S. agency, any U.S. department
now falls under this rule?

41:12.066 --> 41:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Right.

41:14.100 --> 41:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to their global
health assistance dollars, they
have to abide by this Mexico

41:17.666 --> 41:19.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
City policy.

41:19.766 --> 41:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So,
specifically, we touched
on this a little bit,
but the rule says, if

41:23.400 --> 41:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you're getting federal
money, you can't perform
or mention abortions.

41:27.700 --> 41:28.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

41:28.700 --> 41:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Right.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's basically the
general version of the rule.

41:32.666 --> 41:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't perform or
mention abortions as
part of family planning.

41:36.333 --> 41:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, U.S. officials said
today when they rolling
out this policy that
they will make exceptions

41:43.900 --> 41:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for abortions performed
basically in the cases of
rape or incest or other
sort of like emergency

41:48.966 --> 41:51.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situations.

41:51.066 --> 41:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, the vast
majority of abortions are
not for those purposes.

41:56.366 --> 41:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're for sort of
family planning purposes.

41:58.366 --> 42:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the funding will be
restricted when it comes to
groups that provide those sorts

42:04.200 --> 42:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of services or mention
them or talk about them.

42:06.500 --> 42:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So,
specifically, what types
of organizations are
going to suddenly see

42:10.366 --> 42:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this potential threat
to their funding?

42:12.366 --> 42:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: It's a wide
array of organizations that
provide global health services.

42:17.133 --> 42:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, previous versions of this
rule didn't include groups
that provide, for example,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HIV/AIDS-related care
or malaria-related care.

42:27.566 --> 42:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, specifically, two major
U.S. programs that provide
that sort of funding to groups

42:34.566 --> 42:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that provide that care, which
are PEPFAR and the President's
Malaria Initiative, those

42:38.866 --> 42:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now come under this rule.

42:41.233 --> 42:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so critics and
especially Democratic
opponents in Congress,
people who oppose this rule,

42:46.900 --> 42:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say that that's going to affect
a wide array of services that
the U.S. has traditionally

42:51.033 --> 42:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funded in some of the most
vulnerable countries, including
parts of Africa, Southwest Asia

42:57.233 --> 42:59.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the like.

42:59.333 --> 43:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And I
understand the Democrats
have been highly
critical of this and say

43:01.200 --> 43:03.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just as you say.

43:03.233 --> 43:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, people who
want to restrict abortions
see this as a huge victory.

43:07.866 --> 43:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that's what they're --
that seems to be the goal here,
right, to restrict abortions

43:11.733 --> 43:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that come via U.S. dollars
all around the world.

43:14.766 --> 43:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Right.

43:16.766 --> 43:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, one thing that's
notable, that we should note,
is that even when the Mexico

43:23.033 --> 43:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City policy is not in
place, meaning under
Democratic administrations,
it's usually one

43:25.666 --> 43:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's been rescinded, federal
law prevents the U.S. funds
from being used to fund abortion

43:34.700 --> 43:36.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
services.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a separate, you know,
federal legal distinction.

43:39.266 --> 43:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This rule applies to U.S.
funding for organizations
that provide abortions
or provide information

43:45.833 --> 43:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about abortions using funds
from other non-U.S. sources.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So that's one
distinction to make.

43:51.633 --> 43:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, yes, you're right.

43:53.733 --> 43:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Groups that support this rule
-- and we heard from a lot of
them today -- say that, you

43:57.300 --> 44:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, they're ensuring that
U.S. funds aren't sitting groups
even that support these sorts

44:01.300 --> 44:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of abortion policies that
they don't agree with.

44:04.933 --> 44:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're really
lauding President Trump's
action and the State
Department's implementation

44:10.666 --> 44:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that rule today.

44:12.733 --> 44:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, if
an organization currently is
being funded by the U.S., and

44:19.500 --> 44:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they do mention or
perform abortions somehow,
can they simply change
their mission and still

44:22.133 --> 44:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
receive money, or are they
going to be cut regardless?

44:24.133 --> 44:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: No, so the
U.S. officials that we spoke
to today and that we heard from

44:28.866 --> 44:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say that they're -- one thing
that they were at pains to
acknowledge is that this is not

44:33.233 --> 44:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a cut in funding.

44:35.366 --> 44:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. is going to continue
to provide about $6 billion a
year to PEPFAR, for instance,

44:41.666 --> 44:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and $620 million for
this malaria initiative.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they want to continue the
funding and they intend to.

44:47.100 --> 44:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they say they're going
to do is, they're going to ask
their partners abroad to sort

44:51.400 --> 44:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of agree to a clause that says
they are not going to talk about
or provide abortion services.

44:56.333 --> 45:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if those partners say
that they can't do it, then the
U.S. officials say that they

45:00.866 --> 45:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will basically find
other partners that they
believe are going to
still be able to provide

45:04.833 --> 45:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these services in
an effective manner.

45:07.733 --> 45:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it will basically require
not a cut in funding, but
a reallocation of funding.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I see.

45:13.633 --> 45:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: And we will
have to see, you know, is
that going to be difficult on

45:15.133 --> 45:17.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the ground?

45:17.166 --> 45:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that going to restrict
the number of partners that
the U.S. can work with?

45:18.766 --> 45:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How is that actually
going to be implemented?

45:20.566 --> 45:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Yeganeh Torbati,
thank you very much.

45:23.966 --> 45:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI:
Thank you, William.

45:31.466 --> 45:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From this
afternoon's Washington
Post story that President
Trump may have shared

45:38.133 --> 45:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classified information with
the Russians, to his firing
of James Comey almost a week

45:44.733 --> 45:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, we look at what all this
means for the future of the
Trump administration's agenda

45:47.966 --> 45:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with our Politics
Monday team, Amy Walter
of The Cook Political
Report and Tamara Keith

45:53.966 --> 45:55.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of NPR.

45:55.066 --> 45:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it looked as if today,
Amy, the White House was trying
to project an air of calm,

46:01.033 --> 46:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to tamp everything down,
the aftermath of the hurrah,
hoopla over the firing of the

46:07.933 --> 46:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI director, but then late
this afternoon this report
coming from The Washington Post,

46:11.200 --> 46:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's now confirmed by The
New York Times, by the
Reuters news service, Tam.

46:15.266 --> 46:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're hearing BuzzFeed
and other organizations.

46:17.333 --> 46:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're also hearing, as we sit
here, that the White House is
gathering the national security

46:22.133 --> 46:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adviser to go out and talk
to the press about it.

46:24.633 --> 46:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it just seems as if, Amy,
this White House is having a
hard time keeping news and bad

46:31.633 --> 46:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
news under control.

46:33.033 --> 46:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: That's right.

46:35.066 --> 46:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for the first time
this week, this didn't come
from the president himself.

46:37.133 --> 46:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, a lot of the damage
that was done over the course
of last week and into the

46:40.700 --> 46:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weekend were his own tweets.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, it's people
leaking information
about this president's
conversation with the

46:49.333 --> 46:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russians that have gotten
him into hot water and the
administration into hot water.

46:52.900 --> 46:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it goes really to the
fundamental question here, which
is, who is driving the train at

46:58.833 --> 47:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that White House?

47:00.600 --> 47:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no focus,
there's no strategy.

47:04.300 --> 47:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is -- it seems to me we
go day to day without a bigger,
broader, you know, comprehensive

47:11.633 --> 47:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strategy and messaging
and discipline.

47:14.800 --> 47:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that was how Donald
Trump ran his campaign.

47:17.833 --> 47:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was how he
ran his businesses.

47:20.833 --> 47:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Running the government
like this is proving to
be much more difficult.

47:25.266 --> 47:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, a lot
of this seems to have to do
with the White House staff and

47:30.100 --> 47:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether they are pleasing
the president, whether
they are doing the job
they're supposed to

47:34.633 --> 47:36.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

47:36.733 --> 47:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were reports over the
weekend of maybe a shakeup of
staff, people were going to be

47:39.700 --> 47:42.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fired.

47:42.200 --> 47:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, in my interview
earlier in the program
with Greg Jaffe of The
Washington Post, he

47:44.700 --> 47:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, typically, it's staff
who brief the president before
they meet with someone like

47:49.233 --> 47:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a foreign minister
and an ambassador.

47:51.466 --> 47:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the staff is a big
part of the focus here.

47:54.633 --> 47:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: But, by all accounts,
the staff has been briefing

47:57.833 --> 48:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president, and the
president plays it by the field.

48:04.266 --> 48:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just -- he does what
feels right in the moment.

48:07.433 --> 48:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has talked about
this, that he's flexible,
that he improvises.

48:11.866 --> 48:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's hard to build
a communication strategy
around improvisation.

48:16.700 --> 48:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, what we saw last week,
with the White House coming
out with talking points, the

48:23.700 --> 48:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vice president repeating those
talking points repeatedly,
and then the president of the

48:26.233 --> 48:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States going on
television and directly
contradicting the talking
points and the vice

48:30.766 --> 48:32.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe what the vice
president said was more true
than what all of the others were

48:34.800 --> 48:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, but it creates
this cloud that just hangs
over the administration.

48:41.700 --> 48:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now you have H.R. McMaster,
the national security adviser,
coming out to brief the

48:47.066 --> 48:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
press, to push back on
this Washington Post story.

48:49.166 --> 48:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, you know, last
week, they came out and
they pushed a narrative,
and then the president

48:54.633 --> 48:55.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contradicted it.

48:55.866 --> 48:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's going to
happen this week?

48:57.066 --> 48:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
And we don't know.

48:57.900 --> 49:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

49:00.533 --> 49:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is happening, of
course, as the president
is getting ready to go
overseas on his first

49:02.466 --> 49:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international trip to
some of our most important
allies, Saudi Arabia, Israel.

49:09.133 --> 49:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is obviously going to
be on the minds of the people
that he's going to visit.

49:11.866 --> 49:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're talking about
potentially sharing classified
information with an adversary,

49:18.333 --> 49:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what are our allies going
to be thinking about this?

49:20.366 --> 49:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and we're
watching as comments from
the senator -- United States

49:24.233 --> 49:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senators coming in on both
sides of the political aisle.

49:26.833 --> 49:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

49:28.900 --> 49:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We saw Senator
John Warner saying something to
the effect, this is troubling.

49:34.866 --> 49:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw Senator John McCain
saying, if it's true, it
would be very concerning.

49:40.533 --> 49:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans, to both of
you, they're not embracing
- - not all of them are
embracing the way this

49:46.666 --> 49:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House has handled
the FBI story either.

49:49.066 --> 49:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's correct.

49:51.100 --> 49:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was talking to a Republican
senator last week who wanted
more details, wanted more

49:56.133 --> 49:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
information about the timing.

49:58.566 --> 50:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see a lot of Republicans
in Congress saying, I
need more information,
we need more details.

50:02.433 --> 50:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the Comey thing, they are
going to get a briefing this
week by the deputy attorney

50:06.166 --> 50:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
general, Rod Rosenstein.

50:08.700 --> 50:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of the reactions
to this, this latest
story are, well, we want
to know what's really

50:14.400 --> 50:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening, we want to hear
from the administration.

50:16.466 --> 50:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is maybe a bit of
teensy-weensy bit of
distancing themselves
from the administration,

50:21.366 --> 50:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but that is not...

50:22.366 --> 50:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But it's not.

50:23.600 --> 50:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: But
not really, no.

50:24.366 --> 50:25.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: No.

50:25.366 --> 50:27.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:27.433 --> 50:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We have not seen --
yes, we have not seen -- there
is no sort of bottom dropping

50:28.400 --> 50:30.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

50:30.900 --> 50:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't see an en masse
refusal of Republicans
to support this
administration or to call

50:35.600 --> 50:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the president to
do something different.

50:38.866 --> 50:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot of what you're
seeing is the fact that the
Republican base voters still

50:43.466 --> 50:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
united around this president.

50:45.566 --> 50:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This NBC/Wall Street Journal
poll that came out this week,
I think came out yesterday,

50:49.666 --> 50:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support, approval rating among
people who voted for Trump
87 percent, among Republicans

50:55.433 --> 50:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in general, 82 percent.

50:57.366 --> 51:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number that should worry
Republicans, though, especially
those who sit in swing

51:01.266 --> 51:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states, swing districts is
this; 35 percent of independents
give him a positive approval

51:08.066 --> 51:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rating, only 35 percent.

51:10.433 --> 51:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a danger number.

51:12.733 --> 51:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for most of these
Republicans, as we know, they
sit in Republican districts.

51:16.666 --> 51:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Only 23 House members
sit in a district that
Hillary Clinton carried.

51:20.966 --> 51:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very few senators up in this
next election sit in a state
Hillary Clinton carried.

51:25.200 --> 51:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Only one, in fact, does.

51:26.966 --> 51:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's some of their
calculation, too.

51:28.566 --> 51:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bottom hasn't dropped outs
on Trump among his own voters.

51:33.100 --> 51:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans now sort of sitting
and waiting to see how much
longer they can wait before

51:38.966 --> 51:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have to do something.

51:40.966 --> 51:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meanwhile,
Tam, there is the agenda
that the president had been

51:43.033 --> 51:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about, overhauling
health care, coming up with
a health care replacement.

51:47.333 --> 51:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is still in motion.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tax reform.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You go down the list.

51:53.400 --> 51:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, and
those things were stalling
a little bit, or they
were going to take some

51:56.800 --> 51:58.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

51:58.033 --> 52:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So nobody's talking
about them now.

52:00.233 --> 52:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody's looking at the minutia
of -- Republicans senators are
continuing to meet, Republicans

52:03.733 --> 52:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senators continuing to meet to
talk about health care reform
or to talk about how they'd

52:08.666 --> 52:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
repeal and replace the
Affordable Care Act.

52:11.600 --> 52:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's happening at a very low
simmer, very much out of view.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is this remarkable thing.

52:17.533 --> 52:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president is about to leave
the country to go overseas to
meet with all these allies.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm going on that trip.

52:25.633 --> 52:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unclear to me whether I'm
going to be reporting on what
the president is doing overseas

52:29.800 --> 52:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or whether I will be reporting
on the continued kerfuffle and
drama that has been coming out

52:36.166 --> 52:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this White House.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Can I
make one more point?

52:38.200 --> 52:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

52:39.166 --> 52:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Do we have time?

52:41.200 --> 52:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the one thing I also want
to say about this agenda is,
the problem is not simply

52:42.800 --> 52:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this is distracting him
from pushing an agenda forward.

52:46.433 --> 52:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The problem is that the
agenda itself is not
particularly popular.

52:49.600 --> 52:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The health care bill that the
House passed, and you look at
all the polls that have been

52:53.733 --> 52:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released since it's passed,
at best, it gets an approval
rating somewhere in the 30s.

52:58.066 --> 53:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This NBC poll, 48 percent
said they thought it was
bad, only 23 percent good.

53:05.066 --> 53:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's as bad as any poll
they took when Obamacare,
at its lowest, was polling.

53:08.866 --> 53:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

53:10.133 --> 53:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A lot to consider here,
and it keeps on coming.

53:13.633 --> 53:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Indeed.

53:15.033 --> 53:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara
Keith, we thank you both.

53:16.033 --> 53:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.

53:17.033 --> 53:18.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

53:18.266 --> 53:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
Tamara, safe travels.

53:19.066 --> 53:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.

53:21.566 --> 53:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And updating
now our top story: The
Washington Post and now
other news organizations

53:23.833 --> 53:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are reporting that President
Trump divulged highly sensitive
intelligence information

53:30.833 --> 53:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the Islamic State group
to top Russian diplomats, and
may have jeopardized the source

53:34.766 --> 53:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that information.

53:37.333 --> 53:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the deputy
national security adviser
is denying this, and says
the story is -- quote

53:41.333 --> 53:43.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - "false."

53:43.400 --> 53:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson is saying
that the president
never discussed sources,

53:46.966 --> 53:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
methods or military operations.
