evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.675 --> 00:13.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: a big win for
conservatives at the polls.
Republican

00:13.580 --> 00:20.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt Bevin easily takes the
Kentucky governor's race and
Ohio says no to legalizing pot.

00:20.053 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday, looking back at the
assassination of Israeli

00:25.392 --> 00:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
twenty years later -- how the
event still shapes the politics

00:29.963 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Middle East.

00:32.266 --> 00:38.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And actor Jeff
Daniels on bringing theater to
his hometown in rural Michigan.

00:38.305 --> 00:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS, Actor/Playwright:
You have to get them to not just
go to the plays that

00:43.510 --> 00:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a happy ending. Is it a
comedy? OK, it's not a comedy.
When's the next comedy? I will

00:50.517 --> 00:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come to that. And you have to
get those people to take a
chance once in awhile.

00:54.621 --> 01:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:01.094 --> 01:05.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.499 --> 01:14.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's growing
talk tonight that a bomb brought
down that Russian airliner

01:14.875 --> 01:21.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
The Metrojet passenger plane
broke up and crashed Saturday

01:21.181 --> 01:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a flight from Sharm el-Sheikh
to Saint Petersburg, killing all
224 people on board.

01:27.754 --> 01:32.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the Associated Press and
others say U.S. intelligence
believes Islamic State militants

01:32.960 --> 01:36.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
may have planted the bomb.

01:36.063 --> 01:40.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That follows similar reports out
of Cairo and London, as we hear
from Alex Thomson of

01:40.167 --> 01:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Independent Television News.

01:43.136 --> 01:48.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: After days of
inevitable speculation based
upon not much, today, something
altogether

01:48.342 --> 01:52.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more substantial appears
to be building.

01:52.112 --> 01:57.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early this afternoon, Egyptian
media reports indicated the
plane had suffered an explosion

01:57.517 --> 02:03.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in one engine. They sourced this
to black box flight recorder
investigations, which

02:03.323 --> 02:07.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue, then the statement
from Downing Street that, as
more information has come

02:07.861 --> 02:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to light -- quote -- "We have
become concerned that the plane
may well have been brought

02:11.965 --> 02:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down by an explosive device."

02:15.535 --> 02:17.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK MCLOUGHLIN, British
Transportation Minister: As a
precautionary measure, we have

02:17.371 --> 02:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decided that flights due to
leave Sharm el-Sheikh this
evening for the U.K. will be
delayed.

02:22.642 --> 02:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that will allow us time to
ensure that the right security
measures are in place for

02:28.081 --> 02:30.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flights.

02:30.050 --> 02:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Extra consular
staff has also been sent to
Sharm's airport to assist
British

02:34.287 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
holiday makers. There are
currently around 15,000 tourists
in the resort from Britain.

02:40.527 --> 02:44.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Downing Street said it
recognizes these moves will
cause some anxiety, but its
travel advice

02:44.698 --> 02:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Sharm remains unchanged.
Essentially, The Foreign Office
advises Red Sea resorts

02:50.303 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are fine, but many other areas,
Sinai in particular, where the
Russian plane came down, should

02:54.641 --> 02:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be considered off-limits.

02:57.110 --> 03:03.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At least 36 people
died in a cargo plane crash in
South Sudan today. The
Russian-built

03:03.817 --> 03:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plane went down shortly after
taking off from the capital,
Juba, headed for a region of

03:08.855 --> 03:14.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oil fields. Wreckage was strewn
across a wide area along the
banks of the Nile River. Early

03:14.795 --> 03:18.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indications were that security
officials may have allowed too
many people on board.

03:18.932 --> 03:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Malaysia,
disputes over China's claims in
the South China Sea dominated

03:24.871 --> 03:29.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a meeting of U.S. and Asian
defense ministers. The gathering
ended without a public
statement,

03:29.810 --> 03:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when China insisted there be no
mention of territorial disputes.

03:34.581 --> 03:38.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, U.S. Defense Secretary
Ash Carter played down the
tensions, but acknowledged
China's

03:38.919 --> 03:41.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
neighbors are worried.

03:41.354 --> 03:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: I had no expectation
that everyone would agree on

03:45.725 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the South China Sea or any other
issue. That's the reason for
this forum, is to discuss these

03:52.666 --> 04:00.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues, and that reflects, I,
think the level of concern that
was reflected in the
conversation

04:00.607 --> 04:05.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about activities in
the South China Sea.

04:05.212 --> 04:11.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Carter
also defended U.S. Navy patrols
in the contested waters.

04:11.318 --> 04:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To underscore the point, he will
be on the U.S. aircraft carrier
Theodore Roosevelt as

04:16.022 --> 04:19.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it transits the South
China Sea on Thursday.

04:19.626 --> 04:24.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Canada's new prime
minister, Justin Trudeau, was
sworn in today. He took office

04:24.965 --> 04:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during a ceremony in Ottawa,
becoming, at the age of 43, the
country's second youngest

04:30.437 --> 04:35.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prime minister ever. Trudeau
succeeds Conservative Stephen
Harper.

04:35.609 --> 04:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the U.S.
presidential race, the filing
period opened for New
Hampshire's

04:40.413 --> 04:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first-in-the-nation primary in
February. Donald Trump was the
first major candidate on the

04:46.553 --> 04:52.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican side to submit his
papers and pay the $1,000 filing
fee. Former Maryland Governor

04:52.626 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Martin O'Malley registered on
the Democratic side. He's been a
distant also-ran, but he

04:57.831 --> 05:01.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said voters are just starting
to focus on the election.

05:01.368 --> 05:05.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The chair of the
Federal Reserve is suggesting
again that short-term interest

05:05.672 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates could rise before year's
end. Speaking at a House
committee hearing today, Janet

05:10.677 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yellen said the Fed has yet to
make a final decision. She told
lawmakers it all depends

05:16.316 --> 05:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on whether the economy is still
performing well, as well as
other key factors.

05:20.954 --> 05:26.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: If the incoming
information supports that
expectation,

05:26.726 --> 05:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then our statement indicates
that December would be a live
possibility, but, importantly,

05:31.965 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we have made no
decision about it.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Separately, Yellen
warned that the nation's biggest
banks still aren't doing

05:39.739 --> 05:43.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough to guard against
serious financial shocks.

05:43.376 --> 05:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The latest look
at Europe's economy shows it's
growing only modestly.

05:48.515 --> 05:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A closely-watched monthly
survey, out today, found that
economic activity across the
Eurozone

05:54.120 --> 05:58.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't enough to make a dent in
unemployment. That could push
the European Central Bank

05:58.425 --> 06:01.661 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to increase its
stimulus efforts.

06:01.661 --> 06:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Volkswagen stock
plummeted nearly 10 percent in
European trading today after

06:06.800 --> 06:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new revelation. The company
acknowledged Tuesday it
understated dioxide emissions
for

06:11.037 --> 06:15.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some 800,000 cars, most
of them in Europe.

06:15.508 --> 06:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost 50
points to close below 17870.

06:21.848 --> 06:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell two points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slid seven.

06:26.486 --> 06:31.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour": what yesterday's
election results say about

06:31.091 --> 06:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voter sentiment; why more
middle-aged white Americans are
dying; capturing harmful methane

06:37.264 --> 06:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
emissions, and much more.

06:44.170 --> 06:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From a significant
win in a key governor's race to
a number of ballot initiatives,

06:57.050 --> 07:02.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conservatives had a big day
at the polls yesterday.

07:02.289 --> 07:07.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was one of the night's
headline issues. Supporters
hoped Ohio would be the first
Midwestern

07:07.661 --> 07:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state to legalize marijuana for
medical and recreational use.
But by nearly 2-1, voters

07:14.534 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gave that a resounding no. The
same conservative wave cost
Kentucky Democrats their
longtime

07:20.907 --> 07:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hold on the governor's mansion.
Attorney General Jack Conway
lost to Republican Matt Bevin,

07:26.413 --> 07:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who opposed the federal health
care law and gay marriage.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATT BEVIN (R), Kentucky
Governor-Elect: I'm grateful
that you all went to the ballot
box.

07:33.753 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those that are watching, and
those that have collectively
decided that we want a fresh

07:38.358 --> 07:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
start, that we want to turn the
page, this is your Kentucky.

07:42.228 --> 07:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, in
Houston, an ordinance to curb
discrimination against gays and
transgender

07:46.399 --> 07:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people went down to defeat.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Outgoing Mayor Annise Parker,
the nation's only lesbian mayor,
lamented the outcome.

07:52.939 --> 07:58.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNISE PARKER (D), Mayor of
Houston, Texas: I fear that this
will have stained Houston's

07:58.912 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reputation as a tolerant,
welcoming global city. And I
absolutely fear that there will

08:06.219 --> 08:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a direct economic backlash as
a result of this ordinance going
into defeat.

08:11.791 --> 08:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But the Family
Research Council and other
conservative groups praised the

08:16.763 --> 08:22.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
result. Council President Tony
Perkins called it "a rallying
cry for those tired of seeing

08:22.302 --> 08:28.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their freedoms trampled in a
politically correct stampede to
redefine marriage and
sexuality."

08:28.908 --> 08:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In San Francisco, it was freedom
to rent that topped the ballot.
Voters handed a victory

08:34.180 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the online site Airbnb, which
was founded in the city by the
bay, refusing to limit

08:39.252 --> 08:43.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how often home owners
may rent out rooms.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For more on last night's
results, we turn now to Stu
Rothenberg of The
Rothenberg-Gonzales

08:47.927 --> 08:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Political Report, and Molly
Hennessy-Fiske, Houston bureau
chief for The Los Angeles Times.

08:53.767 --> 08:58.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Stu, the Republicans or
conservative causes had gains on
issues. They had gains on
candidates.

08:58.972 --> 09:02.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's start in Kentucky. How did
Matt Bevin confound the polls?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The Rothenberg &amp;
Gonzales Political Report: Well,

09:04.110 --> 09:06.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen, you're right. Almost all
the pollsters got it wrong, and
there are a number of possible

09:06.613 --> 09:10.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
explanations.

09:10.216 --> 09:15.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To some extent, they always had
Jack Conway, the Democrat,
running in the mid-40s, but

09:15.155 --> 09:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a two- to five-point lead.
He ended up losing, but he also
got in the mid-40s, just

09:19.726 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they predicted. It could
have been that the undecided
voters swung, swung dramatically

09:22.662 --> 09:24.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Republican.

09:24.931 --> 09:29.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, I think it's
more likely that it was a late
break in cultural issues,

09:29.169 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social issues, issues like
Planned Parenthood funding
that's -- that's been a big
issue

09:34.340 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- same-sex marriage, religious
liberty. Cultural issues seem to
take hold.

09:39.879 --> 09:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, also, there's one other
thing I think you have to
consider. That is, Kentucky has

09:44.284 --> 09:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been moving Republican over the
past few decades. And it is now
reliably Republican in federal

09:50.423 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
races. State races tend to be
different. The minority party,
the wrong party, can sometimes

09:53.927 --> 09:56.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
win statewide offices.

09:56.963 --> 10:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in this case, Republicans
did go to the Barack Obama well
again and again, and it

10:03.169 --> 10:05.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
may well be that these
Republicans voters just decided
they couldn't vote for a
Democrat

10:05.371 --> 10:07.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for governor.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You talk about
trends. There was, obviously, a
trend towards Republicans in

10:11.744 --> 10:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kentucky. But on social issues
like in Ohio, the marijuana
legalization vote, there have

10:18.485 --> 10:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always been -- we have always
been headed in the other
direction, and Ohio said no
resoundingly.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, in
Ohio, it might have been just
too much, too fast in terms

10:25.625 --> 10:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of recreational marijuana usage.

10:29.863 --> 10:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it was more than that. It
was the ballot measure itself.
Sometimes, the actual structure

10:34.767 --> 10:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the measures matter. And in
this case, I think that folks in
Ohio were unhappy that

10:40.707 --> 10:43.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a select group of growers and
investors were going to get, in
fact, a monopoly on this

10:43.443 --> 10:48.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Ohio on marijuana.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was a significant
factor. And it's funny. There
are people who supported
legalization

10:51.317 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of marijuana who opposed
this initiative.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Because of the
way it was structured.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Because of
the structure of the measure.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, we don't
pay enough attention to what
happens in statehouses,

10:59.792 --> 11:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but in Virginia last night,
there had been a big push for
Democrats to try to take control

11:03.196 --> 11:06.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the statehouse, and
it didn't work out.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: It didn't
because the Republicans held
their seats and the Democrats
held their

11:08.668 --> 11:13.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seats, and so the Republicans
still have a 21-19 advantage in
the Virginia State Senate.

11:13.940 --> 11:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On one level, that's so -- what
else is new? Nothing's new,
really. But this was a bit

11:19.145 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a black eye for the governor,
Terry McAuliffe, known as a
great fund-raiser and a savvy
political

11:25.018 --> 11:30.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operative, a friend of the
Clintons, all the Clintons. He
could not work his magic and

11:30.056 --> 11:34.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
flip a seat, so that the
Democrats control the Senate.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't -- I don't think it
fundamentally changes the
dynamic of the politics there.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it is an embarrassment
for the governor.

11:39.799 --> 11:44.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Molly
Hennessy-Fiske, how did the
Houston discrimination
ordinance, or

11:44.237 --> 11:50.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ordinance, how did it
rise and how did it fall?

11:50.743 --> 11:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE, The Los
Angeles Times: Well, it lost
pretty resoundingly 61 to 39

11:53.613 --> 11:55.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

11:55.515 --> 12:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both sides had thought that it
was going to be a very close
race. The mayor had championed

12:00.620 --> 12:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, made it a personal cause of
hers, Mayor Annise Parker. The
city council had already

12:06.159 --> 12:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voted for it and approved it,
and then there was this
protracted legal battle and
political

12:10.430 --> 12:14.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battle that led to it being
placed on the ballot.

12:14.334 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it was a pretty big victory
for the conservatives who had
petitioned and sued to get it
put

12:19.372 --> 12:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the ballot, put to a vote,
and now they'd like to have it
all put to rest, but some

12:23.242 --> 12:26.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
folks are still vowing
to fight for it.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, let's be clear.
This was an ordinance that would
have prohibited discrimination

12:29.148 --> 12:31.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against gays and --
LGBT individuals...

12:31.818 --> 12:33.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE:
That's right.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... which had passed
in other cities around Texas,
but this became defined

12:37.557 --> 12:39.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differently.

12:39.292 --> 12:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's listen to a little bit
of one ad that we heard. It was
Houston Astros star

12:44.297 --> 12:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lance Berkman. Let's listen.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANCE BERKMAN, Houston Astros:
I'm Lance Berkman. I played
professional baseball for 15
years,

12:52.772 --> 12:57.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but my family is more important.
My wife and I have four
daughters. Proposition 1 would

12:57.143 --> 13:01.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow troubled men who claim to
be women to enter women's
bathrooms, showers, and locker

13:01.748 --> 13:05.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rooms. It's better to prevent
this danger by closing women's
restrooms to men, rather

13:05.151 --> 13:07.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than waiting for a
crime to happen.

13:07.820 --> 13:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Molly, this was
about transgender issues, not
really about anti-discrimination

13:11.658 --> 13:13.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the end. It was redefined.

13:13.292 --> 13:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE: Well, it
depends who is talking about it.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say both sides would
probably say it's more
complicated than that. This
measure

13:22.335 --> 13:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did end up getting dubbed the
bathroom ordinance, like you
heard in that ad by a former
Houston

13:29.842 --> 13:37.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Astro. But even the
conservatives who scored a
victory with this said it means
more to

13:37.216 --> 13:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them than that. They felt like
the other thing that was at
issue was religious liberty,
that

13:42.155 --> 13:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if, for instance, a florist was
asked by a same-sex couple to do
the, you know, flowers

13:50.396 --> 13:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for their wedding, that if they
said no, under this ordinance,
they could face penalties

13:53.032 --> 13:56.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or be sued.

13:56.002 --> 14:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the pro-ordinance campaign
has said it was about way more
than bathrooms. In fact,

14:02.375 --> 14:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mayor repeatedly said that
the ordinance didn't
specifically talk about
bathrooms,

14:07.313 --> 14:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she felt like that was a lot
of fear-mongering and a scare
tactic that spread a lot of
misinformation,

14:13.619 --> 14:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that today she even said at
a press conference that she felt
like the voters weren't really

14:18.157 --> 14:21.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voting about what the
ordinance was really about.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But in the end,
that's what redefinition --
redefining things does. But in
the end,

14:25.164 --> 14:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they also were able to appeal to
black churches, for instance, to
take the side against the

14:31.471 --> 14:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ordinance, which you would think
an anti-discrimination ordinance
would be appealing to
African-Americans.

14:36.943 --> 14:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE: That's
right. And I talked to some of
those pastors as the campaign

14:41.914 --> 14:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was going on who were very
upset, not just because of the
ordinance and what it says

14:47.353 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what they feared it might
do, but also because, in the
process of the legal battle,

14:51.424 --> 14:55.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the city had subpoenaed
some of their sermons.

14:55.394 --> 14:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they really got their backs
up about that, felt like that
was an infringement on freedom

14:59.232 --> 15:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of religion, and freedom of
speech, and even though the city
backed off, they felt like

15:02.702 --> 15:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were under attack and they
had to work to lobby against
this.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And there is a
mayoral runoff which is also --
this may get played out against

15:08.407 --> 15:11.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Houston.

15:11.077 --> 15:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stu, it's always possible to
overreach and overinterpret
these from a national point

15:16.349 --> 15:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of view, but I wonder what the
parties, the individual parties
and the wings of those

15:20.586 --> 15:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parties are taking from all
these results yesterday.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, the
Republicans, at least in their
P.R. releases, are saying

15:27.193 --> 15:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something big happened, a string
of Republican victories in
Virginia. They're predicting

15:31.197 --> 15:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this shows the turnaround,
Virginia's coming back the
Republican column.

15:35.401 --> 15:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm hesitant to read very much
outside of Kentucky, the
particular circumstances in

15:40.439 --> 15:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ohio and Houston, example. Look,
next year, we're going to have a
different kind of election

15:47.146 --> 15:51.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with a different kind of
electorate, where the election
will be about -- I'm not sure

15:51.184 --> 15:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it's going to be about, but
it could be about Hillary
Clinton or the Republican

15:54.253 --> 15:59.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nominee or the Middle
East or health care.

15:59.592 --> 16:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once we know that, then we
will have a better sense on the
ebb and flow of the campaigns

16:04.397 --> 16:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the general lay of the
land of the election.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stu Rothenberg of
the Rothenberg-Gonzales
Political Report, and Molly
Hennessy-Fiske

16:10.570 --> 16:14.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of The L.A. Times, thank
you both very much.

16:14.207 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOLLY HENNESSY-FISKE: Thanks.

16:22.415 --> 16:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Death rates in
the United States have declined
steadily for decades. But a

16:31.657 --> 16:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
study out this week found a
disturbing reversal in mortality
rates for white Americans
between

16:36.963 --> 16:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ages of 45 and 54 who do
not hold a college degree.

16:42.802 --> 16:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that group, the rate of
death has climbed since 1999,
even as rates for people of
different

16:48.908 --> 16:55.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ages, races and education levels
have continued to fall. The
causes of death driving the
reversal

16:55.748 --> 17:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were suicide, alcohol-related
liver diseases, and prescription
opioids and heroin overdoses.

17:03.489 --> 17:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined now by one of the
study's authors, Anne Case. She
is a professor of economics

17:08.594 --> 17:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and public affairs at Princeton
University. And by Dante Chinni.
He's a data reporter

17:14.567 --> 17:19.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and he's director of the
American Communities Project, a
political science and journalism

17:19.572 --> 17:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program at Michigan State
University that uses data to
look at social, political and

17:23.676 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cultural divides.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Professor Case, let
me begin with you.

17:30.616 --> 17:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have said that when you and
your husband, who is Professor
Angus Deaton -- he's the

17:35.354 --> 17:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winner of this year's Nobel
Prize, and he was the co-author
of this study -- that when

17:40.393 --> 17:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you came across these numbers,
you basically stumbled across
this information, and that

17:47.066 --> 17:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said you practically fell out
of your chairs. It was that
surprising?

17:49.936 --> 17:54.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE CASE, Princeton University:
It is that surprising.

17:54.006 --> 18:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After so many decades in which
mortality rates fell at 2
percent a year, and the fact
that

18:00.746 --> 18:05.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in all of the sister countries
that we compare ourselves to,
all the wealthy countries of

18:05.384 --> 18:11.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Europe and all the
English-speaking countries,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
with their

18:11.223 --> 18:14.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mortality rates also falling at
2 percent a year, to suddenly
see this reversal was

18:14.894 --> 18:18.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really stunning.

18:18.564 --> 18:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has been stunning to all
of the medical people, the
epidemiologists that we have
talked

18:23.202 --> 18:25.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to as well.

18:25.671 --> 18:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's already --
Professor Case, it's already
being labeled by some as
despair-related

18:30.476 --> 18:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deaths. What is it particularly
about this -- these mortality --
this mortality rate

18:35.381 --> 18:38.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that stood out to you?

18:38.384 --> 18:44.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE CASE: The fact that there
are several parts of this that
are puzzles that we have

18:44.190 --> 18:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to dig into further, the fact
that it's men and women,
mortality rates by suicide, by

18:51.430 --> 18:58.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drug overdose, by
alcohol-related deaths rising
for all of -- for both men and
women, the

18:58.004 --> 19:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that it's not happening in
the African-American community,
it's not happening in the
Hispanic

19:02.775 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community, and it's
not happening abroad.

19:06.312 --> 19:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, all of those things stood
out to us as puzzle pieces that
we have to look into further

19:12.251 --> 19:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to figure out, what are the root
causes of this? We know the
proximate causes, drug overdose,

19:18.357 --> 19:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
availability of prescription
opioids. But I think the next
round of research will be

19:22.528 --> 19:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to look at the deeper causes.

19:25.664 --> 19:30.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dante Chinni, how
does this square with what you
have been seeing as you

19:30.569 --> 19:35.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have looked at the American --
Americans everywhere and as you
think about this cohort we're
talking

19:35.441 --> 19:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, middle-aged Americans,
45-54, white? What have you
seen?

19:40.079 --> 19:43.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI, American
Communities Project: Well, the
way I look at the country, the
breakdown

19:43.549 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we do at the American
Communities Project, is there
are large segments of America
that

19:47.153 --> 19:50.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are made up of large
chunks of this population.

19:50.823 --> 19:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they tend to be rural,
white, not high education
levels, or high school, no
bachelor's

19:57.963 --> 20:03.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or even a community college
degree. And the places those
populations are heavily based

20:03.035 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the Bible Belt, what we call
evangelical hubs, the
Appalachian America, which is
what

20:08.674 --> 20:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we call working-class country,
and then graying America, which
is kind of more based in the

20:13.379 --> 20:18.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North and the West, but
populations, again, elderly --
more -- I don't want to say
elderly,

20:18.150 --> 20:21.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but older people and people
without a lot of college
degrees, overwhelmingly white.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we know about those
places? Higher unemployment
rates than the national average,

20:25.724 --> 20:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher unemployment rates than
other kinds of communities in
the country.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing that really
sticks out about them is, beyond
the unemployment rate, which

20:31.363 --> 20:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be a little bit deceptive,
there is the work force
participation rate. In these
places,

20:35.367 --> 20:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're talking about all these
communities I just outlined, 44
percent, 45 percent of

20:38.304 --> 20:41.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the population not
in the work force.

20:41.807 --> 20:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, look, some of that is
probably due to people have
retired or they want to stay at

20:46.112 --> 20:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home. But I think when you
combine that with the higher
unemployment rates in those
areas,

20:50.883 --> 20:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what you're really
seeing is, in terms of the
difficulty of finding a way to
make

20:53.919 --> 20:55.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a living, right?

20:55.921 --> 20:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a much -- it's a tougher
life in these places now. I
think a lot of this has to do

20:59.258 --> 21:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the decline of small
manufacturing in these places.
Tougher rural life.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you think
about -- Professor Case, you
think about what's happened in
this

21:06.532 --> 21:10.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country to the economy over the
last 15 years, we can't, of
course, jump to any conclusions,

21:10.269 --> 21:16.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but we know jobs -- there's been
a huge change in the job
picture.

21:16.242 --> 21:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know American manufacturing
has taken a big hit. What sorts
of questions does all

21:19.979 --> 21:22.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this raise for you?

21:22.882 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE: It's -- one of the
questions is why it is the case
that the
employment-to-population

21:29.088 --> 21:35.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ratio has fallen so
dramatically, especially among
women.

21:35.094 --> 21:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our surveys, we were able to
look at morbidity, as well as
mortality, so we can actually
find

21:40.966 --> 21:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out how people are, what their
general health is like, what
their mental health is like,

21:46.839 --> 21:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and there's been a doubling in
this 15-year period among people
aged 45-54 who report

21:53.512 --> 21:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they're unable to work.

21:56.815 --> 22:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this used to be the period
of time when people were at
their highest earnings capacity.

22:03.822 --> 22:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to see these people, upwards
of 10 percent of the white
population, saying that they're

22:09.128 --> 22:13.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not able to work is
really troubling.

22:13.432 --> 22:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It used to be the case that,
with a high school degree, you
could get a good job, you could

22:19.038 --> 22:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a job with benefits, you
could get a job that was stable,
that you had job security.

22:25.844 --> 22:35.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think people's narratives
of their own lives had in them
having a job, and the fact

22:35.487 --> 22:42.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that these jobs are gone and
they're not coming back any time
soon leads people to despair.

22:42.928 --> 22:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they report themselves in
worse health. They report lower
mental health, a lot more

22:47.466 --> 22:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stress, a lot more distress. And
I think these mortality rates
just reflect that.

22:53.505 --> 22:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dante Chinni, I
mean, I -- you're nodding your
head as she's saying all this.

22:58.744 --> 23:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this does seem to
dovetail with at least the
circumstances that you find in
your

23:04.149 --> 23:04.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
research.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANTE CHINNI: Yes, absolutely.

23:06.619 --> 23:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I can't -- I would love
to get the professor's data and
run a geographic analysis

23:10.789 --> 23:15.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on it to see if we're seeing
these things fall in line with
what I'm expecting. But

23:15.561 --> 23:17.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is exactly what
we're talking about.

23:17.796 --> 23:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, in a lot of these places,
when you lose a job,
particularly if you're in your
40s,

23:22.334 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's not a lot of places to
go. There's certainly not a lot
of places to go to get

23:24.837 --> 23:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a job where you can earn similar
to what you were earning before.
Maybe the benefits go

23:28.040 --> 23:31.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
away. Maybe the health
insurance goes away.

23:31.310 --> 23:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go out to some of these
places, not just rural America,
but there's a category

23:34.546 --> 23:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we look at call the middle
suburbs, and they're based --
they're overwhelmingly white.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're primarily based in the
Industrial Midwest, the
Northeast, around Pittsburgh,

23:42.121 --> 23:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cleveland, Detroit. Milwaukee,
you see some of it.

23:45.557 --> 23:50.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have large white
populations. A lot of these were
high school-educated people who

23:50.763 --> 23:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did make a really good living.
They had a good life. Their
parents had a good life.

23:53.866 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had a good life. And all of
a sudden, the rules changed,
right? And the idea that

23:58.637 --> 24:00.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a high school education was good
enough, it wasn't good enough
anymore. It wasn't good

24:00.906 --> 24:03.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough to have the cabin
up north anymore.

24:03.242 --> 24:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, suddenly, it wasn't good
enough to have a job anymore.
And that's a very hard thing

24:07.279 --> 24:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to deal with. We will see.
Again, we have got to take
another couple cuts at this
data,

24:11.016 --> 24:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, and see what's there. But
it certainly does fit the
profile.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it's clear that there is
going to be more research. At
least, it looks as if there

24:17.990 --> 24:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is going to be more research
based on what you have done.

24:23.228 --> 24:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Case, thank you very
much for joining us. Professor
Anne Case at Princeton and Dante

24:26.999 --> 24:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chinni here in Washington,
we appreciate it.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANTE CHINNI: Thanks.

24:33.839 --> 24:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNE CASE: Thanks very much.

24:39.978 --> 24:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

24:45.117 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
Middle East conflict 20 years
after an Israeli prime
minister's

24:49.922 --> 24:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assassination; and actor Jeff
Daniels trades in the Big Apple
for the Midwest.

24:55.661 --> 25:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, natural gas is often
considered a cleaner fuel than
coal. It emits about half

25:02.334 --> 25:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as much carbon dioxide. But the
main component in natural gas is
another greenhouse gas:

25:06.572 --> 25:09.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
methane.

25:09.141 --> 25:14.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As special correspondent
Kathleen McCleery explains,
that's why both
environmentalists

25:14.012 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the energy industry are
trying to find ways to capture
leaks from oil and gas
facilities.

25:19.151 --> 25:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: You can't see
it with the naked eye, but
methane gas is escaping into

25:23.989 --> 25:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the air around this well in
Northwestern New Mexico.

25:28.026 --> 25:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Oh, yes. Yes, boy, it's
just blowing up out of the --
off the side of it here.

25:34.833 --> 25:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: You can see
the methane, along with other
emissions, with the help

25:39.571 --> 25:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of an infrared camera, this one
operated by the environmental
group Earthworks.

25:44.276 --> 25:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: There's a lot of leaking
coming from both of those valve
boxes.

25:49.748 --> 25:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Methane is
the primary component of natural
gas. It's also a greenhouse

25:54.353 --> 25:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gas. Like carbon dioxide, it
traps energy in the atmosphere,
and according to the
Environmental

25:59.291 --> 26:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protection Agency, contributes
to climate change. CO2 is far
more prevalent, but methane

26:04.663 --> 26:06.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is much more potent.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANVENDRA DUBEY, Los Alamos
National Laboratory: Methane is
about 25 times more potent a
greenhouse

26:09.868 --> 26:13.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gas on a 100-year
horizon than CO2.

26:13.138 --> 26:18.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Los Alamos
atmospheric scientist Manvendra
Dubey was measuring carbon

26:18.544 --> 26:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dioxide, not methane, last year
when NASA released satellite
images, including this

26:24.750 --> 26:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one showing a 2,500-square-mile
hot spot centered over the Four
Corners area, where New Mexico,

26:30.989 --> 26:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Colorado, Utah and Arizona meet.

26:34.193 --> 26:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MANVENDRA DUBEY: They showed
that, over Four Corners, methane
was enhanced. It was the

26:40.265 --> 26:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- kind of the hottest methane
spot in the whole of continental
U.S.

26:44.169 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Now, Dubey
and others are tracking methane
through ground and aerial

26:48.740 --> 26:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigations aimed at finding
the sources of the hot spot.
Some emissions seep out of

26:54.813 --> 27:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coal beds here in the San Juan
Basin. Some come from
agriculture, including cows.
Winds

27:00.452 --> 27:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow the gas to pool in the
river basin surrounded by
mountains.

27:05.057 --> 27:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nationwide, the EPA traces the
largest amount, about 30
percent, to natural gas and
petroleum.

27:12.030 --> 27:16.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the industry doesn't
accept that figure yet.

27:16.101 --> 27:20.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Wally Drangmeister, vice
president of the New Mexico Oil
and Gas Association, wants

27:20.339 --> 27:23.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the ongoing research to
examine all sources.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALLY DRANGMEISTER, Vice
President, New Mexico Oil and
Gas Association: There are
natural

27:25.143 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outcroppings. There's coal
mining. There's a lot of other
activities, and so we'd really

27:29.748 --> 27:34.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like to see the science
completed, so that we're not
just the only industry or the
only

27:34.920 --> 27:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
source that's getting blamed.

27:37.356 --> 27:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE SCHREIBER, New Mexico:
We're in the middle of nowhere,
but, yes, basically, we're kind

27:42.828 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
of in the middle
of that hot spot.

27:45.497 --> 27:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: At Devil's
Spring Ranch, Don and Jane
Schreiber worry about the
natural

27:50.536 --> 27:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gas wells on their property.
They took us along on a tour in
their retrofitted school

27:55.407 --> 27:59.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bus when the Earthworks
team visited recently.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE BAIZEL, Earthworks: If you
see leakage coming on this
camera, there is leakage, and

28:02.981 --> 28:05.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's really no argument
about it anymore.

28:05.717 --> 28:09.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The
Schreibers' concern goes beyond
climate change to the air
they're

28:09.888 --> 28:14.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
breathing, because other
chemicals like benzene are
emitted along with the methane.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON SCHREIBER, New Mexico: It's
got to be bad, and now we know
it is, and it's in that

28:16.929 --> 28:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cloud, and it's a very,
very sobering thing.

28:21.800 --> 28:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Companies can
drill here because of a law
called split estate. The

28:27.472 --> 28:32.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schreibers own the land above
ground, but the mineral rights
below, in this case owned

28:32.344 --> 28:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the federal government, can
be leased to oil and gas
companies.

28:37.115 --> 28:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 120 wells dot the
Schreibers' ranch, just a
fraction of the tens of
thousands in

28:42.354 --> 28:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nation's second largest
natural gas field.

28:45.924 --> 28:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE SCHREIBER: We went to three
wells today. Every one of them
were either venting or leaking.

28:53.365 --> 28:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those were, you know, less
than a mile from our house.

28:57.135 --> 29:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON SCHREIBER: Well, there are
20,000 existing wells here now,
most of them acting just exactly

29:02.207 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like the wells we saw today.

29:05.844 --> 29:11.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The
Environmental Defense Fund has
spearheaded multiple studies on
methane

29:11.950 --> 29:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emissions. Its energy policy
manager says the problem is not
a tough one to solve.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON GOLDSTEIN, Environmental
Defense Fund: Literally, the
problem is being looked at

29:20.359 --> 29:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by rocket scientists. But the
solutions are largely plumbing.
We are talking about fixing

29:26.565 --> 29:30.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pipes, stopping them from
leaking at natural gas
production sites, and that's
stuff that

29:30.569 --> 29:32.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we know how to do.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MULLINS, CEO, Synergy
Operating, LLC: Anywhere that we
have methane usage, you would

29:35.273 --> 29:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be concerned if you have leaks.

29:38.210 --> 29:42.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Industry is
hunting and fixing methane
emissions, says Tom Mullins,

29:42.881 --> 29:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who owns part of an oil and gas
company in Farmington. We met on
the campus of San Juan

29:47.853 --> 29:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
College's School of Energy,
which offers hands-on training.

29:52.424 --> 29:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM MULLINS: We have been
applying technology, you know,
identifying leaks that are out
there.

29:56.194 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we do that on a daily
basis, as all good industry
folks would do.

30:02.100 --> 30:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: For industry,
doing green is nice. Seeing
green is even better. Captured

30:08.707 --> 30:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
methane can be sold, since it's
essentially natural gas. That's
good for companies and

30:12.944 --> 30:15.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taxpayers.

30:15.113 --> 30:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM MULLINS: We're in the
business of producing methane,
and we would like to get paid
for

30:18.950 --> 30:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, and we would like the public
to get paid for their share of
that methane. Here in New

30:24.823 --> 30:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mexico, the -- basically the
entire public school system,
both at K-12 and then the higher

30:29.795 --> 30:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
educational system, is funded
from the revenues from oil and
gas royalties.

30:35.500 --> 30:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The desire to
recoup emissions has sparked
technological innovations. Jason

30:42.240 --> 30:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Libersky's company, Quantigy
Engineering, designs compressors
that vacuum vapors off

30:46.778 --> 30:49.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
storage tanks.

30:49.081 --> 30:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON LIBERSKY, CEO, Quantigy
Engineering: What we do now is
basically provide suction

30:54.319 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to these tanks that just suck
off the gases that would be
normally be released to the

30:56.988 --> 30:58.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
atmosphere.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: And so this
essentially is a vacuum cleaner?

31:00.559 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JASON LIBERSKY: Exactly, a
high-dollar vacuum cleaner.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:04.129 --> 31:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: That vacuum
can cost upwards of $50,000.
Infrared cameras can be twice

31:10.168 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that. Even this tiny control
valve has a stiff price tag for
small producers.

31:16.575 --> 31:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM MULLINS: The little item is
a $400 item, so you can see that
this items has -- there's

31:22.914 --> 31:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two of those on this particular
unit, so that's an $800 item.
Some of our marginal type wells

31:28.653 --> 31:33.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
might not make $800
profit in a year.

31:33.458 --> 31:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Oil and gas
prices are low right now. But
natural gas production

31:38.230 --> 31:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S. is on the upswing,
and is expected to grow more
than 50 percent over the next

31:43.602 --> 31:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
25 years. That means emissions
are likely to increase, too,
unless measures are taken

31:47.773 --> 31:50.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to reduce them.

31:50.308 --> 31:56.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last year, Colorado, New
Mexico's neighbor to the north,
became the first state to clamp

31:56.948 --> 32:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down on methane emissions. Now
federal rules are in the works.
Proposed EPA standards,

32:03.288 --> 32:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when combined with other federal
actions, could cut emissions
from 2012 levels by 40

32:09.461 --> 32:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to 45 percent by the year 2025
and require semi-annual
inspections of production
facilities.

32:17.102 --> 32:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Bureau of Land Management,
which oversees public lands,
mostly in the West, has drafted

32:22.307 --> 32:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new rule aimed at reducing
wasteful flaring, venting and
leaking of natural gas. But the

32:27.579 --> 32:31.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
details and timetable
aren't known yet.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Industry doesn't want
more regulation.

32:33.885 --> 32:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALLY DRANGMEISTER: A good
example might be something like
the fact that they call for

32:39.624 --> 32:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using of infrared cameras many
times a year on every well.
Well, that's something that

32:44.362 --> 32:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could cause low-producing wells
that are late in their life to
just become uneconomical

32:48.166 --> 32:53.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and have to plugged.

32:53.371 --> 32:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Environmentalists say the EPA
proposals are a good start, but
don't go far enough.

32:57.576 --> 33:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRUCE BAIZEL: It wouldn't cover
a well like this because it's --
this is an existing well.

33:01.279 --> 33:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will only cover new wells.
But you have got to get some
kind of regulation in place

33:05.116 --> 33:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the first instance, and I'm
real glad they're doing that.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Still, no
matter the method, cutting
methane emissions is a goal
shared

33:12.791 --> 33:16.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by industry, government
and environmentalists.

33:16.361 --> 33:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON GOLDSTEIN: If you are
concerned about climate change,
it's important for those
reasons.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're concerned about waste
of a natural resource, it's
important for those reasons

33:23.435 --> 33:26.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as well. It's really
a win-win issue.

33:26.104 --> 33:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: I'm Kathleen
McCleery, for the "PBS NewsHour"
in New Mexico's San

33:29.107 --> 33:33.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Juan Basin.

33:33.812 --> 33:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: the elusive
goal of peace in the Middle
East.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two decades ago, there
was a moment of hope.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
reports, the assassination

33:51.429 --> 33:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that shattered that momentum
still resonates today.

33:55.600 --> 34:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One hundred
thousand people swelled the
crowd at a Tel Aviv peace rally

34:01.206 --> 34:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
200 years ago tonight, as Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin took the
microphone to speak.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YITZHAK RABIN, Israeli Prime
Minister (through translator):
We know how to make peace, and

34:07.846 --> 34:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not just sing about peace.

34:10.215 --> 34:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But minutes
later, he was fatally gunned
down by a 27-year-old Jewish

34:14.819 --> 34:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ultra-nationalist opposed to his
peace efforts with the
Palestinians.

34:20.358 --> 34:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rabin was nearing the end of a
reelection campaign and pressing
forward with peace initiatives

34:25.063 --> 34:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on several fronts. He'd already
signed the historic Oslo accords
in Washington in 1993,

34:32.671 --> 34:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
famously shaking hands with
Yasser Arafat, head the
Palestine Liberation
Organization,

34:35.607 --> 34:37.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or PLO.

34:37.776 --> 34:42.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time, Israelis and
Palestinians agreed to
acknowledge each other's right
to

34:42.480 --> 34:44.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist.

34:44.582 --> 34:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YITZHAK RABIN: We, who have
fought against you, the
Palestinians, we say to you
today,

34:51.623 --> 34:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a loud and a clear voice,
enough of blood and tears,
enough.

34:58.964 --> 35:01.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

35:01.433 --> 35:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: A year later,
Rabin signed yet another
historic agreement, this one
with

35:06.504 --> 35:12.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
King Hussein of Jordan, to
normalize relations between the
two countries. His actions
stirred

35:12.043 --> 35:16.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a fierce backlash from
right-wing Israelis and Jewish
settlers, who saw them as steps

35:16.348 --> 35:20.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
toward forfeiting the
occupied territories.

35:20.318 --> 35:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vilification of Rabin came
despite his war hero background;
27 years a soldier, he

35:26.558 --> 35:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
began with an elite Jewish
strike force in the 1940s. And
after Israel's founding in

35:32.530 --> 35:38.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1948, he rose through the ranks
to become the military's chief
of staff.

35:38.269 --> 35:43.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rabin went on to oversee
Israel's victory in the 1967
war, winning control of
Jerusalem,

35:43.775 --> 35:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the West Bank, and Gaza. As
defense minister in 1987, he put
down the first Palestinian

35:50.315 --> 35:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intifada, instructing his troops
to use -- quote -- "force,
power, and blows."

35:56.554 --> 36:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was elected prime minister
twice, first in 1974 and then
again in 1992, campaigning

36:01.993 --> 36:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the possibility of peace.

36:04.763 --> 36:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YITZHAK RABIN: I believe that
within six to nine months, it
will be possible to reach

36:10.168 --> 36:15.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
an agreement with the
Palestinian delegation about
establishment of autonomy.

36:15.306 --> 36:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That vision was
praised at his funeral attended
by 80 heads of state,

36:21.713 --> 36:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, President Bill
Clinton, and King Hussein of

36:24.949 --> 36:27.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jordan.

36:27.318 --> 36:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HUSSEIN BIN TALAL, King of
Jordan: He had courage. He had
vision, and he had a commitment

36:32.724 --> 36:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to peace. And standing here, I
commit before you, before my
people in Jordan, before the

36:40.298 --> 36:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world, myself to continue to do
my utmost to ensure that we
leave a similar legacy.

36:51.810 --> 36:57.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But within six
months, right-wing party leader
Benjamin Netanyahu became prime

36:57.582 --> 37:02.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minister after campaigning on a
promise not to hand back
captured land to Arabs. He began

37:02.420 --> 37:07.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a second stint as prime
minister in 2009.

37:07.258 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All post-Rabin efforts to forge
peace encouraged by the United
States have foundered. Last

37:13.765 --> 37:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weekend, Israelis marked the
assassination anniversary with a
memorial rally in what

37:18.470 --> 37:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now Rabin Square in Tel Aviv.
Thousands attended, including
former Israeli President

37:23.441 --> 37:26.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Shimon Peres and former
President Clinton.

37:26.744 --> 37:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United States: The next
step will be determined by

37:30.148 --> 37:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether you decide that Yitzhak
Rabin was right, that you have
to share the future with

37:38.490 --> 37:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your neighbors, that you have to
give their children a chance,
too, that you have to stand

37:43.728 --> 37:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for peace, that the risks for
peace are not as severe as the
risk of walking away from

37:48.366 --> 37:51.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

MARGARET WARNER: But with a new
wave of Palestinian-Israeli
violence under way, it's not
clear that anyone

37:56.307 --> 37:59.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will take that risk
any time soon.

37:59.077 --> 38:02.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Margaret Warner.

38:02.547 --> 38:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We look at Rabin's
legacy today two, decades later,
with Dennis Ross, a longtime

38:08.887 --> 38:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle East peace envoy, who
served in Republican and
Democratic administrations,
Daoud Kuttab,

38:14.959 --> 38:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Palestinian journalist based
in Amman, Jordan, and Ari
Shavit, an Israeli columnist and
author.

38:20.465 --> 38:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ari Shavit, 20 years later, do
you wonder whether things could
have been different had

38:25.737 --> 38:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yitzhak Rabin not been killed?

38:28.706 --> 38:31.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARI SHAVIT, Author, "My Promised
Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of
Israel": Yes, I think

38:31.409 --> 38:34.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is a chance they would
have been different, but I think
that the romantic approach that

38:34.946 --> 38:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we would have had a perfect
ideal peace is somewhat flawed.

38:39.517 --> 38:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me say, first of all, as an
Israeli, that Rabin's murder is
a traumatic experience in

38:45.890 --> 38:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our nation's history. In the
way, it's a combination of the
murder of Abe Lincoln, John
Kennedy,

38:51.162 --> 38:54.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Martin Luther King.

38:54.699 --> 39:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rabin wasn't a saint. He wasn't
a sacred man. He had flaws. But
he had an amazing -- he

39:01.306 --> 39:07.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wasn't only courageous,
intelligent, and authentic
person, but he really tried to
end the conflict,

39:07.512 --> 39:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tragedy of the conflict. And
he represented a benign, decent,
benevolent Israel, something

39:12.750 --> 39:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we all yearn for so much today.

39:15.753 --> 39:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Daoud Kuttab, what
of that do you accept and what
do you reject?

39:19.724 --> 39:25.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAOUD KUTTAB, Palestinian
Journalist: Mr. Rabin was -- as
Ari said, was no angel. He

39:25.363 --> 39:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was the person who spoke very
toughly and acted very toughly
against the Palestinian

39:32.337 --> 39:36.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intifada. He encouraged the
soldiers to break the arms of
stone throwers.

39:36.808 --> 39:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was a very tough military
man, but he did see -- did
clearly make a conversion in his

39:44.616 --> 39:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last days, and he was really
interested in trying to find a
peaceful solution. And he

39:49.954 --> 39:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had that combination of a
security man that has been
converted and understood the
needs

39:54.225 --> 39:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a political resolution
to the conflict.

39:58.062 --> 40:05.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that sense, I think he was a
rare species that we do not see
in these days in the
negotiations

40:05.436 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
between Israelis
and Palestinians.

40:08.072 --> 40:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dennis Ross, you
wrote in an op-ed peace in The
Los Angeles Times that the last

40:13.111 --> 40:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing that Dennis -- that, I
mean, Yitzhak Rabin said to you
was, "Dennis, expect anything."

40:18.716 --> 40:22.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty years later, what did you
expect that was fulfilled and
what did you expect that

40:22.153 --> 40:24.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wasn't?

40:24.088 --> 40:28.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS ROSS, Former U.S. Envoy
to Middle East: Well, 20 years
ago, I didn't believe, A, that

40:28.559 --> 40:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he could be assassinated,
because I had a very hard time
fathoming that Yitzhak Rabin,

40:33.097 --> 40:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was the embodiment of the
Israeli experience, who fought
his whole life for Israel, was

40:38.202 --> 40:42.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
someone who could be
assassinated by an Israeli,
number one.

40:42.940 --> 40:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, had I been able to
fathom that, I wouldn't have
believed that, 20 years from

40:48.680 --> 40:53.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that moment, we would be where
we are today. I would have
believed that, somehow, even

40:53.017 --> 40:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we didn't have an agreement,
we would have found some kind of
greater basis for coexistence,

40:58.456 --> 41:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some kind of greater basis for
separation of these two peoples.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are, after all, two
national movements competing for
the same space. And I suspect

41:07.965 --> 41:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that some kind of greater basis
of stability between the two --
to be fair, I also didn't

41:14.906 --> 41:19.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expect that we would be seeing
within the Middle East as a
whole a breakdown of the

41:19.143 --> 41:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state system, Arab states
themselves being really put at
risk.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The region as a whole is not
what I expected at that point,
certainly, when I was thinking

41:26.150 --> 41:28.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back 20 years ago.

41:28.586 --> 41:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ari Shavit, as you
look back and you look forward,
do you see -- do you think

41:33.091 --> 41:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Israelis believe anymore,
just in general -- I know you
can't speak for everyone -- that

41:36.861 --> 41:39.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a two-state solution
is possible?

41:39.931 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARI SHAVIT: I think that most
Israelis still want a two-state
way. They want to move forward.

41:46.604 --> 41:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want some sort of peace.

41:50.074 --> 41:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are traumatized by the
failures of all the previous
attempts to bring about a

41:55.680 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comprehensive, complete,
idyllic, utopian peace. And in
this sense, the Rabin legacy,

42:01.252 --> 42:07.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so to speak, is really relevant,
because Rabin wasn't a utopian.
The fact that he was a general,

42:07.291 --> 42:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was tough, he was a skeptic,
he was -- he didn't come with a
kind of Mother Teresa approach

42:13.464 --> 42:18.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the conflict, that gave him a
lot of credibility within
Israel.

42:18.236 --> 42:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that would have
given him the ability to deal
much better with the conflict.

42:23.141 --> 42:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in a sense, what we need
today in Israel is a Rabin-like
of leadership, because the

42:28.479 --> 42:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right went -- became an extreme
right, and the left endured some
sort of romantic view

42:33.918 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of peace, which most
Israelis do not buy.

42:38.122 --> 42:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Daoud Kuttab, that's
a tall order that Ari Shavit
just laid out there.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the Palestinian point of
view, where is the leadership
coming from, and does it

42:47.632 --> 42:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- can it -- can it achieve what
we just heard outlined there, or
is that even something

42:52.270 --> 42:54.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you want?

42:54.238 --> 42:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAOUD KUTTAB: My generation
might still be interested in a
two-state solution, but my

42:59.644 --> 43:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
son and their generation,
they're not interested in
two-state solution.

43:03.815 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They look at us as being stupid
and being fooled by the Israelis
who kept us going for

43:11.122 --> 43:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long time, and at the same
time they were building Jewish
settlements. I mean, since

43:14.592 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rabin's death, we have had twice
or three times the size of the
Jewish settlements.

43:18.930 --> 43:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're saying there should
just be one state, and we should
find some kind of a solution

43:22.733 --> 43:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there is equal rights for
everybody. So there is a big
problem right now among

43:28.339 --> 43:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinians, in the fact that
they feel that the idea of
two-state solution was just a

43:34.512 --> 43:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
farce, and that we were giving
too many opportunities for this
idea of peace talks, and they
went

43:40.384 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nowhere. Yet we were losing
our land in the meanwhile.

43:43.721 --> 43:46.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dennis Ross, you
have been at more of these
negotiation tables than you

43:46.924 --> 43:52.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can probably count. Do you
harbor any hope or expectation
of interests converging? And

43:52.763 --> 43:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does the U.S. play a
role in that anymore?

43:56.000 --> 44:01.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS ROSS: I'm pessimistic in
the near term, because, in a
sense, what Daoud just described

44:01.939 --> 44:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a reality on the Palestinian
side in some ways is mirrored by
the Israelis side, not

44:08.946 --> 44:12.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the sense of wanting a
one-state outcome, but in the
level of disbelief that exists

44:12.116 --> 44:15.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the part of both populations.

44:15.720 --> 44:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israelis don't believe that the
Palestinians will ever accept a
two-state outcome that

44:19.290 --> 44:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accepts Israel as a state of the
Jewish people. Palestinians
don't believe that Israelis will

44:24.395 --> 44:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ever accept a genuinely
independent Palestinian state.
And the starting point has to be
change

44:29.300 --> 44:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the realities on the ground,
begin to restore a level of
belief on each side that shows

44:33.938 --> 44:37.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that a two-state outcome
actually could be possible.

44:37.241 --> 44:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the U.S. can play a
role, but I also think one of
the things that's going to have

44:41.279 --> 44:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to change, given the weakness
and dysfunction on the
Palestinian side, I think that
the

44:45.917 --> 44:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arab states are going to have to
play a different kind of role.
They're going to have to play

44:49.120 --> 44:54.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a role where they provide a kind
of cover for Palestinians to be
able to make adjustments

44:54.492 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or compromises, and they also
provide a response to the
Israelis, where the Israelis
feel,

44:59.697 --> 45:04.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they make basic compromises
or concessions towards the
Palestinians, the reciprocation

45:04.268 --> 45:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will come as much, if not more,
from the Arabs than it will come
from the Palestinians.

45:08.873 --> 45:11.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's a tall order, and,
basically, I don't think many in
the region right now are looking

45:11.976 --> 45:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the U.S. administration to be
able to manage something like
that.

45:15.079 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dennis Ross, Daoud
Kuttab, and Ari Shavit, thank
you all for sharing with

45:18.849 --> 45:23.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

45:23.421 --> 45:33.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe
you can go home again.

45:33.864 --> 45:38.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actor Jeff Daniels did it, and
even built his own professional
theater company.

45:38.135 --> 45:41.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown visited Daniels
in his Michigan hometown.

45:41.138 --> 45:43.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: He's going to insist
that, if you want the part, you
either audition together

45:43.507 --> 45:46.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or go home.

45:46.010 --> 45:50.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the new play
"Casting Session," two actors
vying for the same role,
desperate

45:50.247 --> 45:54.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for any role, await
their auditions.

45:54.285 --> 45:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The playwright is Hollywood and
Broadway actor Jeff Daniels,
who's known both the highs and

45:58.389 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lows of his profession.

46:00.858 --> 46:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS, Actor/Playwright:
I have been in this waiting room
where you're just trying

46:06.130 --> 46:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get the next gig, the next
job that pays $125 a week, and
maybe someone will come and

46:11.035 --> 46:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see it and maybe get you a
better job, but got to get this
one.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That was you?

46:15.306 --> 46:17.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF DANIELS: Oh, God,
that was me for years.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The board believes you're no
longer necessary to this
company.

46:20.745 --> 46:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At 60, Daniels is
seemingly everywhere now, with
major roles in two big

46:24.749 --> 46:27.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new movies, "Steve Jobs."

46:27.251 --> 46:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: He's going to
starve to death long before we
can help.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
"The Martian."

46:30.554 --> 46:33.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF DANIELS: Good
evening. I'm Will McAvoy.

46:33.090 --> 46:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He won an Emmy
two years ago for his starring
role as a television news

46:35.993 --> 46:38.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anchor on HBO's "The Newsroom."

JEFF DANIELS: You have
been faking for 20 years?

46:42.900 --> 46:46.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And last year, he
reprised his role in the lowbrow
comedy "Dumb and Dumber

46:46.470 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
To."

46:47.104 --> 46:49.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF DANIELS: Awesome!

46:49.840 --> 46:52.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're going to live in
Michigan in the middle of a
movie career and try to sustain

46:52.643 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it, my theory was, you
better have range.

46:55.112 --> 46:57.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You went
to Central Michigan?

46:57.915 --> 47:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early in his career, Daniels and
his wife, Kathleen, made a
decision about how they would

47:01.052 --> 47:03.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
live their lives.

47:03.220 --> 47:06.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: I knew it was a
risk. And I had come back for
three summers.

47:06.757 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A risk because
you're kind of leaving behind...

47:09.460 --> 47:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Why aren't you
moving to L.A.? What do you
mean? You're an actor.

47:11.262 --> 47:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. I mean,
you're an actor, right? You got
to be in New York or you got

47:12.563 --> 47:13.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be in L.A.

47:13.964 --> 47:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Yes. What do you
mean you're going to Michigan?
Why?

47:15.933 --> 47:18.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, it's home.

47:18.369 --> 47:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Daniels had grown
up in the small rural town of
Chelsea, Michigan, about

47:23.674 --> 47:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an hour west of Detroit. Its
major claim to fame, as home to
Jiffy mix muffins.

47:29.447 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A teacher encouraged Daniels to
act in high school plays. He
left college when he was

47:35.352 --> 47:40.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accepted into an important
apprenticeship program at the
Circle Rep Theatre in New York,

47:40.624 --> 47:44.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
renowned for fostering acting
talent and showcasing new
American plays.

47:44.428 --> 47:45.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF DANIELS: I got
to speak to you.

47:45.563 --> 47:47.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: You mean me?

47:47.264 --> 47:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He had some
success in films, including, at
age 30, in woody Allen's "Purple

47:50.935 --> 47:52.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rose of Cairo."

47:52.069 --> 47:55.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But, Daniels says:

47:55.039 --> 47:58.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: I didn't trust it.
I never trusted it. I still
don't.

47:58.008 --> 48:00.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Meaning
what? Trust...

48:00.344 --> 48:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Meaning, you're
absolutely brilliant, you're
brilliant. Oh, my God, you have
changed

48:04.348 --> 48:07.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way that actors should
act. And you start to go...

48:07.418 --> 48:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: People said that?

48:09.019 --> 48:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Well, they -- but
that -- there's no -- the
extremes.

48:10.488 --> 48:11.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right,
of course, yes.

48:11.689 --> 48:16.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: The extreme, not
only the highs, but the --
you're over, your career is
over.

48:16.594 --> 48:18.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's no consistency
there. This is consistent.

48:18.796 --> 48:21.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

48:21.165 --> 48:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the life Daniels created
by returning home to Chelsea,
raising three children here,

48:26.771 --> 48:32.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 25 years ago, building his
own purple rose, the Purple Rose
Theatre.

48:32.076 --> 48:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Initially, there
were a lot of people going, you
know, your theater won't

48:35.246 --> 48:37.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work. It just won't work.
Nobody's going to come.

48:37.982 --> 48:39.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because it can't
work in a place like this.

48:39.483 --> 48:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: It can't work.
And it's just -- forget it.

48:42.787 --> 48:45.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He renovated an
old garage that his grandfather
had once owned, and was

48:45.956 --> 48:47.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
later used for school buses.

48:47.892 --> 48:49.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF DANIELS: Wally
Grossman's (ph) bus garage.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wally Grossman.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: I remember Wally
when I was in school here. And
he would -- he was head

48:53.063 --> 48:54.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the bus drivers.

48:54.965 --> 48:57.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUY SANVILLE, Artistic Director,
Purple Rose Theatre: Across from
you is someone that hurt

48:57.234 --> 49:01.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you very badly. You have
got to forgive them.

49:01.305 --> 49:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Daniels built his
own company of actors and
technicians from nearby
communities,

49:06.577 --> 49:11.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and created a year-long
apprenticeship program to train
young people.

49:11.248 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Guy Sanville, the artistic
director here for 20 years, is
another Michigan native who left

49:16.187 --> 49:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for New York and came back.

49:19.290 --> 49:23.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUY SANVILLE: New York is a
great place. But we wanted to
raise our families here. We
wanted

49:23.427 --> 49:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to put our kids on
the bus in the morning when they
go to school. And it's just

49:27.198 --> 49:33.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- it's a little slower pace,
and -- but just as rich, I
think.

49:33.237 --> 49:38.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All fine, but to
survive, Purple Rose had to
build an audience in a small
town

49:38.742 --> 49:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with no professional theaters
and little cultural life.

49:42.413 --> 49:49.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: You have to create
that. You have to get them to
not just go to the plays

49:49.019 --> 49:55.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have a happy ending. Is it
a comedy? OK, it's not a comedy.
When's the next comedy?

49:55.392 --> 49:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, I will come to that.
And you have to get those people
to take a chance once

49:59.063 --> 49:59.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in awhile.

49:59.797 --> 50:00.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
how'd you do that?

50:00.831 --> 50:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: With comedy.

50:01.799 --> 50:03.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:03.901 --> 50:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: You got to get
them in the building. It's still
a sale. Art out here is more
often

50:09.540 --> 50:11.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than not a guy who
lives north of town.

50:11.242 --> 50:13.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But
then what happens?

50:13.210 --> 50:15.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Then they go to
see Tennessee Williams and they
-- they get their ears pinned

50:15.145 --> 50:17.348 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

50:17.348 --> 50:24.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It hasn't been
easy, but 25 years later, Purple
Rose is still here, a

50:24.588 --> 50:27.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
creative and economic
engine in the town.

50:27.691 --> 50:31.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUY SANVILLE: They used to roll
up the sidewalks at 6:00 on a
Saturday night. Well, now it's

50:31.695 --> 50:34.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
booming. And it's not just the
theater, but the theater has
been a great draw. It's a

50:34.965 --> 50:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
town of 5,000 people and we
draw 40,000 people a year.

50:36.867 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: It's the
role of a lifetime.

50:39.703 --> 50:44.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The theater
commissions new plays from
contemporary writers, and
Daniels

50:44.174 --> 50:49.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has made himself a playwright.
"Casting session" is his 16th
play written for Purple Rose.

50:49.179 --> 50:53.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: You have got a
slide thing on it. Don't --
let's keep that.

50:53.684 --> 50:57.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: He's also
developed another
Michigan-centered piece of his
artistic life,

50:57.588 --> 51:03.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as a musician and part
of a traveling band.

51:03.093 --> 51:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a family affair, including
his two sons, Ben, a guitarist,
and Luke, who serves as

51:08.666 --> 51:14.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manager. We watched the band
rehearse in a newly-built studio
on what Daniels jokingly

51:14.471 --> 51:18.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
calls the family compound.

51:18.342 --> 51:29.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next day, some 150 miles
away in Three Oaks, Michigan,
they performed at the Acorn

51:29.553 --> 51:33.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Theater, the first gig in a
month-long road tour west and
back, mostly playing in smaller

51:33.857 --> 51:42.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cities and towns.

51:42.199 --> 51:47.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Acting in major films, writing
plays, founding his own theater
company, and on the road playing

51:47.771 --> 51:54.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
music, it began with one big
decision made early on to move
back home. But nothing about

51:54.144 --> 51:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this life, says Daniels, was
the slightest bit inevitable.

51:58.082 --> 52:05.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: I remember saying
goodbye to my dad across the
lake. And I remember driving

52:05.122 --> 52:09.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the road, tears in my eyes,
because you're 21, you're from a
small town. Nobody is an

52:09.026 --> 52:12.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actor from this town.

52:12.296 --> 52:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wish I could jump in that
car and tell that 21-year-old,
look, you're going to have

52:16.700 --> 52:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some success. It's going to be
great. You're going to learn a
lot. Really not going to

52:21.205 --> 52:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen until your late 50s. So
just hang in there. Hang in
there.

52:23.974 --> 52:26.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: For about
35, 40 years, right?

52:26.877 --> 52:30.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF DANIELS: Yes. And just
be patient. Be patient.

52:30.981 --> 52:36.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Hang in there and
maybe succeed on your own terms.

52:36.520 --> 52:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Chelsea, Michigan, I'm

tonight on "NOVA" on PBS, the
first of a three-part series on

53:20.497 --> 53:26.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the geological forces that
shaped our continent. Hosted by
Kirk Johnson, the director of

America" takes a road trip
through

53:31.508 --> 53:34.344 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
our tumultuous
geological evolution.

53:34.344 --> 53:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: The landscape is
breathtaking and so much more.

53:39.917 --> 53:43.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIRK JOHNSON, National Museum of
Natural History: As a geologist,
the Grand Canyon is perhaps

53:43.654 --> 53:48.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best place in the world.
It's this incredible
300-mile-long slice through the
Earth, and

53:48.625 --> 53:55.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can see layer after layer
after layer after layer of
sedimentary rock.

53:55.365 --> 54:02.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Each layer is a time
capsule with a slice of our
continent's epic history locked

54:02.372 --> 54:04.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

to talk precision medicine.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
