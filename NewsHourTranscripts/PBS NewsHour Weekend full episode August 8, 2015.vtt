00:43.977 --> 00:44.678
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:44.678 --> 00:45.612
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.612 --> 00:46.914
THERE IS A MIX OF ANGER AND

00:46.914 --> 00:48.749
ACCEPTANCE IN COLORADO AFTER A

00:48.749 --> 00:50.717
JURY DECLINED TO SENTENCE JAMES

00:50.717 --> 00:52.586
HOLMES TO DEATH FOR HIS MASS

00:52.586 --> 00:54.154
SHOOTING INSIDE A MOVIE THEATER

00:54.154 --> 00:55.255
THREE YEARS AGO.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.124
BECAUSE THE JURY COULD NOT COME

00:57.124 --> 00:58.458
TO A UNANIMOUS DECISION TO

00:58.458 --> 01:00.260
IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY, HOLMES

01:00.260 --> 01:01.762
WILL SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE

01:01.762 --> 01:02.963
IN PRISON WITHOUT THE

01:02.963 --> 01:04.932
POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.000
HOLMES SHOT AND KILLED 12 PEOPLE

01:07.000 --> 01:09.036
AND WOUNDED 70 OTHERS DURING A

01:09.036 --> 01:10.737
MIDNIGHT PREMIERE OF THE BATMAN

01:10.737 --> 01:12.372
MOVIE "THE DARK KNIGHT RISES" IN

01:12.372 --> 01:14.841
THE DENVER SUBURB OF AURORA.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.343
ONE ANONYMOUS JUROR TOLD

01:16.343 --> 01:18.078
REPORTERS OUTSIDE COURT THE

01:18.078 --> 01:20.847
PANEL VOTED 9-3 FOR DEATH, AND

01:20.847 --> 01:22.516
THE DEFENDANT'S MENTAL ILLNESS

01:22.516 --> 01:24.318
PLAYED INTO THEIR DECISION "MORE

01:24.318 --> 01:25.752
THAN ANYTHING ELSE."

01:25.752 --> 01:27.220
>> AT THE POINT WHERE WE KNEW

01:27.220 --> 01:28.989
THAT ONE WAS AN ABSOLUTE

01:28.989 --> 01:31.091
HOLDOUT, WE ENDED THE

01:31.091 --> 01:33.093
DELIBERATIONS BECAUSE THAT

01:33.093 --> 01:35.028
PERSON WAS SOLIDLY IN FAVOR OF

01:35.028 --> 01:36.930
THE LIFE SENTENCE.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.965
>> Sreenivasan: SOME VICTIMS'

01:37.965 --> 01:39.333
FAMILIES SAY THEY ARE RELIEVED

01:39.333 --> 01:40.534
THE THREE-AND-A-HALF MONTH TRIAL

01:40.534 --> 01:41.535
IS OVER.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.936
OTHERS ARE DISAPPOINTED BY THE

01:42.936 --> 01:44.071
SENTENCE.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.005
>> WE HAVE SAID FROM THE

01:45.005 --> 01:46.073
BEGINNING THAT WE DIDN'T CARE

01:46.073 --> 01:48.075
WHAT THE VERDICT WAS AT THE END,

01:48.075 --> 01:49.943
WHETHER HE GOT LIFE OR DEATH,

01:49.943 --> 01:53.213
AND THAT STILL REMAINS TRUE.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.414
BUT I'M REALLY GLAD WE WENT

01:54.414 --> 01:55.949
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.419
>> THE GAPING WOUND THAT WE HAVE

01:59.419 --> 02:00.287
WITH THE LOSS OF OUR

02:00.287 --> 02:05.759
GRANDDAUGHTER HAS BEEN REPLACED

02:05.759 --> 02:08.862
WITH A NEW ABSCESS OF HIM

02:08.862 --> 02:10.831
LIVING.

02:10.831 --> 02:11.732
>> Sreenivasan: HOLMES COULD END

02:11.732 --> 02:13.633
UP IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY OR EVEN

02:13.633 --> 02:15.068
BE MOVED OUT OF STATE.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.303
HIS PARENTS, WHO HAD TESTIFIED

02:16.303 --> 02:18.038
TO SPARE HIS LIFE, SAID THROUGH

02:18.038 --> 02:19.906
A SPOKESWOMAN THEY ARE "SO SORRY

02:19.906 --> 02:21.541
THE VICTIMS AND FAMILIES HAVE

02:21.541 --> 02:23.477
SUFFERED SUCH TREMENDOUS LOSS."

02:23.477 --> 02:25.178
THE MASS SHOOTINGS IN AURORA,

02:25.178 --> 02:27.848
TUCSON, NEWTOWN AND OTHER CITIES

02:27.848 --> 02:29.983
HAVE NOT LED TO STRICTER

02:29.983 --> 02:32.119
NATIONAL GUN LAWS OR EVEN

02:32.119 --> 02:33.820
TOUGHER BACKGROUND CHECKS, BUT A

02:33.820 --> 02:35.622
NEW PROPOSAL MAY CHANGE THAT.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.124
TEXAS REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOHN

02:37.124 --> 02:38.492
CORNYN IS SPONSORING A BILL

02:38.492 --> 02:40.394
TO HELP STATES BETTER REPORT

02:40.394 --> 02:42.429
PEOPLE KNOWN TO BE MENTALLY ILL

02:42.429 --> 02:43.997
TO THE F.B.I. DATABASE OF

02:43.997 --> 02:45.499
INDIVIDUALS PROHIBITED FROM

02:45.499 --> 02:46.633
BUYING GUNS.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.801
JOINING ME NOW FOR MORE ON THIS

02:47.801 --> 02:49.403
DEVELOPMENT IS "WASHINGTON POST"

02:49.403 --> 02:50.570
REPORTER MIKE DEBONIS.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.140
SO, I REMEMBER AFTER IN 2013

02:53.140 --> 02:54.574
THE SORT OF GUN CONTROL

02:54.574 --> 02:56.643
LEGISLATION AFTER THE NEWTOWN

02:56.643 --> 02:58.578
MASSACRE DIDN'T GO VERY FAR.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.081
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS?

03:01.081 --> 03:02.416
>> SURE, THANKS, HARI.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.950
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.218
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS IS

03:05.218 --> 03:06.787
THAT THIS BILL HAS, AT LEAST AT

03:06.787 --> 03:08.121
THIS POINT, THE BACKING OF THE

03:08.121 --> 03:09.623
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION,

03:09.623 --> 03:11.892
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH A

03:11.892 --> 03:13.493
PREREQUISITE FOR GETTING

03:13.493 --> 03:16.997
ANYTHING RELATED TO GUNS OR

03:16.997 --> 03:19.166
BACKGROUND CHECKS OR ANYTHING

03:19.166 --> 03:20.801
RELATED TO FIREARMS THROUGH THIS

03:20.801 --> 03:22.536
REPUBLICAN CONGRESS.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.205
SO, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT THIS

03:25.205 --> 03:26.973
IS BEING SPONSORED BY AN A-PLUS

03:26.973 --> 03:30.310
RATED N.R.A. MEMBER, AND THE

03:30.310 --> 03:32.479
FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A

03:32.479 --> 03:34.981
WHOLE DIFFERENT COALITION

03:34.981 --> 03:36.183
INVOLVING MENTAL HEALTH

03:36.183 --> 03:37.684
ADVOCATES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:37.684 --> 03:39.619
WHO ARE ALSO BACKING THIS BILL,

03:39.619 --> 03:41.188
GIVES IT... MEANS THAT THIS IS

03:41.188 --> 03:42.823
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE

03:42.823 --> 03:43.924
SAW AFTER NEWTOWN.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.858
>> Sreenivasan: NOW, THERE'S A

03:44.858 --> 03:46.059
PROVISION IN HERE WHERE A JUDGE

03:46.059 --> 03:48.562
CAN IMPOSE TREATMENT ON SOMEONE

03:48.562 --> 03:51.031
WITHOUT HAVING THEM COMMITTED.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.199
I MEAN, THAT'S A DISTINCTION

03:52.199 --> 03:54.501
THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.369
>> RIGHT.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.704
WHAT SENATOR CORNYN'S BILL WOULD

03:57.704 --> 04:00.440
DO IS EXPAND WHAT'S CURRENTLY

04:00.440 --> 04:01.842
DONE IN A NUMBER OF STATES,

04:01.842 --> 04:04.377
WHEREBY FAMILY MEMBERS OR

04:04.377 --> 04:05.812
OUTSIDE PARTIES COULD PETITION A

04:05.812 --> 04:09.883
COURT TO PROVIDE VOLUNTARY

04:09.883 --> 04:11.585
TREATMENT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

04:11.585 --> 04:14.020
RATHER THAN GO AS FAR AS TO HAVE

04:14.020 --> 04:16.423
AN INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.625
THE CATCH IS THAT, UNDER THIS

04:18.625 --> 04:20.560
BILL, THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY

04:20.560 --> 04:22.462
ENTERED A VOLUNTARY MENTAL

04:22.462 --> 04:24.197
HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAM, THAT

04:24.197 --> 04:25.699
WOULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM BEING

04:25.699 --> 04:27.300
ABLE TO GO AND BUY A GUN.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.702
THE FACT WOULD REMAIN THAT YOU

04:28.702 --> 04:29.870
WOULD HAVE TO BE INVOLUNTARY

04:29.870 --> 04:32.072
COMMITTED TO BE BARRED FROM

04:32.072 --> 04:33.707
BUYING A GUN.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.775
CURRENTLY, TO GET YOUR RIGHT TO

04:35.775 --> 04:38.044
BUY A GUN BACK, YOU HAVE TO GO

04:38.044 --> 04:39.412
BEFORE A JUDGE AND PROVE THAT

04:39.412 --> 04:44.050
YOU'RE CAPABLE AND ABLE TO HAVE

04:44.050 --> 04:45.018
A FIREARM.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.286
UNDER THIS BILL, WHAT WOULD

04:46.286 --> 04:47.654
HAPPEN WOULD BE AS SOON AS THE

04:47.654 --> 04:49.189
ORDER, THE COMMITMENT ORDER

04:49.189 --> 04:51.358
EXPIRED, YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY

04:51.358 --> 04:53.226
BE ABLE TO GO AND PURCHASE A GUN

04:53.226 --> 04:54.294
AGAIN.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.529
>> Sreenivasan: SPEAKING OF

04:55.529 --> 04:56.830
PURCHASING A GUN, GUN CONTROL

04:56.830 --> 04:58.198
ADVOCATES POINT OUT THIS DOESN'T

04:58.198 --> 04:59.366
CLOSE WHAT THEY CALL THE GUN

04:59.366 --> 05:01.835
SHOW LOOPHOLE.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.969
>> RIGHT.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.171
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.639
THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE IS WHAT

05:05.639 --> 05:08.675
WAS AT ISSUE IN THE LEGISLATION

05:08.675 --> 05:10.310
THAT WAS PROPOSED AFTER NEWTOWN

05:10.310 --> 05:11.678
IN 2013.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.346
THAT'S LEGISLATION THAT THE

05:13.346 --> 05:15.448
N.R.A. INITIALLY INDICATED THEY

05:15.448 --> 05:17.617
MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT, BUT

05:17.617 --> 05:20.520
THEY WITHDREW THAT SUPPORT, AND

05:20.520 --> 05:23.890
ONLY I BELIEVE 54 SENATORS WERE

05:23.890 --> 05:26.026
ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT IN THE

05:26.026 --> 05:27.427
SENATE.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.328
NOTHING GETS DONE UNLESS YOU GET

05:28.328 --> 05:29.629
60 SENATORS.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.698
AND SINCE THEN, THE SENATE HAS

05:31.698 --> 05:33.133
GOTTEN EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.702
SO, THERE'S REALLY... IT'S

05:35.702 --> 05:37.837
PRETTY WELL KNOWN THAT THERE'S

05:37.837 --> 05:41.374
NO CHANCE FOR THE GUN SHOW

05:41.374 --> 05:43.143
BACKGROUND CHECK BILL SIMILAR TO

05:43.143 --> 05:44.945
WHAT WE SAW IN 2013 TO SUCCEED

05:44.945 --> 05:45.779
IN THIS CONGRESS.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.580
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT'S THE

05:46.580 --> 05:47.547
LIKELIHOOD OF THIS PIECE OF

05:47.547 --> 05:48.448
LEGISLATION MAKING IT TO THE

05:48.448 --> 05:49.849
FLOOR?

05:49.849 --> 05:50.884
>> WELL, IT HAS A LOT GOING FOR

05:50.884 --> 05:51.618
IT.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.253
NUMBER ONE, THE FACT THAT THE

05:53.253 --> 05:55.322
N.R.A. ISN'T OPPOSING IT.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.057
AND, IN FACT, APPEARS TO BE

05:57.057 --> 05:58.191
ENDORSING IT.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.492
NUMBER TWO, IT'S BEING SPONSORED

05:59.492 --> 06:01.828
BY JOHN CORNYN, WHO IS THE

06:01.828 --> 06:03.997
NUMBER TWO REASONING REPUBLICAN

06:03.997 --> 06:05.165
IN G.O.P. LEADERSHIP IN THE

06:05.165 --> 06:05.865
SENATE.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.701
HE'S THE MAJORITY WHIP.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.102
HE'S A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE

06:09.102 --> 06:10.403
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, WHICH WOULD

06:10.403 --> 06:11.905
HAVE TO HANDLE THIS BILL.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.707
I THINK THAT THOSE ARE BOTH

06:13.707 --> 06:15.675
THINGS THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT

06:15.675 --> 06:18.078
THIS WOULD HAVE A PRETTY, YOU

06:18.078 --> 06:20.080
KNOW, HIGH CHANCE OF LIKELIHOOD

06:20.080 --> 06:22.282
THAT IT COULD MOVE SUCCESSFULLY

06:22.282 --> 06:23.450
THROUGH THE SENATE.

06:23.450 --> 06:27.420
BUT KEEP IN MIND, WE'RE, YOU

06:27.420 --> 06:28.888
KNOW, APPROACHING AN ELECTION

06:28.888 --> 06:29.756
YEAR.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.258
WE'RE ALREADY VERY MUCH IN THE

06:31.258 --> 06:34.628
MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION DEBATE.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.996
AND THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE

06:35.996 --> 06:37.631
ELECTION, THE MORE THAT, YOU

06:37.631 --> 06:39.032
KNOW, EVEN ANYTHING ON ANY SORT

06:39.032 --> 06:40.667
OF CONTROVERSIAL MATTER CAN GET

06:40.667 --> 06:42.936
CAUGHT UP IN ANY SORT OF SIDE

06:42.936 --> 06:44.237
ISSUE AND GET SIDETRACKED.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.272
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.373
"WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER MIKE

06:46.373 --> 06:47.240
DeBONIS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

JOINING US.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.410

06:51.344 --> 06:52.412

FROM GAZIANTEP, TURKEY, WITH THE

07:29.482 --> 07:30.617
LATEST ON THE CONFLICTS.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.985
SO, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED

07:31.985 --> 07:33.086
PEOPLE THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY

07:33.086 --> 07:34.321
MISSING RIGHT NOW.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.889
ANY WORD ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

07:35.889 --> 07:37.824
THE WOMEN OR CHILDREN?

07:37.824 --> 07:38.792
I MEAN, ISIS HAS PATTERNS OF

07:38.792 --> 07:41.361
TAKING THESE PEOPLE IN THE PAST.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.228
>> WELL, THE PICTURE IS STILL

07:42.228 --> 07:43.496
VERY UNCLEAR.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.798
THE TOWN IS VERY FAR AWAY, AND

07:44.798 --> 07:46.433
WE'VE HAD EVERYBODY WATCHING

07:46.433 --> 07:47.400
THIS AND JUST SAID THE

07:47.400 --> 07:48.568
COMMUNICATIONS ARE COMPLETELY

07:48.568 --> 07:49.769
GONE WITH THE TOWNS.

07:49.769 --> 07:50.503
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET GOOD

07:50.503 --> 07:51.204
INFORMATION.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.505
YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE

07:52.505 --> 07:53.640
FLEEING FROM THE TOWNS TO OTHER

07:53.640 --> 07:54.240
AREAS.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.775
THERE HAS BEEN FIGHTING IN OTHER

07:55.775 --> 07:57.510
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SOMEWHAT

07:57.510 --> 07:58.645
NEARBY.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.281
BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE

08:01.281 --> 08:02.916
ARE SOMEWHERE AROUND 200, 230

08:02.916 --> 08:04.417
PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST OUT OF

08:04.417 --> 08:06.319
CONTACT, SO THIS HAS RAISED A

08:06.319 --> 08:08.655
LOT OF WORRIES WITH THE SYRIAN

08:08.655 --> 08:09.789
ORTHODOX CHURCH AND WITH OTHER

08:09.789 --> 08:11.424
CONFLICT MONITORS.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.726
THIS IS ONE OF THE TOWNS THAT

08:12.726 --> 08:14.127
HAS A SUBSTANTIAL CHRISTIAN

08:14.127 --> 08:16.629
POPULATION, AND NOBODY REALLY

08:16.629 --> 08:17.397
KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

08:17.397 --> 08:17.931
THEM.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.232
THERE WERE REPORTS YESTERDAY

08:19.232 --> 08:20.400
THAT SOME HAD BEEN ACTUALLY

08:20.400 --> 08:21.401
ARRESTED AND DETAINED, AND

08:21.401 --> 08:23.136
OTHERS WERE PUT UNDER A FORM OF

08:23.136 --> 08:24.437
HOUSE ARREST WHERE THE JIHADISTS

08:24.437 --> 08:26.306
WERE MAKING THEM STAY IN THEIR

08:26.306 --> 08:27.140
HOMES.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.476
THIS COULD BE BECAUSE THERE WAS

08:29.476 --> 08:30.510
SOME KIND OF RESISTANCE IN THE

08:30.510 --> 08:31.878
TOWN WHEN THEY WERE COMING IN,

08:31.878 --> 08:34.247
AND SO THE ISLAMIC STATE IS

08:34.247 --> 08:35.749
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO ARE THE

08:35.749 --> 08:36.616
FIGHTERS AND WHO ARE THE

08:36.616 --> 08:37.350
CIVILIANS.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.885
OR IT COULD BE THAT IN OTHER

08:38.885 --> 08:40.019
TIMES THEY'VE KIDNAPPED LARGE

08:40.019 --> 08:41.087
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND JUST USED

08:41.087 --> 08:42.555
THEM FOR NEGOTIATIONS, THINGS

08:42.555 --> 08:44.657
LIKE THAT.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.594
IN SYRIA, AT LEAST, ISIS HAS NOT

08:47.594 --> 08:49.863
CARRIED OUT MASS KILLINGS OF

08:49.863 --> 08:50.697
CHRISTIANS.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.699
I MEAN, THEY CERTAINLY WILL KILL

08:52.699 --> 08:54.801
MANY SHIITES OR PEOPLE FROM THE

08:54.801 --> 08:56.169
ALAWITE SECT AND OTHER SECTS

08:56.169 --> 08:57.337
THAT THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.406
BUT WE DON'T HAVE LARGE CASES OF

08:59.406 --> 09:00.907
ISIS MASSACRING CHRISTIANS, AS

09:00.907 --> 09:02.776
WE'VE SEEN THE ISIS BRANCHES IN

09:02.776 --> 09:03.977
OTHER COUNTRIES AND STUFF.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.245
BUT A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL KEEP

09:05.245 --> 09:06.780
THESE PEOPLE AND TRY TO USE THEM

09:06.780 --> 09:07.814
IN PRISONER SWAPS, THEY'LL TRY

09:07.814 --> 09:08.982
TO USE THEM TO PUT PRESSURE ON

09:08.982 --> 09:10.350
THE GOVERNMENT.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.485
BUT SO FAR WE HAVE NO

09:12.485 --> 09:15.021
INFORMATION... VERY LITTLE

09:15.021 --> 09:16.022
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FATE OF

09:16.022 --> 09:17.257
THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY

09:17.257 --> 09:18.158
INTEND TO DO WITH THEM.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.092
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHY IS

09:19.092 --> 09:20.460
THIS TOWN GEOGRAPHICALLY

09:20.460 --> 09:21.961
SIGNIFICANT?

09:21.961 --> 09:22.929
>> WELL, IT IS KIND OF A

09:22.929 --> 09:23.997
CROSSROADS TOWN.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.366
IT'S A SMALL TOWN, BUT IT JUST

09:26.366 --> 09:28.268
PUTS ISIS ONE STEP CLOSER TO

09:28.268 --> 09:30.036
SOME OTHER VERY KEY PLACES THAT

09:30.036 --> 09:31.137
ARE STILL UNDER CONTROL OF THE

09:31.137 --> 09:32.205
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.039
SO, THIS PUTS THEM A LITTLE

09:33.039 --> 09:34.207
CLOSER TO THE CITY OF HOMS,

09:34.207 --> 09:38.044
WHICH WAS A BIG BATTLE ZONE

09:38.044 --> 09:39.979
BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION THAT THE

09:39.979 --> 09:41.514
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY WON.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.916
AND SO THIS PUTS ISIS NOW ONE

09:42.916 --> 09:44.417
STEP CLOSER TO THAT.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.618
IT PUTS ISIS ONE STEP CLOSER TO

09:45.618 --> 09:47.987
SOME KEY HIGHWAYS AS WELL THAT

09:47.987 --> 09:49.522
CONNECT HOMS TO DAMASCUS AND

09:49.522 --> 09:51.024
CONNECTS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE

09:51.024 --> 09:51.758
COUNTRY.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.327
SO, THE TOWN ITSELF ISN'T, I

09:54.327 --> 09:55.595
WOULDN'T SAY, THAT STRATEGIC,

09:55.595 --> 09:56.863
BUT IT JUST PUTS THEM ONE STEP

09:56.863 --> 09:58.264
CLOSER TO SOME OTHER PLACES

09:58.264 --> 09:59.632
WHERE'S THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

09:59.632 --> 10:00.667
CAUSE MORE TROUBLE.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.634
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, BEN

10:01.634 --> 10:02.635
HUBBARD FROM "NEW YORK TIMES,"

10:02.635 --> 10:03.603
JOINING US VIA SKYPE FROM

10:03.603 --> 10:04.737
GAZIANTEP, TURKEY.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.905
THANKS SO MUCH.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.307
>> THANK YOU.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.174
>> Sreenivasan: THE U.S. NAVY IS

10:08.174 --> 10:09.409
PLANNING TO POST ARMED GUARDS AT

10:09.409 --> 10:10.443
SOME RESERVE CENTERS.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.711
THE GUARDS WILL BE POSTED ONLY

10:11.711 --> 10:12.979
AT THE 70 RESERVE CENTERS WITH

10:12.979 --> 10:14.180
PUBLIC ACCESS.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.148
BUT THE NAVY WILL

10:15.148 --> 10:16.382
NOT POST ARMED GUARDS AT

10:16.382 --> 10:17.417
RECRUITING CENTERS.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.485
THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE FATAL

10:18.485 --> 10:19.719
SHOOTING OF FIVE UNARMED

10:19.719 --> 10:21.187
SERVICEMEN AT A CHATTANOOGA,

10:21.187 --> 10:22.455
TENNESSEE, RESERVE CENTER LAST

10:22.455 --> 10:23.156
MONTH.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.390
THE NEW GUARDS ARE EXPECTED TO

10:24.390 --> 10:25.725
BE IN PLACE BY MID-OCTOBER.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.327
THE NAVY IS THE FIRST BRANCH OF

10:27.327 --> 10:28.728
THE U.S. MILITARY TO ANNOUNCE

10:28.728 --> 10:30.497
THAT IT WILL GUARD ITS OFF-BASE

10:30.497 --> 10:31.698
FACILITIES.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.199
THE E.P.A. IS CLEANING UP AND

10:33.199 --> 10:35.235
APOLOGIZING FOR AN ONGOING TOXIC

10:35.235 --> 10:37.570
SPILL IN A COLORADO RIVER.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.838
THE ANIMAS RIVER, IN THE

10:38.838 --> 10:39.973
SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE STATE,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.741
HAS FILLED WITH A SOUPY, ORANGE-

10:41.741 --> 10:42.909
COLORED FLUID.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.544
THE PROBLEM BEGAN WEDNESDAY WHEN

10:44.544 --> 10:46.646
AN E.P.A. CREW CLEANING UP AN

10:46.646 --> 10:48.848
INACTIVE GOLD MINE ACCIDENTALLY

10:48.848 --> 10:51.117
CAUSED A MILLION GALLONS OF

10:51.117 --> 10:52.685
WASTEWATER TO FLOW INTO A CREEK

10:52.685 --> 10:54.254
THAT CONNECTS TO THE RIVER.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.722
TODAY, THE MINE WAS STILL

10:55.722 --> 10:57.657
DISCHARGING WATER CONTAMINATED

10:57.657 --> 10:59.826
WITH ARSENIC, LEAD, ALUMINUM AND

10:59.826 --> 11:00.827
COPPER.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.428
THE E.P.A. IS WARNING PEOPLE AND

11:02.428 --> 11:04.063
PETS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE RIVER

11:04.063 --> 11:06.065
AS THE SPILL HEADS DOWNSTREAM

11:06.065 --> 11:08.835
TOWARD NEW MEXICO AND UTAH.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.069
OFFICIALS HAVE RELEASED CLEAN

11:10.069 --> 11:11.604
WATER FROM A NEARBY DAM TO

11:11.604 --> 11:13.339
DILUTE THE METALS IN THE RIVER,

11:13.339 --> 11:14.541

11:14.541 --> 11:16.576
RETENTION POND TO REDIRECT

11:16.576 --> 11:18.111
POLLUTED WATER.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.779
AMERICAN SWIMMER KATIE LEDECKY

11:19.779 --> 11:22.615
HAS WON HER FOURTH INDIVIDUAL

LONG BEFORE THE INEVITABLE

12:04.991 --> 12:06.259
HAPPENS.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.427
THE IDEA IS TO ENCOURAGE

12:56.476 --> 12:58.177
THAT WAS THEN.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.837
DECISIONS IF YOU'RE

14:30.837 --> 14:32.672
INCAPACITATED.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.073
THE MEDICARE PLAN WILL LIKELY

14:34.073 --> 14:36.109
TAKE EFFECT IN JANUARY, BUT

14:36.109 --> 14:37.243
HOLDING SUCH PRIVATE

14:37.243 --> 14:38.611
CONVERSATIONS IN THE PUBLIC

14:38.611 --> 14:40.613
ARENA MAY REQUIRE A NEW

14:40.613 --> 14:42.482
APPROACH, AS ADVOCATES IN

14:42.482 --> 14:44.584
MASSACHUSETTS HAVE LEARNED.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.718
>> SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK YOU

14:45.718 --> 14:47.086
TALK ABOUT DYING AND YOU LET IT

14:47.086 --> 14:48.154
INTO THE ROOM.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.689
(LAUGHS)

14:49.689 --> 14:50.523
>> Reporter: PULITZER PRIZE-

14:50.523 --> 14:51.991
WINNING JOURNALIST ELLEN GOODMAN

14:51.991 --> 14:53.726
IS ON A MISSION TO MAKE DEATH

14:53.726 --> 14:55.762
PART OF POPULAR CONVERSATION.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.364
FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS, SHE

14:58.364 --> 14:59.932
CHRONICLED AMERICAN SOCIAL

14:59.932 --> 15:01.734
CHANGE IN HER WIDELY SYNDICATED

15:01.734 --> 15:03.936
COLUMNS FOR THE "BOSTON GLOBE."

15:03.936 --> 15:05.404
SHE WROTE ABOUT THE VALUES

15:05.404 --> 15:07.473
INSTILLED IN HER AS A CHILD BY

15:07.473 --> 15:09.242
HER FATHER, WHO HELPED RUN JOHN

15:09.242 --> 15:10.376
F. KENNEDY'S FIRST SENATE

15:10.376 --> 15:12.345
CAMPAIGN, AND HER HOMEMAKER

15:12.345 --> 15:13.780
MOTHER, EDITH.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.815
BUT GOODMAN ONLY REALIZED THE

15:15.815 --> 15:17.550
CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING CERTAIN

15:17.550 --> 15:19.452
THINGS UNSAID ABOUT A DOZEN

15:19.452 --> 15:21.187
YEARS AGO, WHEN HER MOTHER'S

15:21.187 --> 15:22.922
HEALTH STARTED TO FAIL.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.157
>> I THINK WE ALL HAVE THIS

15:24.157 --> 15:26.092
FANTASY THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIVE

15:26.092 --> 15:28.494
TO 90 AND THEN, KABOOM, YOU

15:28.494 --> 15:29.529
KNOW?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.564
BUT, IN FACT, THE REALITY IS

15:31.564 --> 15:33.399
THAT MANY OF US WILL FACE A LONG

15:33.399 --> 15:35.368
PERIOD OF BEING FRAIL AND

15:35.368 --> 15:36.903
DECLINING.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.638
AND I WOULD SAY THAT MY MOTHER

15:38.638 --> 15:41.073
BEGAN TO DECLINE SOMEWHERE IN

15:41.073 --> 15:43.276
HER 80s, REALLY.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.977
>> Reporter: AFTER HER MOTHER

15:44.977 --> 15:46.546
MOVED TO A LONG-TERM CARE

15:46.546 --> 15:48.047
FACILITY A FEW MILES AWAY,

15:48.047 --> 15:49.816
GOODMAN FOUND HERSELF MAKING

15:49.816 --> 15:51.651
MEDICAL DECISIONS SHE HADN'T

15:51.651 --> 15:53.820
DREAMED OF, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

15:53.820 --> 15:55.788
EDITH BEGAN TO SUFFER FROM

15:55.788 --> 15:56.989
DEMENTIA.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.157
>> MY MOTHER COULD REALLY NO

15:58.157 --> 15:59.225
LONGER DECIDE WHAT SHE WANTED

15:59.225 --> 16:00.726
FOR LUNCH, LET ALONE WHAT SHE

16:00.726 --> 16:02.595
WANTED FOR HER HEALTH CARE

16:02.595 --> 16:03.930
DECISIONS.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.966
SO, I WAS FACED WITH A KIND OF

16:06.966 --> 16:08.267
CASCADING NUMBER OF DECISIONS

16:08.267 --> 16:11.137
FOR WHICH I WAS UNPREPARED.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.005
IN FACT, BLINDSIDED.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.441
AND I REMEMBER PARTICULARLY ONE

16:15.441 --> 16:17.343
DAY WHEN I GOT A CALL ON THE

16:17.343 --> 16:19.846
PHONE AND I WAS ON DEADLINE.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.582
AND THE DOCTOR SAID TO ME, "YOUR

16:22.582 --> 16:24.150
MOTHER HAS ANOTHER BOUT OF

16:24.150 --> 16:25.484
PNEUMONIA.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.886
DO YOU WANT HER TO HAVE

16:26.886 --> 16:28.254
ANTIBIOTICS?"

16:28.254 --> 16:29.856
AND I REMEMBER MY HANDS BEING

16:29.856 --> 16:31.190
POISED OVER THE KEYBOARD,

16:31.190 --> 16:33.793
SAYING, "WHAT IS HE ASKING ME?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.328
IS HE ASKING ME, DO I WANT HER

16:35.328 --> 16:36.729
TO LIVE OR DIE?"

16:36.729 --> 16:38.564
YOU KNOW, "CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

16:38.564 --> 16:40.666
COULD I HAVE A MINUTE?"

16:40.666 --> 16:43.836
AND SO, IT WAS QUITE SHOCKING TO

16:43.836 --> 16:45.938
ME THAT THOSE DECISIONS FELL TO

16:45.938 --> 16:46.639
ME.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.907
I'D JUST NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

16:47.907 --> 16:48.708
>> Reporter: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

16:48.708 --> 16:50.109
IS, YOU NEVER TALKED TO HER

16:50.109 --> 16:51.377
ABOUT THESE THINGS AHEAD OF

16:51.377 --> 16:52.211
TIME?

16:52.211 --> 16:54.080
>> WELL, WE DIDN'T TALK IN A WAY

16:54.080 --> 16:56.015
THAT WAS USEFUL.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.183
FROM TIME TO TIME, IF WE WERE

16:57.183 --> 16:58.251
TOGETHER, MY MOTHER WOULD SAY,

16:58.251 --> 17:00.019
"I NEVER WANT TO BE LIKE THAT,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.888
PULL THE PLUG," YOU KNOW.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.155
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.857
WELL, THERE'S GENERALLY NO PLUG

17:04.857 --> 17:06.225
TO PULL.

"WHAT MATTERS TO ME AT THE END

OF LIFE IS?"

17:58.577 --> 18:00.880
AND THERE ARE EVEN SOME ACTUAL

18:00.880 --> 18:03.316
WORDS THAT ARE SUGGESTED TO

18:03.316 --> 18:05.051
HELP YOU BREAK THE ICE.

THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE, WILL YOU

18:09.188 --> 18:10.556
HELP ME?"

18:10.556 --> 18:13.059
>> WE TALKED ABOUT NURSING HOMES

18:13.059 --> 18:16.028
AND, YOU KNOW, LIVING AT HOME.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.897
WE TALKED ABOUT PAIN MANAGEMENT.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.465
WE TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF

18:19.465 --> 18:23.336
ISSUES THAT WE WOULDN'T

18:23.336 --> 18:25.071

LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS,

18:30.676 --> 18:32.611

18:45.658 --> 18:47.360
THEIR LIVING ROOM.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.894
THEY WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT

18:48.894 --> 18:50.730
THE EFFECT ON SARAH.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.064
>> I COULD JUST TELL I WAS

18:52.064 --> 18:53.566
UNSETTLING HER, AND THAT WAS

18:53.566 --> 18:55.668
VERY DIFFICULT.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.902
>> I'M 32.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.237
I HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.106
LIKE, I'M AN ADULT, AND I KNOW

19:00.106 --> 19:01.307
THAT.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.708
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME

19:02.708 --> 19:05.144
INTERACTING WITH MY PARENTS, I'M

19:05.144 --> 19:07.480
THEIR CHILD; I'M NOT THEIR

19:07.480 --> 19:08.781
CARETAKER.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.850
AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THAT

19:10.850 --> 19:12.184
EVENTUAL ROLE REVERSAL IS VERY

19:12.184 --> 19:13.119
SCARY.

CONVERSATION, YOUR FIRST

19:16.889 --> 19:18.391
REACTION WAS?

19:18.391 --> 19:20.259
>> I WAS HAPPY THAT THEY WERE

19:20.259 --> 19:22.128
SUGGESTING IT BECAUSE IT'S

19:22.128 --> 19:23.229
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE WANTED TO

19:23.229 --> 19:24.964
TALK TO THEM ABOUT, BUT I DIDN'T

19:24.964 --> 19:26.565
REALLY HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW TO

19:26.565 --> 19:27.833
BRING IT UP.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.868
>> Reporter: SARAH SAYS SHE WAS

19:28.868 --> 19:30.169
ESPECIALLY RELIEVED WHEN THEY

19:30.169 --> 19:31.437
SAID THAT MOVING THEM TO

19:31.437 --> 19:33.105
MARYLAND, WHERE SHE LIVES, FOR

19:33.105 --> 19:35.074
LONG-TERM CARE WOULD BE

19:35.074 --> 19:36.475
ACCEPTABLE.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.177
WAS THIS ABOUT GAINING CONTROL

19:38.177 --> 19:40.079
OVER THE END OF YOUR OWN LIFE?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.480
>> YEAH, I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT

19:41.480 --> 19:43.282
KIND OF GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT OF

19:43.282 --> 19:45.317
A SENSE OF CONTROL, A CERTAIN

19:45.317 --> 19:46.685
STARTING TO THINK ABOUT IT.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.920
>> YEAH, ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS

19:47.920 --> 19:49.255
WOULD BE THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT

19:49.255 --> 19:50.489
I'D BE IN PAIN, OR MAYBE I

19:50.489 --> 19:52.124
WASN'T SO CLEARHEADED AND THE

19:52.124 --> 19:53.059
DOCTORS WOULD BE MAKING

19:53.059 --> 19:54.226
DECISIONS ON WHAT MY TREATMENT

WOULD BE.

PEOPLE AGREE, SAYING THEY SHOULD

20:06.806 --> 20:08.407
HAVE THE CONVERSATION.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.609
BUT ONLY 30% HAVE DONE SO, WHICH

20:10.609 --> 20:12.645

21:05.764 --> 21:07.933
NOTHING WILL CHANGE UNTIL PEOPLE

21:07.933 --> 21:09.702

21:16.408 --> 21:17.776
MY DAUGHTER'S A COMEDIAN, AND

21:17.776 --> 21:20.212
HER FIRST RESPONSE WHEN I SAID,

21:20.212 --> 21:22.681
"LET'S HAVE THIS CONVERSATION,"

21:22.681 --> 21:23.749
WAS, "CAN'T WE HAVE LUNCH?"

21:23.749 --> 21:25.718
(LAUGHS)

21:25.718 --> 21:27.586
BUT WE DID GET THROUGH IT.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.054
WE DID TALK ABOUT IT.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.524
AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH

21:31.524 --> 21:33.592
MY HUSBAND AND WITH MOST OF THE
