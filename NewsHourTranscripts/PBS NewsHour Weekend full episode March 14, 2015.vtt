00:51.852 --> 00:53.186
VIOLENCE AND RACIAL TENSION

01:05.999 --> 01:07.701
ON WEDNESDAY, ROBINSON'S MOTHER

01:07.701 --> 01:09.036
HAD THIS TO SAY:

01:09.036 --> 01:10.070
>> I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A

01:10.070 --> 01:11.004
CHANGE.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.606
I DON'T WANT MY SON TO HAVE DIED

01:12.606 --> 01:14.408
IN VAIN.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.409
I WANT US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:15.409 --> 01:17.644
CHANGE AND DO IT PEACEFULLY.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.412
>> Sreenivasan: A PRELIMINARY

01:18.412 --> 01:19.846
REPORT RELEASED YESTERDAY

01:19.846 --> 01:21.515
REVEALED ROBINSON HAD BEEN SHOT

01:21.515 --> 01:23.650
IN THE HEAD, TORSO AND UPPER

01:23.650 --> 01:24.418
BODY.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.619
THE ROBINSON SHOOTING IGNITED

01:25.619 --> 01:27.020
DAYS OF PROTESTS AND IS STILL

01:27.020 --> 01:28.322
BEING INVESTIGATED BY STATE

01:28.322 --> 01:30.791
AUTHORITIES.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.792
AND IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI, THE

01:31.792 --> 01:32.893
MANHUNT CONTINUES FOR THE

01:32.893 --> 01:34.261
SUSPECTS WHO SHOT AND WOUNDED

01:34.261 --> 01:35.963
TWO OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE POLICE

01:35.963 --> 01:37.631
DEPARTMENT ON WEDNESDAY.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.433
IT'S JUST THE LATEST INCIDENCE

01:39.433 --> 01:40.867
OF VIOLENCE SINCE THE POLICE

01:40.867 --> 01:42.235
SHOOTING OF MICHAEL BROWN ON

01:42.235 --> 01:43.437
AUGUST 9.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
THIS WEEK, FOLLOWING A SCATHING

01:44.805 --> 01:46.640
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REPORT ABOUT

01:46.640 --> 01:48.108
RACISM WITHIN THE FERGUSON

01:48.108 --> 01:49.543
POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE CITY'S

01:49.543 --> 01:50.911
MANAGER, POLICE CHIEF AND

01:50.911 --> 01:52.679
MUNICIPAL JUDGE ALL RESIGNED

01:52.679 --> 01:54.648
THEIR POSITIONS WITHIN THE CITY.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.916
BUT SO FAR, THE MAYOR OF

01:55.916 --> 01:57.751
FERGUSON, JAMES KNOWLES, REFUSES

01:57.751 --> 01:58.618
TO STEP DOWN.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.053
KNOWLES SAYS HE WANTS TO "TURN

02:00.053 --> 02:02.522
THE CITY AROUND," BUT HE ALSO

02:02.522 --> 02:05.525
TOLD "USA TODAY": "I HAVE NO

02:05.525 --> 02:06.426
EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY.

02:06.426 --> 02:07.427
I HAVE NO ADMINISTRATIVE

02:07.427 --> 02:07.928
AUTHORITY.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.563
THE CHARTER DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO

02:09.563 --> 02:11.431
HIRE, FIRE OR EVEN GIVE

02:11.431 --> 02:13.567
DIRECTION TO CITY EMPLOYEES."

02:13.567 --> 02:15.068
JOINING US NOW FROM ST. LOUIS IS

02:15.068 --> 02:16.169
JIM SALTER OF THE ASSOCIATED

02:16.169 --> 02:16.570
PRESS.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.537
HE'S BEEN COVERING THE STORY

02:17.537 --> 02:18.305
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.539
SO, LET'S BEGIN WITH THAT

02:19.539 --> 02:20.907
STATEMENT.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.776
IS THERE NO ONE THAT HAS ANY

02:22.776 --> 02:24.911
LEADERSHIP CAPACITY IN FERGUSON,

02:24.911 --> 02:26.346
IF THIS IS THE JOB DESCRIPTION

02:26.346 --> 02:28.382
THAT THE MAYOR SAYS?

02:28.382 --> 02:30.083
>> THERE'S AN ACTING CITY

02:30.083 --> 02:30.784
MANAGER; THE ASSISTANT CITY

02:30.784 --> 02:32.119
MANAGER HAS BEEN PROMOTED TO THE

02:32.119 --> 02:33.220
POSITION NOW THAT JOHN SHAW

02:33.220 --> 02:34.588
STEPPED DOWN.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.188
THE MAYOR'S RIGHT.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.557
HE'S... IN A SENSE, THE MAYOR,

02:37.557 --> 02:39.593
CITY MANAGER, FORM OF GOVERNMENT

02:39.593 --> 02:41.928
LIKE FERGUSON, IS A CEREMONIAL

02:41.928 --> 02:43.597
FIGUREHEAD.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.498
HE DOES RUN THE COUNCIL

02:44.498 --> 02:45.899
MEETINGS, BUT IT'S A PART-TIME

02:45.899 --> 02:48.335
POSITION; HE MAKES ABOUT $4,200

02:48.335 --> 02:49.569
A YEAR.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.671
AND UNTIL THIS WHOLE CRISIS

02:51.671 --> 02:53.273
BROKE, HIS ROLE WAS REALLY TO

02:53.273 --> 02:54.508
LEAD CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND

02:54.508 --> 02:56.910
TO SHAKE HANDS AND TO BE SORT OF

02:56.910 --> 02:58.879
THE FACE OF THE CITY.

02:58.879 --> 02:59.746
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT'S YOUR

02:59.746 --> 03:01.648
SENSE, THEN, OF THE TENSION

03:01.648 --> 03:04.317
BETWEEN DIFFERENT SIDES OVER

03:04.317 --> 03:05.752
JUST THE PAST FEW MONTHS, AND

03:05.752 --> 03:07.087
WHETHER IT'S GOTTEN WORSE WITH

03:07.087 --> 03:08.055
WHAT HAPPENED JUST A FEW DAYS

03:08.055 --> 03:09.589
AGO?

03:09.589 --> 03:11.091
>> I BELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN BETTER

03:11.091 --> 03:12.459
BECAUSE THE CITY HAS TAKEN

03:12.459 --> 03:14.628
PRETTY SWIFT ACTION.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.696
SIX DIFFERENT PRETTY KEY FIGURES

03:16.696 --> 03:19.066
HAVE LEFT THE CITY, AS YOU

03:19.066 --> 03:20.434
MENTIONED, IN THE PAST... REALLY

03:20.434 --> 03:22.135
IN THE PAST WEEK, INCLUDING THE

03:22.135 --> 03:24.171
CITY MANAGER, THE POLICE CHIEF,

03:24.171 --> 03:25.439
THE MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE AND

03:25.439 --> 03:27.874
THE MUNICIPAL COURT CLERK, AND

03:27.874 --> 03:28.842
TWO POLICE OFFICERS, THE OTHER

03:28.842 --> 03:30.010
TWO.

03:30.010 --> 03:30.944
THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO

03:30.944 --> 03:31.645
AREN'T SATISFIED.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.479
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE MAYOR

03:32.479 --> 03:34.081
SHOULD GO, THAT EVEN MEMBERS OF

03:34.081 --> 03:35.382
THE COUNCIL SHOULD GO.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.150
AND THE MAYOR'S ARGUMENT, OF

03:37.150 --> 03:38.652
COURSE, IS THAT AS A PART-TIME

03:38.652 --> 03:41.254
CEREMONIAL FIGURE, A CITY

03:41.254 --> 03:42.589
COUNCIL LEADER, HE'S REALLY NOT

03:42.589 --> 03:43.757
PRIVY TO THE INFORMATION THAT

03:43.757 --> 03:45.892
THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE HE WAS

03:45.892 --> 03:46.927
PRIVY TO.

03:46.927 --> 03:47.661
>> Sreenivasan: SO, AT THE

03:47.661 --> 03:49.296
MOMENT, WHEN IT COMES TO LAW

03:49.296 --> 03:51.398
ENFORCEMENT, WHO'S IN CHARGE?

03:51.398 --> 03:52.265
IS IT THE CITY POLICE?

03:52.265 --> 03:53.200
IS IT THE STATE POLICE?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.068
THE COUNTY POLICE?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.269
>> WELL, IN TERMS OF DAY-TO-DAY

03:56.269 --> 03:57.270
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FERGUSON,

03:57.270 --> 03:59.005
IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CITY POLICE.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.974
THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTIONS WHO

04:00.974 --> 04:02.175
WANT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO BE

04:02.175 --> 04:03.210
DISSOLVED.

04:03.210 --> 04:03.977
THEY WANT ST. LOUIS COUNTY TO

04:03.977 --> 04:05.178
TAKE OVER, OR A NEIGHBORING

04:05.178 --> 04:06.680
COMMUNITY TO TAKE OVER PATROL IN

04:06.680 --> 04:08.215
FERGUSON.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.684
THE MAYOR HAS BEEN STEADFAST IN

04:10.684 --> 04:12.552
THAT THE CITIZENS OF THE TOWN DO

04:12.552 --> 04:13.487
NOT WANT THAT.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.488
HE BELIEVES THAT THE CITIZENS

04:14.488 --> 04:16.123
WANT THEIR OWN POLICE FORCE.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.657
THEY WANT CHANGE, BUT THEY DON'T

04:17.657 --> 04:18.992
WANT ANOTHER ENTITY TO COME IN

04:18.992 --> 04:20.193
AND TAKE OVER.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.796
NOW, IN TERMS OF SECURITY DURING

04:22.796 --> 04:24.664
THE PROTEST, YES, THERE HAS BEEN

04:24.664 --> 04:25.298
A CHANGE.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.199
ST. LOUIS COUNTY AND THE

04:26.199 --> 04:27.834
MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL

04:27.834 --> 04:29.536
HAVE TAKEN OVER THAT DUTY, AT

04:29.536 --> 04:30.804
LEAST FOR NOW, ALTHOUGH THINGS

04:30.804 --> 04:32.405
WERE VERY QUIET THE PAST TWO

04:32.405 --> 04:32.806
NIGHTS.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.341
IN FACT, VIRTUALLY NO PROTESTERS

04:34.341 --> 04:35.108
LAST NIGHT.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.543
SO, THAT COULD CHANGE.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.178
BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, FERGUSON IS

04:38.178 --> 04:39.012
RUNNING ITS OWN POLICE

04:39.012 --> 04:40.113
DEPARTMENT, BUT IT IS DEFERRING

04:40.113 --> 04:41.615
TO ST. LOUIS COUNTY AND THE

04:41.615 --> 04:44.117
HIGHWAY PATROL FOR PROTEST DUTY.

04:44.117 --> 04:44.885
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, JAMES

04:44.885 --> 04:46.086
SALTER OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,

04:46.086 --> 04:47.420
JOINING US FROM ST. LOUIS.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.655
THANKS SO MUCH.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.390
>> MY PLEASURE.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.691
>> Sreenivasan: THERE ARE NEW

04:51.691 --> 04:52.893
DETAILS IN THE CONTROVERSY OVER

04:52.893 --> 04:54.127
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE

04:54.127 --> 04:55.362
HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL

04:55.362 --> 04:56.163
PRACTICES.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.531
THIS WEEK, CLINTON CONFIRMED SHE

04:57.531 --> 04:59.065
USED A PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT

04:59.065 --> 05:00.400
FOR OFFICIAL BUSINESS BUT

05:00.400 --> 05:01.868
EMPHASIZED THE MESSAGES WERE

05:01.868 --> 05:03.870
PRESERVED ON GOVERNMENT SERVERS.

05:03.870 --> 05:04.905
BUT NOW, THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS

05:04.905 --> 05:06.506
SAYING IT HAD NO WAY OF

05:06.506 --> 05:08.241
ROUTINELY PRESERVING EMAILS FROM

05:08.241 --> 05:09.709
SENIOR OFFICIALS DURING

05:09.709 --> 05:10.610
CLINTON'S TIME WITH THE

05:10.610 --> 05:11.278
DEPARTMENT.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.112
IN FACT, OFFICIALS SAY THEY

05:12.112 --> 05:14.181
DEPENDED ON INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES

05:14.181 --> 05:15.782
TO DECIDE IF CERTAIN EMAILS

05:15.782 --> 05:17.317
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED "PUBLIC

05:17.317 --> 05:18.218
RECORDS."

05:18.218 --> 05:19.719
CLINTON SAYS SHE HAS TURNED OVER

05:19.719 --> 05:21.555
HER WORK-RELATED EMAILS TO STATE

05:21.555 --> 05:23.056
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS BUT SAYS

05:23.056 --> 05:24.357
SHE WILL NOT TURN OVER PERSONAL

05:24.357 --> 05:25.458
MESSAGES.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.893
A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT MILLIONS

05:26.893 --> 05:28.728
OF DEATH RECORDS ARE MISSING

05:28.728 --> 05:29.930
FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY

05:29.930 --> 05:30.964
DATABASE.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.165
ACCORDING TO THE AGENCY'S

05:32.165 --> 05:33.333
INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOCIAL

05:33.333 --> 05:36.069
SECURITY RECORDS SHOW 6.5

05:36.069 --> 05:37.938
MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. HAVE

05:37.938 --> 05:40.974
REACHED AGE 112 OR OLDER.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.709
THE DATA LAPSE MEANS MILLIONS OF

05:42.709 --> 05:44.578
LONG-DECEASED AMERICANS STILL

05:44.578 --> 05:46.246
HAVE ACTIVE SOCIAL SECURITY

05:46.246 --> 05:47.781
NUMBERS, SO THIEVES COULD USE

05:47.781 --> 05:49.683
THEIR ACCOUNTS TO REPORT WAGES,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.017
OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS, GET CREDIT

05:51.017 --> 05:53.019
CARDS OR FAKE TAX PAPERS.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.321
THE AGENCY SAYS IT IS WORKING TO

05:54.321 --> 05:56.022
UPDATE THE SYSTEM BUT WARNS IT

05:56.022 --> 05:57.724
WILL BE COSTLY AND TIME-

05:57.724 --> 05:59.526
CONSUMING TO DO SO.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.594
CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS SAY THEY

06:00.594 --> 06:03.230
HAVE ISSUED ABOUT 131,000

06:03.230 --> 06:04.564
DRIVER'S LICENSES TO

06:04.564 --> 06:05.999
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE

06:05.999 --> 06:06.866
LAST TWO MONTHS.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.468
CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF TEN STATES

06:08.468 --> 06:09.569
AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

06:09.569 --> 06:11.371
WHICH HAS DRAWN CRITICISM FOR

06:11.371 --> 06:13.073
GRANTING DRIVER'S LICENSES

06:13.073 --> 06:14.608
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION

06:14.608 --> 06:15.442
STATUS.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.876
IN FRANCE, PROSECUTORS HAVE

06:16.876 --> 06:18.511
INDICTED TWO MEN IN CONNECTION

06:18.511 --> 06:19.779
WITH THE TERROR ATTACK ON A

06:19.779 --> 06:21.448
KOSHER SUPERMARKET IN PARIS IN

06:21.448 --> 06:22.315
JANUARY.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.683
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY HAVE TIED

06:23.683 --> 06:25.885
A 25-YEAR-OLD AND A 33-YEAR-OLD

06:25.885 --> 06:27.320
TO THE ATTACK ON THE MARKET AND

06:27.320 --> 06:29.089
THE SATIRICAL MAGAZINE "CHARLIE

06:29.089 --> 06:31.324
HEBDO" THROUGH HUNDREDS OF TEXT

06:31.324 --> 06:33.426
MESSAGES, MEETINGS AND D.N.A.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.795
FOUND AT THE CRIME SCENE.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.163
ONE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN'S MOST

06:37.163 --> 06:38.965
POWERFUL STORMS HAS KILLED AT

06:38.965 --> 06:40.300
LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE AND FORCED

06:40.300 --> 06:41.935
HUNDREDS INTO SHELTERS ACROSS

06:41.935 --> 06:44.738
THE VANUATU CHAIN OF ISLANDS.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.107
PAM, A CATEGORY-FIVE CYCLONE,

06:47.107 --> 06:48.475
HIT THE TINY SOUTH PACIFIC

06:48.475 --> 06:49.743
NATION EARLY THIS MORNING,

06:49.743 --> 06:51.778
PACKING WIND GUSTS UP TO 200

06:51.778 --> 06:53.213
MILES PER HOUR.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.749
UNICEF ESTIMATES 54,000 CHILDREN

06:55.749 --> 06:56.883
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE

06:56.883 --> 06:57.651
CYCLONE.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.818
THE STORM IS EXPECTED TO SKIM

06:58.818 --> 07:00.687
THE NORTHERN COAST OF NEW

07:00.687 --> 07:14.668
ZEALAND TOMORROW INTO MONDAY.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.835
>> Sreenivasan: THIS WEEK COULD

07:15.835 --> 07:17.404
BE A TURNING POINT IN IRAQ'S

07:17.404 --> 07:19.673
FIGHT AGAINST ISIS MILITANTS.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.041
SHIA MILITIA MEMBERS HAVE JOINED

07:21.041 --> 07:22.842
IRAQI FORCES TO TAKE BACK

07:22.842 --> 07:23.843
TIKRIT.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.312
IF THEY SUCCEED, IT WOULD BE THE

07:25.312 --> 07:26.980
FIRST TIME PRO-GOVERNMENT FORCES

07:26.980 --> 07:28.848
BEAT BACK ISIS TO RECOVER A

07:28.848 --> 07:30.317
MAJOR IRAQI CITY.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.418
YESTERDAY, THE FIGHTING

07:31.418 --> 07:33.186
REPORTEDLY STALLED WHILE TROOPS

07:33.186 --> 07:35.121
WAITED FOR REINFORCEMENTS.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.856
BUT NOW, A U.S. MILITARY LEADER

07:36.856 --> 07:38.291
SAYS HE'S WORRIED ABOUT WHAT

07:38.291 --> 07:39.993
COULD HAPPEN NEXT IF IRAQI

07:39.993 --> 07:41.795
TROOPS MANAGE TO DEFEAT ISIS

07:41.795 --> 07:42.796
ALTOGETHER.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.797
FOR SOME INSIGHT, WE'RE JOINED

07:43.797 --> 07:45.332
NOW FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. BY

07:45.332 --> 07:46.266
DOUGLAS OLLIVANT, FORMER

07:46.266 --> 07:47.801
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

07:47.801 --> 07:48.802
DIRECTOR FOR IRAQ DURING THE

07:48.802 --> 07:49.903
PRESIDENCIES OF GEORGE W. BUSH

07:49.903 --> 07:51.104
AND BARACK OBAMA.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.305
HE IS A SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY

07:52.305 --> 07:53.306
FELLOW AT THE NEW AMERICA

07:53.306 --> 07:55.008
FOUNDATION AND A PARTNER AT

07:55.008 --> 07:56.042
MANTID INTERNATIONAL.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.844
SO, FIRST, WHY THE PAUSE IN

07:57.844 --> 07:58.845
FIGHTING?

07:58.845 --> 07:59.679
>> WELL, WE'RE NOT SURE.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.715
THAT'S A SINGLE-SOURCE REPORT.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.416
WE'RE NOT CONFIDENT THAT IS

08:03.416 --> 08:04.584
WHAT'S HAPPENING, ALTHOUGH

08:04.584 --> 08:06.519
KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

08:06.519 --> 08:08.154
FOG OF BATTLE IS OFTEN

08:08.154 --> 08:08.888
DIFFICULT.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.890
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE

08:10.890 --> 08:12.225
BATTLE HAS BEEN GOING FAIRLY

08:12.225 --> 08:13.426
SUCCESSFULLY.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.761
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY'VE TAKEN

08:14.761 --> 08:15.962
A PAUSE TO CALL FOR MORE

08:15.962 --> 08:17.230
REINFORCEMENTS.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.032
BUT, IN GENERAL, THEY'VE BEEN

08:19.032 --> 08:20.567
PUSHING THROUGH THE CITY OF

08:20.567 --> 08:23.370
TIKRIT, AND WE DO EXPECT THEM TO

08:23.370 --> 08:26.139
CONTROL IT IN DAYS TO, YOU KNOW,

08:26.139 --> 08:27.240
A WEEK OR TEN DAYS AT THE

08:27.240 --> 08:27.674
OUTSIDE.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.475
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, I

08:28.475 --> 08:29.442
REFERENCED A COMMENT FROM ARMY

08:29.442 --> 08:30.744
GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.278
HE SAID THIS WEEK THAT ANY FIGHT

08:32.278 --> 08:33.613
AGAINST ISIS IS A POSITIVE

08:33.613 --> 08:35.415
THING, BUT HE WORRIED:

08:35.415 --> 08:36.916
"WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE DRUMS

08:36.916 --> 08:38.284
STOP BEATING AND ISIL IS

08:38.284 --> 08:39.152
DEFEATED, AND WHETHER THE

08:39.152 --> 08:40.487
GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ WILL REMAIN

08:40.487 --> 08:41.454
ON A PATH TO PROVIDE AN

08:41.454 --> 08:43.156
INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT FOR ALL OF

08:43.156 --> 08:44.190
THE VARIOUS GROUPS WITHIN IT."

08:44.190 --> 08:46.126
>> THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.428
THE GOOD NEWS TODAY IS THAT THE

08:48.428 --> 08:50.764
INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE GOOD.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.198
WE HAVE A FRONT PAGE STORY IN

08:52.198 --> 08:53.333
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" TODAY

08:53.333 --> 08:56.102
ABOUT THE SUNNI RESIDENTS AROUND

08:56.102 --> 08:57.871
TIKRIT BEING OVERJOYED AT BEING

08:57.871 --> 09:00.473
LIBERATED BY THE SHI'A MILITIAS.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.641
IN FACT, WE HAVE A REPORT FROM

09:01.641 --> 09:03.176
A.F.P. THAT STATES THAT SOME OF

09:03.176 --> 09:04.411
THE SHI'A MILITIAS ARE SETTING

09:04.411 --> 09:06.946
UP SUNNI GROUPS WITHIN THEM,

09:06.946 --> 09:08.248
THAT THEY ARE RECRUITING, LIKE,

09:08.248 --> 09:10.950
SUNNI AUXILIARIES TO THEIR

09:10.950 --> 09:11.551
MILITIAS.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.586
SO, THERE ARE SOME INITIAL GOOD

09:13.586 --> 09:14.120
SIGNS.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.455
NOW, OF COURSE, IN THE LONGER

09:15.455 --> 09:16.589
TERM, THE POLITICAL

09:16.589 --> 09:18.091
RECONCILIATION, THE

09:18.091 --> 09:19.793
RECONSTRUCTION OF TIKRIT,

09:19.793 --> 09:21.294
GETTING THE SERVICES BACK UP,

09:21.294 --> 09:24.464
THE ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN-- THESE

09:24.464 --> 09:25.732
ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS

09:25.732 --> 09:27.167
THAT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL IF

09:27.167 --> 09:28.301
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE AS

09:28.301 --> 09:29.169
SUCCESSFUL.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.203
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE'S ALSO

09:30.203 --> 09:31.838
SOME CONCERN, IT SEEMS, ON THE

09:31.838 --> 09:33.973
INVOLVEMENT OF IRAN IN THIS

09:33.973 --> 09:34.407
FIGHT.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.809
THERE WAS A REPORT THAT AN

09:35.809 --> 09:38.144
IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD

09:38.144 --> 09:39.312
COMMANDER WAS SEEN ON THE

09:39.312 --> 09:40.680
BATTLEFIELD OR LEADING SOME OF

09:40.680 --> 09:41.915
THE TROOPS IN TIKRIT.

09:41.915 --> 09:42.982
AND THERE WAS SOME RESPONSE,

09:42.982 --> 09:45.018
ALSO, FROM THE SAUDI FOREIGN

09:45.018 --> 09:46.719
MINISTERS SAYING, "YOU KNOW,

09:46.719 --> 09:47.253
WHAT?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.488
THIS IS PROOF THAT IRAN IS

09:48.488 --> 09:50.256
ESSENTIALLY TAKING OVER IRAQ."

09:50.256 --> 09:51.391
I MEAN, IS IT VERY EASY TO GET

09:51.391 --> 09:52.926
PEOPLE OFF THE BATTLEFIELD AND

09:52.926 --> 09:54.027
SAY, "THANKS FOR THE HELP,

09:54.027 --> 09:55.295
BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY NOW"?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.930
>> WELL, CERTAINLY, IRAN IS

09:56.930 --> 09:58.698
BANKING SOME VERY SERIOUS

09:58.698 --> 10:00.300
POLITICAL CAPITAL WITH THE

10:00.300 --> 10:04.938
IRAQIS IN THEIR INSTANTANEOUS

10:04.938 --> 10:06.840
AND OVERWHELMING SUPPORT IN

10:06.840 --> 10:08.174
THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE ISLAMIC

10:08.174 --> 10:08.942
STATE.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.411
SO, IRAN, IN EFFECT, HAS PAID

10:11.411 --> 10:13.947
ITS DUES AND WILL PROBABLY ENJOY

10:13.947 --> 10:15.949
SOME POLITICAL SUPPORT IN THE

10:15.949 --> 10:17.617
COMING YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.085
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE UNITED

10:19.085 --> 10:20.186
STATES IS JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

10:20.186 --> 10:22.689
KEEP COMPETING WITH IRAN FOR

10:22.689 --> 10:24.557
INFLUENCE IN IRAQ.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.959
IT WOULD BE EASY TO JUST WALK

10:25.959 --> 10:27.994
AWAY, BUT, INSTEAD, WE NEED TO

10:27.994 --> 10:29.762
STAY IN AND REALLY TRY TO

10:29.762 --> 10:33.066
RECOVER FROM SOME MISTAKES, I

10:33.066 --> 10:34.234
THINK, THAT WERE MADE EARLY ON

10:34.234 --> 10:35.602
THAT HAVE GIVEN THE IRANIANS

10:35.602 --> 10:37.470
SOME POSITIONAL ADVANTAGE IN THE

10:37.470 --> 10:38.838
AFTERMATH OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

10:38.838 --> 10:39.639
>> Sreenivasan: IS THAT WHAT'S

10:39.639 --> 10:40.440
LEADING TO SOME OF THE TENSION

10:40.440 --> 10:42.075
IN D.C. RIGHT NOW?

10:42.075 --> 10:42.909
>> I THINK THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF

10:42.909 --> 10:43.243
IT.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.010
I MEAN, THERE ARE, OBVIOUSLY,

10:44.010 --> 10:45.111
ALL TYPES OF THINGS GOING ON

10:45.111 --> 10:46.045
WITH IRAN.

10:46.045 --> 10:48.548
THIS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF IT.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.916
THE NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS ARE IN

10:49.916 --> 10:50.583
THE AIR.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.751
THE COMPETITION WITH SAUDI

10:51.751 --> 10:53.186
ARABIA IS IN THE AIR.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.554
THERE'S A HUGE PROPAGANDA BATTLE

10:54.554 --> 10:57.357
GOING ON, ON THE AIRWAVES, IN

10:57.357 --> 10:59.392
SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU KNOW, FOR THE

10:59.392 --> 11:00.994
ATTENTION OF THE PEOPLE, YOU

11:00.994 --> 11:02.161
KNOW.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.596
LOTS OF ACCUSATIONS THAT

11:03.596 --> 11:05.031
IRANIAN-BACKED GROUPS ARE DOING

11:05.031 --> 11:05.832
THIS.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.666
THEY, OF COURSE, ARE PUSHING

11:06.666 --> 11:08.201
BACK, SAYING THAT'S JUST NOT THE

11:08.201 --> 11:09.068
CASE.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.070
SO, YES, THERE ARE CONCERNS--

11:11.070 --> 11:12.605
SOME OF THEM LEGITIMATE, SOME OF

11:12.605 --> 11:13.740
THEM LESS SO-- AND WE'RE JUST

11:13.740 --> 11:15.308
GOING TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS OUT

11:15.308 --> 11:16.543
IN THE LONGER TERM.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.777
BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY

11:17.777 --> 11:19.646
ALTERNATIVE TO LETTING THE

11:19.646 --> 11:20.413
IRANIANS HELP.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.681
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TELL

11:21.681 --> 11:23.049
THE IRAQIS, KICK THEM OUT OF

11:23.049 --> 11:24.651
COUNTRY AND FIGHT THE ISLAMIC

11:24.651 --> 11:25.752
STATE WITHOUT THIS AID.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.220
THAT'S NOT GOING TO FLY, EITHER.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.154
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, DOUG

11:28.154 --> 11:29.055
OLLIVANT JOINING US FROM

11:29.055 --> 11:29.856
WASHINGTON, D.C.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.590
THANKS SO MUCH.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.025
>> ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.102
>> Sreenivasan: THIS WEEK, MANY

11:43.102 --> 11:44.103
PUBLIC TELEVISION STATIONS

11:44.103 --> 11:45.438
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ONCE

11:45.438 --> 11:47.073
AGAIN TAKING TIME OUT TO ASK FOR

11:47.073 --> 11:48.441
YOUR SUPPORT.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.809
WITH THAT IN MIND, WE ARE TAKING

11:49.809 --> 11:51.477
TIME TO UPDATE YOU ON SOME OF

OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENTS.

11:52.912 --> 11:53.846
IN THIS STORY THAT WAS

11:53.846 --> 11:55.481
ORIGINALLY BROADCAST LAST JULY,

11:55.481 --> 11:57.183
WE ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF

11:57.183 --> 11:59.552
YOUR ONLINE BANKING, TRAVEL AND

11:59.552 --> 12:02.155
EMAIL ACCOUNTS AFTER YOU DIE?

12:02.155 --> 12:03.756
AS IT TURNS OUT, MANAGING ONE'S

12:03.756 --> 12:05.425
"DIGITAL ESTATE" IS A

12:05.425 --> 12:07.860
COMPLICATED JOB.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.462
DO YOU HAVE AN EMAIL ACCOUNT?

12:09.462 --> 12:10.964
HOW ABOUT A FACEBOOK PAGE?

12:10.964 --> 12:12.131
DO YOU BANK ONLINE?

12:12.131 --> 12:13.199
SHOP ONLINE?

12:13.199 --> 12:15.001
PAY YOUR GAS, LIGHT OR CABLE TV

12:15.001 --> 12:16.836
BILL OVER THE INTERNET?

12:16.836 --> 12:17.804
I'VE JUST LAID OUT MORE THAN A

12:17.804 --> 12:19.238
HALF DOZEN ACCOUNTS THAT MANY OF

12:19.238 --> 12:21.174
US HAVE, LIKELY EACH WITH ITS

12:21.174 --> 12:22.775
OWN PASSWORD.

12:22.775 --> 12:23.910
THESE ACCOUNTS DON'T DIE WITH

12:23.910 --> 12:24.744
US.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.346
THE PASSWORDS TO EACH OF THEM

12:26.346 --> 12:27.880
ARE OFTEN TIMES LOCKED AWAY WITH

12:27.880 --> 12:30.583
ONLY ONE PERSON, THE DECEASED.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.185
WHICH MEANS THAT VALUABLE ONLINE

12:32.185 --> 12:34.654
ASSETS COULD BE LOST FOREVER OR

12:34.654 --> 12:36.356
BE FOUND BY THOSE LOOKING TO

12:36.356 --> 12:37.557
EXPLOIT THEM.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.758
TAKE THE CASE OF GLENN

12:38.758 --> 12:40.693
WILLIAMSON, A TECH ENTREPRENEUR

12:40.693 --> 12:42.128
IN PORTLAND, OREGON.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.763
IN AUGUST OF 2012, HE GOT THE

12:43.763 --> 12:45.632
WORST NEWS POSSIBLE.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.666
>> I WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES

12:46.666 --> 12:48.868
SPEAKING AT A CONFERENCE, AND,

12:48.868 --> 12:50.403
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR PHONE GOES

12:50.403 --> 12:51.938
OFF 15 TIMES AND IT'S 3:00 IN

12:51.938 --> 12:52.772
THE MORNING IN THE UNITED

12:52.772 --> 12:54.707
STATES, YOU HAVE A BAD FEELING.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.975
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A GOOD CALL.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.176
>> Sreenivasan: GLENN'S 73-YEAR-

12:57.176 --> 12:59.112
OLD MOTHER, LEE, HAD DIED.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.214
AS HER FIDUCIARY AND AS A 25-

13:01.214 --> 13:02.749
YEAR VETERAN OF THE TECH WORLD,

13:02.749 --> 13:04.450
IT FELL TO HIM TO MANAGE HER

13:04.450 --> 13:06.185
ONLINE ACCOUNTS.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.320
>> I KNEW MY MOM, BEING A COOL

13:07.320 --> 13:08.788
GRANDMA, WAS ON TWITTER.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.922
SO, I KNEW SHE WAS ON TWITTER

13:09.922 --> 13:10.723
AND I KNEW SHE HAD A YAHOO

13:10.723 --> 13:11.224
ACCOUNT.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.192
SO, WE HAD A BASELINE TO START,

13:13.192 --> 13:14.794
BUT THAT'S ALL WE KNEW.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.928

13:15.928 --> 13:18.197
OF SEARCHING, GLENN FOUND 13

13:23.970 --> 13:25.238
>> SO, WE BROKE IT DOWN INTO

13:25.238 --> 13:26.973
CATEGORIES-- TRAVEL, SENTIMENTAL

13:26.973 --> 13:29.208
VALUE, SECURITY-- AND BASICALLY

13:29.208 --> 13:30.743
WE SEARCHED ON ABOUT 75

13:30.743 --> 13:31.611
DIFFERENT SITES.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.578
>> Sreenivasan: SOME HAD REAL

13:32.578 --> 13:33.312
VALUE.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.447
AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE

13:34.447 --> 13:36.616
AIRLINES WE GOT TO UNITED, AND

13:36.616 --> 13:38.484
UNITED, DID, INDEED HAVE MY MOM

13:38.484 --> 13:39.852
AS A CUSTOMER.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.421
AND THERE WAS 54,000 MILES THAT

13:41.421 --> 13:43.156
WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE FOR OUR

13:43.156 --> 13:43.756
FAMILY.

13:43.756 --> 13:44.791
>> Sreenivasan: ALL THIS WHILE

13:44.791 --> 13:46.225
HE WAS GRIEVING.

13:46.225 --> 13:47.193
>> AND IT'S A PAINFUL... IT'S A

13:47.193 --> 13:48.361
LONG PROCESS.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.996
AND EVERYBODY MEANS WELL, BUT IF

13:49.996 --> 13:51.164
ONE MORE PERSON TELLS YOU

13:51.164 --> 13:53.800
THEY'RE SORRY, IT'S LIKE, OKAY,

13:53.800 --> 13:54.701
I JUST NEED TO KNOW, DID SHE

13:54.701 --> 13:55.835
HAVE AN ACCOUNT OR NOT?

13:55.835 --> 13:56.569
>> Sreenivasan: WILLIAMSON AND

13:56.569 --> 13:58.304
HIS WIFE ARE ONLINE SAVVY,

13:58.304 --> 13:59.639
RELATIVELY YOUNG, AND IT WAS

13:59.639 --> 14:01.340
STILL TOUGH TO FIND ALL THOSE

14:01.340 --> 14:02.275
ACCOUNTS.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.376
>> SO, THE AVERAGE PERSON,

14:03.376 --> 14:04.877
ESPECIALLY IF THE AVERAGE PERSON

14:04.877 --> 14:07.380
IS DOING IT IN THEIR 60s, IT'S A

14:07.380 --> 14:09.048
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.083
>> Sreenivasan: GLENN'S PROBLEMS

14:10.083 --> 14:11.517
MANAGING HIS MOTHER'S ONLINE

14:11.517 --> 14:13.386
ESTATE HELPED INSPIRE HIM TO

14:13.386 --> 14:15.054
START A BUSINESS SOLUTION CALLED

14:15.054 --> 14:17.023
WEBCEASE, AN ONLINE SERVICE THAT

14:17.023 --> 14:18.324
HELPS PEOPLE SEARCH FOR THEIR

14:18.324 --> 14:20.159
DECEASED LOVED ONES' DIGITAL

14:20.159 --> 14:21.027
ASSETS.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.528
IT USES A PERSON'S BASIC

14:22.528 --> 14:23.796
INFORMATION, LIKE AN EMAIL

14:23.796 --> 14:25.598
ADDRESS, AND FINDS THE MAJOR

14:25.598 --> 14:26.966
ONLINE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE LINKED

14:26.966 --> 14:27.834
TO IT.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.435
AND ALTHOUGH WEBCEASE WON'T SHUT

14:29.435 --> 14:31.304
DOWN AN ACCOUNT FOR YOU, IT WILL

14:31.304 --> 14:33.139
TELL YOU WHAT CAN BE DONE UNDER

14:33.139 --> 14:34.774
A WEB SITE'S SPECIFIC TERMS-OF-

14:34.774 --> 14:35.875
SERVICE.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.143
>> MY MOM HAD AN ASSET INVENTORY

14:37.143 --> 14:38.578
OF HER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS, BUT

14:38.578 --> 14:40.279
SHE DIDN'T HAVE AN ASSET

14:40.279 --> 14:42.081
INVENTORY OF ALL THINGS DIGITAL.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.116
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE

14:43.116 --> 14:44.650
PROVIDE TO THE FAMILY IS, WE

14:44.650 --> 14:46.652
PROVIDE THEM AT A HIGH LEVEL A

14:46.652 --> 14:48.121
DIGITAL ASSET INVENTORY.

14:48.121 --> 14:48.955
SO, YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH IT AND

14:48.955 --> 14:50.656
SAY, "OH, MY MOM WAS ON AMAZON

14:50.656 --> 14:52.258
AND iTUNES, AND SHE HAD MARRIOTT

14:52.258 --> 14:53.626
AND HYATT, ET CETERA."

14:53.626 --> 14:54.660
SO, THAT'S REALLY THE VALUE WE

14:54.660 --> 14:55.461
PROVIDE.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.362
>> Sreenivasan: WEBCEASE IS ONE

14:56.362 --> 14:58.030
OF A HANDFUL OF WEB SITES THAT

14:58.030 --> 14:59.665
HAS SPRUNG UP OVER THE LAST FEW

14:59.665 --> 15:00.500
YEARS.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.301
SITES LIKE NAVIGATR, THE DOC

15:02.301 --> 15:04.904
SAFE, CAPSOOLE, MY CYBER SAFE,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.672
AND AFTERNOTE-- ALL OF THEM

15:06.672 --> 15:07.640
TRYING TO TACKLE WHAT IS

15:07.640 --> 15:09.408
BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY COMMON

15:09.408 --> 15:10.309
PROBLEM.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.111
>> NOWADAYS, EVERYONE KEEPS

15:12.111 --> 15:14.213
THEIR FILING CABINETS ON THEIR

15:14.213 --> 15:16.048
COMPUTERS, AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE

15:16.048 --> 15:18.050
SHARED THE ACCESS TO THAT WITH

15:18.050 --> 15:19.152
THEIR FAMILIES.

15:19.152 --> 15:19.952
>> Sreenivasan: SUZANNE WALSH IS

15:19.952 --> 15:21.187
AN ESTATE LAWYER IN HARTFORD,

15:21.187 --> 15:21.988
CONNECTICUT.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.322
>> I HAVE RECEIVED PANICKED

15:23.322 --> 15:26.058
CALLS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

15:26.058 --> 15:27.894
DON'T KNOW PASSWORDS, DON'T KNOW

15:27.894 --> 15:29.428
THE NATURE OF THE ONLINE

15:29.428 --> 15:30.096
ACCOUNTS.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.731
THEY SIMPLY KNOW MOM PAID THE

15:31.731 --> 15:33.332
BILLS ONLINE, AND THEY MAY NOT

15:33.332 --> 15:34.667
EVEN BE SURE ABOUT THE BANK.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.635
>> Sreenivasan: WALSH SAYS THAT

15:35.635 --> 15:36.969
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS ONE OF

15:36.969 --> 15:37.837
ACCESS.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.105
IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE MADE IT

15:39.105 --> 15:41.073
VIRTUALLY ILLEGAL FOR ANYONE

15:41.073 --> 15:43.309
ELSE TO USE OUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.011
IT STARTS WITH THOSE TERMS OF

15:45.011 --> 15:46.412
SERVICE AGREEMENTS, THE FINE

15:46.412 --> 15:48.648
PRINT OF THE ONLINE WORLD.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.082
ONCE THE "I AGREE" BUTTON IS

15:50.082 --> 15:51.584
PRESSED, IT'S AS GOOD AS A

15:51.584 --> 15:52.785
CONTRACT.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.487
>> MANY OF THEM PROHIBIT THE

15:54.487 --> 15:56.022
SHARING OF PASSWORDS, AND THEY

15:56.022 --> 15:58.157
PROHIBIT THIRD-PARTY ACCESS.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.159
SO, RIGHT NOW, THEY TEND TO BAR

16:00.159 --> 16:01.527
ANYBODY BUT THE ACCOUNT HOLDER

16:01.527 --> 16:02.795
ACCESSING THE ACCOUNT.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.996
>> Sreenivasan: THAT MEANS EVEN

16:03.996 --> 16:06.365
IF THE ACCOUNT HOLDER IS DEAD.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.134
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS SAY

16:08.134 --> 16:09.502
THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE LETTER OF

16:09.502 --> 16:11.270
THE LAW AS SPELLED OUT IN THE

16:11.270 --> 16:14.407
1986 STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT,

16:14.407 --> 16:15.708
WHICH PROHIBITS ANYONE FROM

16:15.708 --> 16:17.143
ACCESSING PRIVATE INFORMATION

16:17.143 --> 16:19.178
ONLINE WITHOUT PERMISSION.

16:19.178 --> 16:20.613
>> THE PROBLEM WITH FIDUCIARY

16:20.613 --> 16:23.583
ACCESS NOW IS THAT IT MAY BE A

16:23.583 --> 16:25.685
VIOLATION OF FEDERAL PRIVACY LAW

16:25.685 --> 16:27.119
OR A COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE

16:27.119 --> 16:27.553
ACT.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.622
IT MAY BE AN ACTUAL CRIMINAL ACT

16:29.622 --> 16:31.390
TO VIOLATE THE TERMS OF SERVICE

16:31.390 --> 16:32.158
AGREEMENT.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.159
>> Sreenivasan: BUT BEING UNABLE

16:33.159 --> 16:34.427
TO ACCESS OR SHUT DOWN A

16:34.427 --> 16:36.062
DECEASED LOVED ONE'S ACCOUNTS

16:36.062 --> 16:38.531
COULD HAVE UNFORESEEN RISKS, AS

16:38.531 --> 16:40.132
GLENN WILLIAMSON, WHO SPENT 20

16:40.132 --> 16:41.567
YEARS IN ONLINE SECURITY, WILL

16:41.567 --> 16:42.168
TELL YOU.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.069
>> THE YEAR AFTER SOMEBODY

16:43.069 --> 16:44.837
PASSES IS ONE OF THE MOST

16:44.837 --> 16:46.539
VULNERABLE TIMES FOR IDENTITY

16:46.539 --> 16:47.340
THEFT.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.741
IT'S A HEINOUS CRIME, BUT WHAT

16:48.741 --> 16:50.176
THE BAD GUYS DO, BECAUSE DEATH

16:50.176 --> 16:51.944
IS PUBLIC RECORD, THEY'LL GO OUT

16:51.944 --> 16:53.980
THERE AND THEY'LL COMB FOR

16:53.980 --> 16:55.181
RECENTLY DECEASED AND THEY'LL

16:55.181 --> 16:56.349
CREATE A FAKE IDENTITY.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.251
BECAUSE THE DECEASED DON'T CHECK

16:58.251 --> 16:59.585
EMAILS, AND THEY DON'T GET THE

16:59.585 --> 16:59.919
MAIL.

16:59.919 --> 17:00.953
>> Sreenivasan: EVERY YEAR, MORE

17:00.953 --> 17:02.521
THAN TWO MILLION AMERICANS ARE

17:02.521 --> 17:03.990
THE POSTHUMOUS VICTIMS OF

17:03.990 --> 17:05.258
IDENTITY FRAUD.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.859
THIEVES CAN USE A DEAD PERSON'S

17:06.859 --> 17:08.427
INFORMATION TO RACK UP CREDIT

17:08.427 --> 17:10.863
CARD CHARGES, APPLY FOR LOANS OR

17:10.863 --> 17:13.432
EVEN FILE FALSE TAX RETURNS.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.667
AND MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION CAN

17:14.667 --> 17:16.435
BE FOUND ON THE INTERNET THROUGH

17:16.435 --> 17:17.670
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A

17:17.670 --> 17:18.905
SHOPPING ACCOUNT.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.539
TO DATE, ONLY NINE STATES HAVE

17:20.539 --> 17:22.241
ANY LAWS IN EFFECT THAT GOVERN

17:22.241 --> 17:24.110
ONLINE ESTATE PLANNING.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.311
SUZANNE WALSH, WHO CHAIRS A

17:25.311 --> 17:26.646
COMMITTEE ON THE UNIFORM LAW

17:26.646 --> 17:28.114
COMMISSION, AN ORGANIZATION

17:28.114 --> 17:29.615
WHICH DRAFTS LAWS IT HOPES TO

17:29.615 --> 17:31.651
STANDARDIZE IN ALL 50 STATES, IS

17:31.651 --> 17:33.185
TRYING TO CHANGE THAT.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.687
LAST YEAR, WALSH'S COMMITTEE

17:34.687 --> 17:36.255
FINISHED DRAFTING A BILL CALLED

17:36.255 --> 17:38.357
THE "FIDUCIARY ACCESS TO DIGITAL

17:38.357 --> 17:40.059
ASSETS ACT," WHICH WOULD GIVE

17:40.059 --> 17:41.694
FIDUCIARIES THE SAME RIGHTS OVER

17:41.694 --> 17:44.297
ONLINE ESTATES AS THEY NOW HAVE

17:44.297 --> 17:45.932
OVER PHYSICAL ESTATES.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.199
>> FIDUCIARIES, TRADITIONALLY,

17:47.199 --> 17:48.901
HAVE ACCESS TO EVERYTHING IN

17:48.901 --> 17:49.902
ADMIN... ESPECIALLY IN

17:49.902 --> 17:51.404
ADMINISTERING ESTATES.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.972
AND THAT USED TO MEAN OPENING UP

17:52.972 --> 17:54.607
THE MAILBOX, OPENING UP THE FILE

17:54.607 --> 17:55.675
CABINET, RIFLING THROUGH THE

17:55.675 --> 17:57.143
DESK.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.145
OUR ACT IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE

17:59.145 --> 18:01.280
THAT AND FACILITATE THAT, GIVEN

18:01.280 --> 18:02.481
THE DIFFERENT NATURE OF THE

18:02.481 --> 18:03.382
DIGITAL ASSETS.

18:03.382 --> 18:04.150
>> Sreenivasan: THE BILL WAS

18:04.150 --> 18:05.184
REVIEWED AND ENACTED BY THE

18:05.184 --> 18:07.153
UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION LAST

18:07.153 --> 18:08.988
JULY, BUT IT'S STILL UP TO

18:08.988 --> 18:11.057
INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATURES TO

18:11.057 --> 18:13.225
PROPOSE IT AND PASS IT AS LAW.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.026
ALTHOUGH THE ACT HAS BEEN

18:14.026 --> 18:16.829
INTRODUCED IN 18 STATES, SO FAR,

18:16.829 --> 18:18.831
ONLY ONE STATE, DELAWARE, HAS

18:18.831 --> 18:20.566
SIGNED THE ACT INTO LAW.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.501
HOWEVER, THE ACT IS NOT WITHOUT

18:22.501 --> 18:23.602
ITS CRITICS.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.637
THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF A

18:24.637 --> 18:26.238
WASHINGTON, D.C.-BASED GROUP

18:26.238 --> 18:28.240
CALLED THE STATE PRIVACY AND

18:28.240 --> 18:29.942
SECURITY COALITION, WHICH

18:29.942 --> 18:31.043
REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF

18:31.043 --> 18:32.945
GOOGLE, YAHOO AND FACEBOOK,

18:32.945 --> 18:34.947
AMONG OTHERS, CAME OUT AGAINST

18:34.947 --> 18:36.816
DELAWARE'S NEW LAW, SAYING,

18:36.816 --> 18:38.951
"THIS LAW TAKES NO ACCOUNT OF

18:38.951 --> 18:40.720
MINIMIZING INTRUSIONS INTO THE

18:40.720 --> 18:42.488
PRIVACY OF THIRD PARTIES WHO

18:42.488 --> 18:44.490
COMMUNICATED WITH THE DECEASED.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.858
THIS WOULD INCLUDE HIGHLY

18:45.858 --> 18:47.226
CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO

18:47.226 --> 18:49.061
DECEDENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES WHO

18:49.061 --> 18:50.963
ARE STILL ALIVE, WHO WOULD BE

18:50.963 --> 18:52.798
VERY SURPRISED THAT AN EXECUTOR

18:52.798 --> 18:53.833
IS REVIEWING THE

18:53.833 --> 18:55.101
COMMUNICATIONS."

18:55.101 --> 18:56.569
BUT, DESPITE THE PUSHBACK,

18:56.569 --> 18:58.070
SUZANNE WALSH IS HOPEFUL THAT

18:58.070 --> 18:59.605
HER COMMITTEE'S WORK WILL BE

18:59.605 --> 19:00.906
RECOGNIZED IN MORE STATE

19:00.906 --> 19:02.041
LEGISLATURES.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.843
>> WIDESPREAD ENACTMENT IS OUR

19:03.843 --> 19:04.443
GOAL.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.611
THAT'S OUR PRIMARY GOAL.

19:05.611 --> 19:06.979
CERTAINLY, WE HOPE AND EXPECT

19:06.979 --> 19:08.981
THAT IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A

19:08.981 --> 19:10.783
YEAR OR TWO FOR MOST OF THE

19:10.783 --> 19:12.251
STATES TO ADOPT THIS PRODUCT.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.252
>> Sreenivasan: WHILE THE STATES

19:13.252 --> 19:14.887
DEBATE THE ACT, SOME INTERNET

19:14.887 --> 19:16.155
SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEGUN

19:16.155 --> 19:17.857
PROPOSING THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS TO

19:17.857 --> 19:19.558
THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY DIGITAL

19:19.558 --> 19:20.893
ESTATES.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.362
IN 2013, GOOGLE INTRODUCED A NEW

19:23.362 --> 19:25.664
FEATURE CALLED "INACTIVE ACCOUNT

19:25.664 --> 19:27.199
MANAGER," WHICH WOULD GIVE USERS

19:27.199 --> 19:28.601
THE CHOICE OF HAVING THEIR

19:28.601 --> 19:30.336
ACCOUNTS TRANSFERRED TO SPECIFIC

19:30.336 --> 19:32.571
PEOPLE AFTER A SET PERIOD OF

19:32.571 --> 19:34.740
INACTIVITY OR HAVING THEM

19:34.740 --> 19:36.409
AUTOMATICALLY DELETED.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.044
AND LAST MONTH, FACEBOOK

19:38.044 --> 19:39.578
ANNOUNCED THEIR OWN FEATURE FOR

19:39.578 --> 19:40.946
DEALING WITH DIGITAL ESTATE

19:40.946 --> 19:42.515
MANAGEMENT CALLED "LEGACY

19:42.515 --> 19:43.382
CONTACTS."

19:43.382 --> 19:45.017
USERS CAN NOW CHOOSE A FACEBOOK

19:45.017 --> 19:46.652
FRIEND TO MAINTAIN THEIR ACCOUNT

19:46.652 --> 19:48.554
AFTER THEY DIE, BUT THE

DECEASED.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.295
FACEBOOK USERS ALSO HAVE THE

19:56.295 --> 19:57.596
OPTION TO HAVE THEIR ACCOUNT

19:57.596 --> 19:59.799
DELETED UPON THEIR DEATH.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.367
BUT BEYOND NEW USER FEATURES AND

20:01.367 --> 20:03.202
STATE LAWS, THERE ARE STEPS THAT

20:03.202 --> 20:04.870
PEOPLE CAN TAKE NOW TO MAKE THE

20:04.870 --> 20:06.138
PROCESS OF DIGITAL ESTATE

20:06.138 --> 20:08.374
MANAGEMENT EASIER ON NEXT OF

20:08.374 --> 20:09.575
KIN.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.077
FIRST, CREATE AN INVENTORY LIST

20:11.077 --> 20:12.545
OF ALL YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS AND

20:12.545 --> 20:14.914
PASSWORDS FOR YOUR FIDUCIARY.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.182
STIPULATE WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR

20:16.182 --> 20:18.217
EMAIL ACCOUNTS IN A WILL, AND

20:18.217 --> 20:19.151
READ THE TERMS-OF-SERVICE

20:19.151 --> 20:20.653
AGREEMENTS SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

20:20.653 --> 20:22.888
HOW OR EVEN IF ACCESS TO YOUR

20:22.888 --> 20:24.323
ACCOUNTS CAN BE GRANTED TO

20:24.323 --> 20:25.324
SOMEONE ELSE.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.926
BUT GLENN WILLIAMSON SAYS, NO

20:26.926 --> 20:28.727
MATTER WHAT STEPS YOU TAKE OR

20:28.727 --> 20:30.596
WHAT LAWS ARE EVENTUALLY PASSED,

20:30.596 --> 20:32.465
MANAGING A DIGITAL ESTATE FOR A

20:32.465 --> 20:34.433
LOVED ONE WILL ALWAYS BE A LONG,

20:34.433 --> 20:37.503
ARDUOUS AND PAINFUL PROCESS.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.273
LEARN HOW TO MANAGE YOUR DIGITAL

20:41.273 --> 20:42.675
ESTATE AND KEEP YOUR ACCOUNTS

20:42.675 --> 20:43.609
PROTECTED.

20:43.609 --> 20:44.543
READ OUR GUIDE AT

20:58.190 --> 20:59.291
DOCTORS HAVE NOT RELEASED HIS

20:59.291 --> 21:00.559
NAME BUT SAY HIS CONDITION IS

21:00.559 --> 21:01.594
SERIOUS.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.762
TEN OTHER U.S. AID WORKERS MIGHT

21:03.762 --> 21:05.464
ALSO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND ARE

21:05.464 --> 21:06.432

WELL.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.034
NONE HAVE YET TESTED POSITIVE.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.469
MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE HAVE

21:10.469 --> 21:13.038
DIED OF EBOLA IN THE PAST YEAR.

IT'S FAILING.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.017

21:58.017 --> 21:58.884
>> FOR ALL THE CRITICISMS THAT

21:58.884 --> 22:00.219
WE GET, WE REALLY DON'T GET UP

22:00.219 --> 22:01.720
