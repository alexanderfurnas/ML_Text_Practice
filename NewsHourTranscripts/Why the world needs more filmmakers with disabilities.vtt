JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask interesting

00:04.900 --> 00:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe
their passions.

00:06.833 --> 00:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we continue our
week-long theme of hearing from
people with disabilities and

00:10.166 --> 00:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how they deal with the
challenges of everyday life.

Reid Davenport is a
documentarian whose
films focus on people
living with disabilities.

00:17.533 --> 00:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His latest project is
called "Through My Lens."

REID DAVENPORT, Documentarian:
I have cerebral palsy.

00:25.133 --> 00:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would like people to
see that my diagnosis is
not my biggest obstacle.

00:28.233 --> 00:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My biggest obstacle is people's
responses to my diagnosis.

00:32.966 --> 00:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Do people, do you
find, underestimate you?

00:36.633 --> 00:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID DAVENPORT: I mean, I
have been underestimated
my whole life.

00:43.633 --> 00:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when that happens, you
instantly figure out who
not to waste your time with.

00:56.533 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The people who gawk at me on
the streets remind me of the
profound ignorance in the world.

01:09.100 --> 01:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't mean to sound
preachy, but it really affects
my life, and, in turn, I'm

01:24.866 --> 01:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure, affects many other
people with disabilities.

01:32.933 --> 01:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I cannot underestimate how
strong and how prevalent these
stigmas surrounding disability

01:48.066 --> 01:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the media are.

01:51.733 --> 01:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There needs to be more
filmmakers with disabilities,
so they can experience the

02:05.066 --> 02:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
catharsis that I have
been able to experience.

02:09.133 --> 02:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is still such exclusion
in society, that, for me,
if I am the first person to

02:25.266 --> 02:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bring disability to your
purview, then we have
such a long way to go.

02:37.633 --> 02:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Reid Davenport.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take on seeing
the world through my lens.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reid
Davenport, we owe you a
huge debt of gratitude.

02:47.266 --> 02:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope everyone watching
this segment will share it
with you someone you know.
