WEBVTT

00:07.774 --> 00:12.913
GWEN IFILL: A landslide
vote against austerity.

00:12.913 --> 00:17.784
Greeks reject European
terms for a bailout,

00:17.784 --> 00:20.821
a risky gamble with banks
the verge on collapse.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.422
Good evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:22.422 --> 00:25.025
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:25.025 --> 00:30.631
Also ahead this Monday: a World
Cup win for team USA in soccer
-- what the American women's

00:30.631 --> 00:35.402
third title means for the
future of the sport.

00:35.402 --> 00:42.709
GWEN IFILL: Plus, celebrating
50 years of good vibes with the
Grateful Dead, who spent

00:42.709 --> 00:46.079
the weekend saying farewell
to their devoted fans.

00:46.079 --> 00:50.284
BILL KREUTZMANN, Grateful Dead:
We were just really gung-ho,
wanting to play. And

00:50.284 --> 00:52.319
that's what -- that's how you
feel about every day. Any day
you had a chance to play music,

00:52.319 --> 00:54.721
you got together and played.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.491
JUDY WOODRUFF: Those are some
of the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.491 --> 00:59.293
(BREAK)

00:59.293 --> 01:03.330
JUDY WOODRUFF: The leaders of
Germany and France pressed the
Greek government today

01:03.330 --> 01:08.602
to offer up serious financial
aid proposals in an effort to
jump-start a new round of

01:08.602 --> 01:13.240
talks. That comes a day after
more than 61 percent of Greek
voters rejected the terms

01:13.240 --> 01:16.143
of an international
bailout deal.

01:16.143 --> 01:21.481
Meanwhile, the European Central
Bank moved to raise the amount
of collateral Greek banks

01:21.481 --> 01:26.320
must pay for emergency loans.
We will take a closer look at
the impact of the landslide

01:26.320 --> 01:31.191
vote, and talk to Greece's
ambassador to the U.S., right
after this news summary.

01:31.191 --> 01:35.429
GWEN IFILL: Greece's economic
uncertainty pushed stocks lower
on Wall Street today.

01:35.429 --> 01:41.902
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 46 points to close
at 17683. The Nasdaq fell

01:41.902 --> 01:46.473
17 points, and the S&P
500 slipped eight.

01:46.473 --> 01:52.279
JUDY WOODRUFF: Twin bombings
rocked Central Nigeria
overnight, killing 44 people.
The

01:52.279 --> 01:58.418
blasts targeted a Muslim
restaurant and a mosque in Jos,
about 150 miles northeast of

01:58.418 --> 02:03.890
the capital, Abuja. Nearly 70
people were wounded, including
many who were rushed to

02:03.890 --> 02:08.729
the hospital last night for
treatment. The attacks were
believed to be the work of
Islamic

02:08.729 --> 02:13.734
State affiliate Boko Haram. The
militants have killed more than
300 Nigerians in the

02:13.734 --> 02:15.702
past week alone.

02:15.702 --> 02:20.407
GWEN IFILL: Combating the
Islamic State was at the top of
the agenda as President

02:20.407 --> 02:25.012
Obama paid a rare visit to the
Pentagon this afternoon. He met
with top military leaders

02:25.012 --> 02:30.350
for a briefing on the ongoing
U.S.-led campaign against the
militant group.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.053
Afterward, the president said
the fight won't be quick, but
acknowledged the significant

02:33.053 --> 02:35.689
progress made so far.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.425
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Our coalition
has now hit ISIL with more

02:38.425 --> 02:43.397
than 5,000 airstrikes. We have
taken out thousands of fighting
positions, tanks, vehicles,

02:43.397 --> 02:46.700
bomb factories, and
training camps.

02:46.700 --> 02:52.773
We have eliminated thousands of
fighters, including senior ISIL
commanders. And over

02:52.773 --> 02:56.576
the past year, we have seen
that, when we have an effective
partner on the ground, ISIL

02:56.576 --> 02:59.279
can be pushed back.

02:59.279 --> 03:04.317
GWEN IFILL: The president's
statement followed an uptick in
U.S.-led coalition airstrikes

03:04.317 --> 03:09.423
in Syria over the weekend. The
aerial operations targeted
Islamic State-controlled
structures

03:09.423 --> 03:13.627
and transit routes surrounding
the militants' stronghold of
Raqqa.

03:13.627 --> 03:18.598
JUDY WOODRUFF: Foreign
ministers from six world powers
met with their Iranian
counterpart

03:18.598 --> 03:23.937
today in Vienna to make one
final push ahead of tomorrow's
deadline to reach a nuclear

03:23.937 --> 03:29.176
weapons agreement. But there
were no major signs of progress,
as U.S. Secretary of State

03:29.176 --> 03:35.282
John Kerry negotiated alongside
officials from five other
nations and Iran.

03:35.282 --> 03:39.052
His spokesman warned, if the
Iranian regime doesn't adhere to
previous agreements, there

03:39.052 --> 03:41.788
will be no deal.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.324
REAR ADM. JOHN KIRBY, Pentagon
Press Secretary: We will only
accept a deal that effectively

03:44.324 --> 03:48.862
close off Iran's pathways to a
nuclear weapon, and it will have
to be a deal that can stand

03:48.862 --> 03:54.701
up to the scrutiny of not just
our experts but experts around
the world. We're not

03:54.701 --> 03:58.839
there yet, and there are some
important issues still to be
resolved.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.842
JUDY WOODRUFF: A White House
spokesman acknowledged it was
certainly possible that
tomorrow's

04:01.842 --> 04:04.845
self-imposed
deadline could slip.

04:04.845 --> 04:09.683
GWEN IFILL: South Carolina's
statehouse is one step closer to
removing the Confederate

04:09.683 --> 04:14.788
Battle Flag from a pole on its
grounds in Columbia. The state
Senate passed a crucial

04:14.788 --> 04:19.693
vote on legislation that would
take down the flag. But the
bill still requires approval

04:19.693 --> 04:24.664
from the state's House of
Representatives and Republican
Governor Nikki Haley, who
recently

04:24.664 --> 04:29.136
reversed course and said the
flag should be removed. The
debate comes amid growing
criticism

04:29.136 --> 04:32.772
in the wake of a shooting
rampage at a black church in
Charleston.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.777
Hundreds of thousands of
faithful gathered in Ecuador's
main port city today to watch

04:37.777 --> 04:42.916
Pope Francis celebrate mass.
The service, which was dedicated
to families, was held

04:42.916 --> 04:47.854
in a park in Guayaquil. It's
the pontiff's second visit to
his native region since becoming

04:47.854 --> 04:53.860
the leader of the Catholic
Church in 2013. He travels next
to Bolivia and Paraguay.

04:53.860 --> 04:59.533
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was
disclosed today that comedian
Bill Cosby admitted in a 2005

04:59.533 --> 05:04.938
deposition that he had obtained
quaaludes to drug women he
wanted to have sex with.

05:04.938 --> 05:09.943
That is according to court
documents made public. Cosby
has been accused by more than

05:09.943 --> 05:15.182
two dozen women of sexual
misconduct in incidents dating
back more than four decades. He
has

05:15.182 --> 05:18.351
never been criminally charged.

05:18.351 --> 05:24.724
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a vote against austerity sends
Greece into the unknown; what's

05:24.724 --> 05:31.598
next for women's soccer after
team USA's World Cup win?; the
week ahead in politics with

05:31.598 --> 05:37.804
Tamara Keith and Susan Page;
good vibes, nostalgia and
farewells from the Grateful
Dead; and

05:37.804 --> 05:44.344
why more Americans are
moving to Mexico to retire.

05:44.344 --> 05:55.622
GWEN IFILL: A historic moment
in Greece this weekend, as
voters drew the line on more

05:55.622 --> 06:02.395
austerity after five years of
government cuts. But can Greece
strike a new deal with its

06:02.395 --> 06:08.335
creditors? Or will they be
forced to or choose to leave the
Eurozone altogether?

06:08.335 --> 06:13.173
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant begins our coverage from
Athens.

06:13.173 --> 06:19.713
MALCOLM BRABANT: It was a
resounding no to more austerity
and the results of the
referendum

06:19.713 --> 06:23.583
were greeted with loud
celebrations in Syntagma Square.

06:23.583 --> 06:27.954
CHRISTINA VLACHAKI, Greece
(through translator): This is
our first step to our next
battle.

06:27.954 --> 06:31.925
Now it truly starts. I do not
think that everything will
suddenly be perfect, but it

06:31.925 --> 06:35.428
is a first step in
making fear go away.

06:35.428 --> 06:40.667
NIKI KALOMIRI, Greece: This
result filled me with hope for
tomorrow for Greece. I'm

06:40.667 --> 06:47.173
very proud of the Greek people,
very, very proud. We don't want
to be slaves.

06:47.173 --> 06:51.544
MALCOLM BRABANT: First thing
this morning, Prime Minister
Alexis Tsipras convened a
meeting

06:51.544 --> 06:56.750
with Greek political leaders,
asking for and winning broad
support as he tries to restart

06:56.750 --> 07:01.921
negotiations with international
lenders. Many in Greece believe
it will be a bumpy ride.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.491
NICK MALKOUTZIS, Editor,
MacroPolis: There have to be
doubts about whether the Tsipras

07:04.491 --> 07:08.795
government can negotiate itself
out of this corner. Over the
last six months, there

07:08.795 --> 07:13.166
have been many, many mistakes,
man dead ends that they have
gone up. I would say what

07:13.166 --> 07:18.338
Sunday's referendum does is it
gives them a very clear and
strong mandate to go back

07:18.338 --> 07:21.174
and to try and do something.

07:21.174 --> 07:25.578
MALCOLM BRABANT: Discussions
were also ongoing in Paris,
where German Chancellor Angela
Merkel

07:25.578 --> 07:29.649
met this evening with French
President Francois Hollande. An
emergency summit of Eurozone

07:29.649 --> 07:32.285
leaders convenes
tomorrow in Brussels.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.789
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through translator): We
respect the decision of

07:35.789 --> 07:40.560
the referendum as a vote of a
sovereign democratic state. And
now we have to deal with that

07:40.560 --> 07:45.598
decision. We're saying very
clearly that the door for talks
remains open. And tomorrow's

07:45.598 --> 07:48.468
meeting of the heads of states
belonging to the Eurozone ought
to be understood in that

07:48.468 --> 07:50.437
sense.

07:50.437 --> 07:53.239
MALCOLM BRABANT: And the
message from the White House
remained the same as before the

07:53.239 --> 07:56.609
vote: Negotiate a way to
remain in the Eurozone.

07:56.609 --> 08:00.213
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: The only way that
that will happen is to

08:00.213 --> 08:09.189
agree to a package of reforms
and financing that will allow
Greece to get back on a path

08:09.189 --> 08:16.196
of economic growth and debt
sustainability. That's the only
available resolution that

08:16.196 --> 08:20.266
is in the collective interests
of those in Europe who are
involved.

08:20.266 --> 08:25.372
MALCOLM BRABANT: But, back in
Greece, support to exit the
Eurozone was still a priority

08:25.372 --> 08:30.677
for many, including those of the
Socialist Workers Party
headquarters in a dingy Athenian

08:30.677 --> 08:34.848
street. They were packing away
the no posters and promising to
fight Tsipras' Syriza Party

08:34.848 --> 08:38.351
if he signs a bailout deal
that the people reject.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.389
PANOS GARGANOS, Socialist
Workers Party: If Syriza signs
a deal against the will of
people

08:42.389 --> 08:46.726
who voted no, it will be faced
with massive resistance.

08:46.726 --> 08:50.997
MALCOLM BRABANT: It wasn't just
the left that voted no in the
referendum. Alexis

08:50.997 --> 08:54.934
Mantheakis, formerly a senior
official with a right-wing
nationalist party, believes
Greece

08:54.934 --> 08:57.837
is now in a strong
negotiating position.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.274
ALEXIS MANTHEAKIS, Political
Analyst: If Greece is forced
into a corner and the banks

09:01.274 --> 09:06.546
are dried up, and they give us
no money, then the government
has the last resort of staying

09:06.546 --> 09:11.484
out of the euro, in which case I
think you will have a knock-on
effect of trillions of

09:11.484 --> 09:14.921
dollars lost. One-and-a-half
trillion was lost within months
with -- just in one day

09:14.921 --> 09:19.159
on the stock markets in the
referendum announcement.

09:19.159 --> 09:23.329
If we go out of the euro, that's
our last stick. We don't want
to use it. But if

09:23.329 --> 09:26.332
we're forced into a corner, I
think the government should do
it.

09:26.332 --> 09:29.969
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
uncertainty of what happens to
Greece and the euro wobbled
financial

09:29.969 --> 09:33.673
markets around the world today.
The dive was steadied by the
announcement that the

09:33.673 --> 09:37.710
Greek finance minister, Yanis
Varoufakis, would resign.

09:37.710 --> 09:42.148
For the time being, Greece
remains afloat financially,
Just. The European Central

09:42.148 --> 09:47.187
Bank has decided to maintain
what's called the emergency
liquidity assistance program

09:47.187 --> 09:51.891
to Greek banks, so that their
customers can continue to make
withdrawals. The banks

09:51.891 --> 09:55.128
were supposed to open tomorrow,
but will remain shuttered for at
least two more days. The

09:55.128 --> 09:59.065
maximum withdrawal is just $67.

09:59.065 --> 10:04.604
Without the ECB's helping hand,
Greek banks would have collapsed
within days. If Greek

10:04.604 --> 10:09.008
proposals fail to impress in
Brussels tomorrow, the E.U.
could decide to end its support,

10:09.008 --> 10:12.078
and Greece could really become
the poor man of Europe.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.982
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
is Malcolm Brabant in Athens.

10:15.982 --> 10:20.286
GWEN IFILL: As the government
braces for next steps, we turn
now to Greece's ambassador

10:20.286 --> 10:23.156
to Washington,
Christos Panagopoulos.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.724
Thank you so much for
joining us, Mr. Ambassador.

10:24.724 --> 10:25.692
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS, Greek
Ambassador to the United States:
Thanks for having me.

10:25.692 --> 10:28.695
GWEN IFILL: So, now, as you
look at what the voters said, no
to austerity, what do

10:28.695 --> 10:30.363
you think comes next?

10:30.363 --> 10:34.634
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS:
Next comes a euro summit.

10:34.634 --> 10:39.172
They're going to convene the
heads of government and the
states of the European Union
tomorrow.

10:39.172 --> 10:44.577
We will have a Eurogroup.
That's the procedure. But, in
substance, what the referendum
brought

10:44.577 --> 10:54.087
with this is unanimity of let's
say 80 percent of the parties
that represent the Greek
Parliament,

10:54.087 --> 10:58.925
which they support the prime
minister to go tomorrow to
Brussels and present a Greek
proposal.

10:58.925 --> 11:06.533
And we have reasons to hope that
we're going to reach an
agreement in principle, and then

11:06.533 --> 11:10.236
trying to renormalize the
country economically.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.306
GWEN IFILL: As you know, some
people think that unanimity that
you describe is going

11:13.306 --> 11:16.976
to take Greece off a cliff.
Why are they wrong?

11:16.976 --> 11:24.083
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS: Because
it's the first time since quite
a few months, I should

11:24.083 --> 11:32.725
say, that the political leaders
decided to back the government
to reach an agreement.

11:32.725 --> 11:38.431
And this is a very powerful
card. On the other hand, if you
look to our partners in

11:38.431 --> 11:45.238
Europe and also our American
partners, nobody has brought
anything if we fail to reach an

11:45.238 --> 11:50.543
agreement. The lenders -- let
me put it very simply -- they
are going to lose their

11:50.543 --> 11:52.679
money. And, of course, we're
going to suffer a lot, no
question about this, but who's
going

11:52.679 --> 11:55.214
to profit? No one.

11:55.214 --> 12:00.019
So, it's a win-win situation to
come down at the very last
moment and find agreement.

12:00.019 --> 12:03.189
And I think this is doable.

12:03.189 --> 12:09.162
GWEN IFILL: So, as you go to
make your appeal to the European
governments who are part of

12:09.162 --> 12:13.366
this, is there anything that
Greece is willing to give up, to
put on the table?

12:13.366 --> 12:18.271
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS: We have
a comprehensive proposal to
present, but, as I told you
before,

12:18.271 --> 12:23.209
the issue of the sustainability
of our debt is on the table.

12:23.209 --> 12:27.647
Why? We don't like to come back
after a few months discussing
about the Greek crisis.

12:27.647 --> 12:33.186
So, yes, we're ready to take
very tough measures. But, at
the same time, we should

12:33.186 --> 12:39.058
deal with the sustainability of
the debt, which is agreed back
in 2012, but was never

12:39.058 --> 12:41.260
implemented, the discussion.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.063
GWEN IFILL: In your opinion,
this will test the strength of
the Eurozone, not just of

12:44.063 --> 12:45.298
the government of Greece?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.300
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS:
It's another test.

12:47.300 --> 12:53.272
All the history of the European
Union is to find ways out of a
crisis after crisis and

12:53.272 --> 12:58.544
become stronger. That's our
hope, that through debate, with
difficulty, we're going to find

12:58.544 --> 13:04.917
our way out starting from
tomorrow and trying to normalize
back our country and the
Eurozone

13:04.917 --> 13:08.488
for the benefit of Europe and,
let me say, of the Western
community all in all.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.692
GWEN IFILL: What are the
chances that this leads to
Greece being forced or choosing
to

13:12.692 --> 13:16.195
exit the Eurozone? And will
that be a good thing for Greece?

13:16.195 --> 13:19.932
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS: Well,
when you go to a battle, you
don't ask starting about

13:19.932 --> 13:24.370
the failures, so we hope that
we're going to succeed to have.

13:24.370 --> 13:32.211
All the unanimity, with the one
exception of the parliamentary
parties, is to keep Greece

13:32.211 --> 13:36.049
in the Eurozone. And that's
what we hear from our partners
all over Europe, elected

13:36.049 --> 13:39.318
and not elected officials.

13:39.318 --> 13:45.124
Also, today, the White House
repeated its wish for a
compromise from both parties,
adding

13:45.124 --> 13:49.228
at the end that they should take
care of the sustainability of
the Greek debt, which is

13:49.228 --> 13:52.031
a big issue right
now on the table.

13:52.031 --> 13:56.035
GWEN IFILL: Bottom line, are
you as optimistic now as you
were, say, a few months ago that

13:56.035 --> 13:58.471
Greece is going to find a
way out of this muddle?

13:58.471 --> 14:02.909
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS: We are
as optimistic as ever because,
right now, it's the time

14:02.909 --> 14:07.513
to decide. We have no more
time. And, tomorrow, we're
going to see, I hope, positive

14:07.513 --> 14:09.549
results.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.784
GWEN IFILL: Christos
Panagopoulos, ambassador to the
United States from Greece, thank
you

14:11.784 --> 14:12.885
very much.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.921
CHRISTOS PANAGOPOULOS:
Thank you.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.490
GWEN IFILL: We turn now to a
look at the broader debate under
way in the wake of the

14:17.490 --> 14:19.859
Greek referendum.

14:19.859 --> 14:24.297
For that, we're joined by New
York Times columnist Paul
Krugman, who is also professor
of economics

14:24.297 --> 14:27.734
at the Graduate Center at the
City University of New York, and
Stephan Richter. He is

14:27.734 --> 14:31.204
publisher and editor in
chief of The Globalist.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.208
Stephan Richter, you just heard
that statement of optimism
coming from the Greek
ambassador.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.211
What do you think the fallout
is going to be from this vote
the weekend?

14:38.211 --> 14:42.014
STEPHAN RICHTER, The Globalist:
It's going to be severe, because
there have been lots

14:42.014 --> 14:46.018
of attempts, from Angela Merkel,
from the SPD in Germany, from
certainly the leader

14:46.018 --> 14:50.690
of Italy, France, and so on, to
build a bridge for Mr. Tsipras.

14:50.690 --> 14:55.461
Angela Merkel herself took him
basically under his -- wing, a
neophyte, a young politician.

14:55.461 --> 15:00.199
She wanted to build a bridge.
She risked a lot. But the
Greeks, basically, this
government

15:00.199 --> 15:05.104
has thrown away the belief of
others that, even if we had a
deal tomorrow, something

15:05.104 --> 15:10.376
magical happened, that it has
either the will or the capacity
to implement the agreement.

15:10.376 --> 15:14.080
As we know from many of these
agreements over time throughout
the world -- this is not just

15:14.080 --> 15:18.651
a Greece situation. Washington,
with the IMF, has dealt a lot of
conditionality and

15:18.651 --> 15:23.289
other things over the years.
Countries must be willing to
change in order to get to a

15:23.289 --> 15:26.559
brighter future. And it's not
about just opening banks and
throwing some money their

15:26.559 --> 15:29.929
way. That would be
nice if it were that.

15:29.929 --> 15:34.734
But the situation really is, if
you think all the euro crisis
away, Greece had problems

15:34.734 --> 15:39.405
before it got ever started in
the euro. Those problems are
still with us. And that's what

15:39.405 --> 15:42.341
it needs to rectify. And money
can't change that. It takes far
deeper change in Greece.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.745
GWEN IFILL: Paul Krugman?

15:45.745 --> 15:52.418
PAUL KRUGMAN, Columnist, The New
York Times: Well, I think one
thing that is really important

15:52.418 --> 15:57.356
to understand (AUDIO GAP) it has
raised taxes and slashed
spending to the tune of what
would

15:57.356 --> 16:01.060
be more than $2 trillion a year
if it was happening in the
United States.

16:01.060 --> 16:07.066
So, we're talking about a Greek
government that has under
successive leaders made enormous

16:07.066 --> 16:09.669
sacrifices. It's bizarre to
have people talking as if they
haven't done anything.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.239
They have done a lot of these
structural reforms as well.

16:13.239 --> 16:17.510
The problem is that what the
euro leaders, the Troika, had
been trying to done do is

16:17.510 --> 16:22.782
essentially impossible. When a
country is fairly deep in debt,
as Greece was, even at

16:22.782 --> 16:27.653
the beginning of this, though
it's worse now, to try to,
through austerity, bring that
debt

16:27.653 --> 16:32.225
under control, is
an impossible task.

16:32.225 --> 16:36.863
What you're doing is, you're
bashing the economy so badly
that the economy shrinks fast
than

16:36.863 --> 16:43.069
anything you can do on the
budget side. So, no,
essentially, Europe has been
completely

16:43.069 --> 16:46.639
living in a fantasy world on all
of this. I don't know what the
answer -- I mean,

16:46.639 --> 16:50.443
I suspect that the answer is
going to be Greek exit from the
euro. But the notion that

16:50.443 --> 16:53.980
Greeks have somehow failed to
deliver, after all the
incredible suffering they have
gone

16:53.980 --> 16:57.450
through, is just -- part of
the problem is that belief.

16:57.450 --> 17:02.255
GWEN IFILL: Stephan Richter, we
have seen today the IMF and the
European Central Bank

17:02.255 --> 17:05.992
and the Netherlands and Germany
all pretty much hold the line.
Do you think they hear

17:05.992 --> 17:08.661
what it is that Mr.
Krugman is talking about?

17:08.661 --> 17:11.998
STEPHAN RICHTER: No, because
the point he's making about debt
relief, and which he made

17:11.998 --> 17:16.235
in The New York Times today, is
really not what is at issue.

17:16.235 --> 17:20.206
I don't think there are many
German politicians or even
German citizens who are
expecting

17:20.206 --> 17:24.644
any money back out of Greece. I
think there was a big mess. The
German banks were in

17:24.644 --> 17:28.447
part faulty. Investment banks,
Goldman Sachs helped the Greek
government fake its statistics

17:28.447 --> 17:32.351
and so on. There's plenty
of blame to go around.

17:32.351 --> 17:36.989
Nobody expects money comes back
from Greece. But Greece has a
tradition of taking the

17:36.989 --> 17:41.727
concession and then not
delivering. When they got into
the euro, basically, the benefit

17:41.727 --> 17:45.698
was that Greece got much lower
interest rates, which helps an
economy, helps entrepreneurs

17:45.698 --> 17:49.769
to do business. But instead of
using it to improve their
economy, they basically used

17:49.769 --> 17:52.672
it to hire more
people in government.

17:52.672 --> 17:57.009
Every party packed the payrolls
of the government, and then they
were unelected, and the next

17:57.009 --> 18:01.580
team came in, the old guys
stayed. And this is not a way
to make Greece productive.
There

18:01.580 --> 18:05.751
are very many Greek productive
people. Unfortunately, many of
them live abroad, especially in
the

18:05.751 --> 18:10.656
United States. There is
entrepreneurship in Greece,
theoretically, but it's
basically

18:10.656 --> 18:13.559
voted with their
feet to move abroad.

18:13.559 --> 18:18.864
GWEN IFILL: Paul Krugman, are
these other nations in the
Eurozone, especially Germany,

18:18.864 --> 18:25.604
are they trying to make Greece
an example, for fear of the same
sort of instability spreading?

18:25.604 --> 18:34.547
PAUL KRUGMAN: Well, there is
some. That's speculation. We
don't really know that.

18:30.409 --> 18:35.781
It's hard not to suspect that.
The main right now is you have
to, is there -- if your

18:35.781 --> 18:39.552
notion is, well, Greek society
has always been corrupt, well,
you knew that. And it's

18:39.552 --> 18:44.690
not -- this is an impossible --
talk about mission creep, trying
to turn this from, let's

18:44.690 --> 18:48.461
deal with this financial
problem, let's deal with this
macroeconomic problem to let's
remake

18:48.461 --> 18:51.998
Greek society, that's saying
that you want Greece out.

18:51.998 --> 18:56.936
And then, if that actually
happens, Europe is going to be
very sorry, because the
consequences

18:56.936 --> 19:01.640
for the whole European system,
the consequences for the
European project will be
terrible.

19:01.640 --> 19:06.579
In the end, if Greece leaves
the euro, the consequences for
the Greeks will be a few

19:06.579 --> 19:11.083
months of chaos, but possibly a
big gain in competitiveness and
recovery.

19:11.083 --> 19:15.121
Remember, Greece functioned as
an economy before there was a
euro. The notion that

19:15.121 --> 19:21.627
they cannot survive without is
wrong. And the folly -- I mean,
I have no brief for the

19:21.627 --> 19:27.266
current government of Greece.
They are immature,
inexperienced. But compared
with the monstrous

19:27.266 --> 19:31.737
folly that's been repeated year
after year on the part of
Europe's leaders, it's nothing.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.774
This is an incredible
failure of judgment.

19:34.774 --> 19:38.744
GWEN IFILL: So, should the
Eurozone, Stephan Richter, go?
Should Greeks go from the
Eurozone

19:38.744 --> 19:41.714
or should the Eurozone
just cut Greece loose?

19:41.714 --> 19:45.718
STEPHAN RICHTER: The tragedy is
that the Greek case has shown
that in order to for

19:45.718 --> 19:51.791
the Eurozone to survive, there
needs to a minimum agreement on
fiscal policies, on lots

19:51.791 --> 19:56.128
of policies, and the Greek
government under any stripe --
this is not just a Syriza
problem

19:56.128 --> 19:59.365
-- is outside of that consensus.

19:59.365 --> 20:04.370
That's the tragedy. In order to
preserve the Eurozone, we will
see, in all likelihood,

20:04.370 --> 20:09.809
a Grexit, unless Mr. Tsipras
pulls one more rabbit out of his
hat, which is that he comes

20:09.809 --> 20:13.579
up with a unity government and
can say, this is no longer about
politics, we're all in

20:13.579 --> 20:16.715
this together. But that's a
very low probability. But
that's his last card.

20:16.715 --> 20:20.286
GWEN IFILL: Grexit means
Greek exit. I love that.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.088
But, Paul Krugman, what do you
think about that? Is there a
rabbit to be pulled out

20:22.088 --> 20:24.223
of the hat?

20:24.223 --> 20:27.426
PAUL KRUGMAN: Well, if we're
talking about unity government,
Greece has had a series

20:27.426 --> 20:29.595
of those, right?

20:29.595 --> 20:35.334
It has had a consensus. By and
large, it has done 90 percent,
95 percent of what the

20:35.334 --> 20:40.506
Troika told it to. And the
results have been catastrophic.
If that's the demand

20:40.506 --> 20:44.710
now, that once again Greece
sacrifice -- the current Greek
government sacrifice its own

20:44.710 --> 20:48.714
principles, go back on what it
promised the electorate, this
time it's really going to

20:48.714 --> 20:50.850
work, well, I don't think you're
going to blame Greece for the
consequences, if that

20:50.850 --> 20:52.551
what happens.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.121
GWEN IFILL: Paul Krugman of The
New York Times and Stephan
Richter of The Globalist,

20:55.121 --> 20:56.622
thank you both very much.

20:56.622 --> 21:00.759
STEPHAN RICHTER: Thank you.

21:00.759 --> 21:06.365
PAUL KRUGMAN: Thank you.

21:06.365 --> 21:13.739
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. women's
soccer team set itself apart
last night with a historic

21:13.739 --> 21:13.906
achievement. We're about to
look at what this outcome means,
and the state of women's

21:13.906 --> 21:15.274
sports vs. men's.

21:15.274 --> 21:14.406
But, first, we're not yet 24
hours from our victory in
Vancouver, a quick look back.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.107
MAN: The U.S. wins the
2015 women's World Cup!

21:15.107 --> 21:15.307
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a
record-breaking victory, and it
came in decisive fashion.

21:15.307 --> 21:14.440
The Americans beat defending
champion Japan 5-to-2, avenging
their 2011 loss in the finals,

21:14.440 --> 21:14.440
and winning their first
World Cup since 1999.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.207
Midfielder Carli Lloyd
scored three times,

21:15.207 --> 21:14.039
a first in a women's final, and
the U.S. had a 4-0 lead within
the first 16 minutes.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.174
MAN: Hat trick for Lloyd!

21:15.174 --> 21:13.672
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lloyd, who won
player of the tournament
honors,said the team just wrote

21:13.672 --> 21:15.274
history.

21:15.274 --> 21:15.274
CARLI LLOYD, U.S. Women's
National Team: I'm so proud of
this group. We have executed

21:15.274 --> 21:13.672
our game plan each and every
game. And to make it to the
final, to win 5-2, unbelievable

21:13.672 --> 21:15.174
moment.

21:15.174 --> 21:13.672
JUDY WOODRUFF: Afterwards, head
coach Jill Ellis reflected on
the sooner-than-expected

21:13.672 --> 21:15.474
success.

21:15.474 --> 21:15.274
JILL ELLIS, Head Coach, U.S.
Women's National Team: We
talked about trying to start
fast.

21:15.274 --> 21:13.806
And that's been one of our
mantras, start fast, finish
strong. And I mean, they came

21:13.806 --> 21:15.274
out of the gate.

21:15.274 --> 21:15.508
JUDY WOODRUFF: A sellout crowd
of more than 53,000, including
Vice President Joe Biden,

21:15.508 --> 21:14.607
was on hand in Vancouver. And
back in the U.S., the final
posted the highest
metered-market

21:14.607 --> 21:15.307
TV rating ever for soccer
game on a single network.

21:15.307 --> 21:15.174
The Americans now have three
women's World Cup titles, more
than any other country. And

21:15.174 --> 21:15.307
today, in turn, they received
uniforms with a coveted third
star on the chest.

21:15.307 --> 21:15.307
But despite the celebrating,
there was criticism surrounding
disparities for women playing

21:15.307 --> 21:15.274
in the World Cup. Unlike the
men's tournament, the women were
forced to play on artificial

21:15.274 --> 21:14.673
turf, a surface that's been
blamed for injuries and unusual
bounces. American fan favorite

21:14.673 --> 21:15.274
Abby Wambach was among the most
vocal critics of the fake grass.

21:15.274 --> 21:15.141
Another issue: the World Cup
prize money. When Germany won
the men's tournament last

21:15.141 --> 21:15.174
year, it took home $35 million.
But the U.S. women won only $2
million this year.

21:15.174 --> 21:20.112
What does this win mean for the
future of women's professional
soccer in the U.S.?

21:20.112 --> 21:25.184
We turn to Cheryl Cooky, a
professor of women's studies at
Purdue University, who has
published

21:25.184 --> 21:30.789
studies on the differences
between the way men's and
women's sports are seen. And
Deborah

21:30.789 --> 21:35.995
Slaner Larkin is the CEO of the
Women's Sports Foundation, which
works toward safe and equitable

21:35.995 --> 21:38.664
sports opportunities
for girls and women.

21:38.664 --> 21:41.567
And we welcome you both.

21:41.567 --> 21:44.703
Deborah Larkin, to you first.
How big a deal is this women's
World Cup?

21:44.703 --> 21:48.007
DEBORAH SLANER LARKIN, CEO,
Women's Sports Foundation:
Well, it's a huge deal.

21:48.007 --> 21:54.413
This really started from 1999,
when we won the second World
Cup, and the next generation

21:54.413 --> 22:00.653
of girls who looked up to those
stars are playing today, so it's
not only those athletes,

22:00.653 --> 22:04.723
but it's the next generation of
girls and boys in all sports who
want to play.

22:04.723 --> 22:08.227
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cheryl Cooky,
how do you see the significance
of it?

22:08.227 --> 22:12.765
CHERYL COOKY, Purdue University:
I think of this as a tremendous
moment, not only for

22:12.765 --> 22:19.505
the U.S. women's soccer team,
but for all those fans out
there, all the aspiring young

22:19.505 --> 22:24.843
girls and boys who want to be
athletes. I think this is a
tremendous moment for them.

22:24.843 --> 22:29.415
I think it's a tremendous moment
for our culture as well, that we
can all join together and

22:29.415 --> 22:35.287
celebrate the tremendous
accomplishments and prowess in
female athleticism that we saw

22:35.287 --> 22:38.490
displayed last night.

22:38.490 --> 22:42.761
JUDY WOODRUFF: Deborah Larkin,
we mentioned the disparity
between men's and women's
soccer.

22:42.761 --> 22:48.334
How much disparity
is there today?

22:48.334 --> 23:08.621
DEBORAH SLANER LARKIN: Oh, it's
(AUDIO GAP) is much more
difficult to play on, and the

23:08.621 --> 23:12.925
men do not have to
play on a turf field.

23:12.925 --> 23:18.397
And so while they play the same
amount of time with the same
amount of energy, the
temperatures

23:18.397 --> 23:27.239
on a turf field are much, much
hotter. So it's very dramatic,
what the differences are.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.510
I kind of likened it to when we
used to talk about that when
Fred Astaire and Ginger

23:31.510 --> 23:35.648
Rogers would dance, Ginger
Rogers had to do it going
backwards and in heels. That's

23:35.648 --> 23:37.683
the difference.

23:37.683 --> 23:42.488
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cheryl Cooky,
what would you add to that? And
why is this disparity

23:42.488 --> 23:47.226
still there more than 40 years
after Title IX, the federal law,
was passed outlawing

23:47.226 --> 23:50.996
discrimination on the basis
of gender in education?

23:50.996 --> 23:58.404
CHERYL COOKY: Just to add to
that, I think it's interesting
to look at the media coverage.

23:58.404 --> 24:04.009
The Major League soccer -- men's
soccer league in the United
States just recently signed

24:04.009 --> 24:10.983
an eight-year $90 million
contract with a major sports
network, ESPN and FOX Sports,

24:10.983 --> 24:16.722
to have their games televised,
whereas the National Women's
Soccer League, the female

24:16.722 --> 24:20.826
counterpart, has no TV contract,
has only three sponsors,
compared to the 20 sponsors

24:20.826 --> 24:23.629
for the men's team.

24:23.629 --> 24:29.868
And we know that the MLS
professional league has
struggled in terms of generating
revenue

24:29.868 --> 24:35.374
and generating a fan base. So,
I think the lack of a national
contract for the women's

24:35.374 --> 24:41.146
team really does impact how we
can really come to know women's
sports -- or women's

24:41.146 --> 24:44.917
soccer, I should say,
in the United States.

24:44.917 --> 24:49.088
How this all connects to Title
IX, I think, is a really
interesting question. We have

24:49.088 --> 24:53.792
seen a tremendous growth and
explosion in the number of girls
and women that are participating

24:53.792 --> 24:59.765
in sports. However, there are
still a number of areas -- and
we were talking about media

24:59.765 --> 25:04.069
and sponsorship and those sorts
of issues -- there's a number of
ways in which women's

25:04.069 --> 25:07.639
sports, both at the high school,
collegiate level, as well as the
professional level,

25:07.639 --> 25:10.642
still suffer from
these disparities.

25:10.642 --> 25:15.748
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me --
Deborah Larkin, let me turn to
you on that, not only why they

25:15.748 --> 25:20.953
still exist, but what can be
done about it? We are decades
past this -- again, the passage

25:20.953 --> 25:26.058
of this law. What needs to
happen for there to be more of a
-- not to abuse the term -- but

25:26.058 --> 25:28.026
for there to be more of
an even playing field?

25:28.026 --> 25:30.195
DEBORAH SLANER LARKIN:
That's right.

25:30.195 --> 25:34.700
Well, we really have to put
teeth into the law when we talk
about compliance of Title

25:34.700 --> 25:40.639
IX. In high school sports, when
Title IX was first passed, one
in 27 girls played sports.

25:40.639 --> 25:44.710
Now the number we
use is two in five.

25:44.710 --> 25:49.415
But I'm going to talk about it
in a different way. A third of
the girls who play are getting

25:49.415 --> 25:55.220
all the kind of exercise in
sports they need. A third get a
little. And a third get

25:55.220 --> 26:00.592
none. And it's the third that
get none and a little are who we
need to focus on, because

26:00.592 --> 26:05.164
they're not getting the
education, health and leadership
benefits.

26:05.164 --> 26:12.004
Girls who play sports do better
in school, have aspirations for
college, earn more money

26:12.004 --> 26:18.277
in the work force, are less
involved in delinquent
behaviors. So we need to put
our money where

26:18.277 --> 26:24.850
our mouth is and put money
behind girls sports and
compliance for Title IX.

26:24.850 --> 26:29.188
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cheryl Cooky,
how do you see this question of
girls and women not having

26:29.188 --> 26:33.325
the same opportunity as men when
it comes to participate in
sports?

26:33.325 --> 26:40.632
CHERYL COOKY: Yes, I think
there's a lot of ways in which
there are still many types

26:40.632 --> 26:43.769
of inequalities, some that we
can see and some that we can't,
some that we're aware

26:43.769 --> 26:46.772
of and some that we're not.

26:46.772 --> 26:53.245
If we look at simple things like
when sports are played,the NBA,
the professional league

26:53.245 --> 26:56.715
-- and, of course, this isn't
applying to Title IX, but we see
this at the high school

26:56.715 --> 27:03.088
and the collegiate levels.
Oftentimes, the men's teams play
in the high profile, the

27:03.088 --> 27:08.160
regular season. The girls and
women's teams oftentimes play in
off-seasons. They have

27:08.160 --> 27:12.030
the less desirable playing time.

27:12.030 --> 27:17.135
So I think that there's these
kinds of subtleties that are
just beyond getting more girls
involved

27:17.135 --> 27:19.204
in sports.

27:19.204 --> 27:23.075
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this big
win for USA women's soccer
certainly gives us an
opportunity

27:23.075 --> 27:26.411
to look at these issues again.

27:26.411 --> 27:30.015
And we want to thank both of you
for talking with us. Cheryl
Cooky, Deborah Slaner Larkin,

27:30.015 --> 27:31.283
we appreciate it.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.384
DEBORAH SLANER
LARKIN: Thank you.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.754
CHERYL COOKY: Thank
you very much.

27:35.754 --> 27:46.298
GWEN IFILL: Fourth of July
brought parades, patriotism and
even a few fireworks to the

27:46.298 --> 27:49.067
campaign trail.

27:49.067 --> 27:54.306
No better time, then, for
Politics Monday, our weekly look
at the state of the campaign.

27:54.306 --> 27:58.777
Joining me tonight, Tamara Keith
of NPR and Susan Page of USA
Today.

27:58.777 --> 28:02.948
Ladies, let's follow the money.
Let's talk about what some of
these candidates have said

28:02.948 --> 28:07.452
they have been raising. We see
that in the three-month period
that people have been measuring,

28:07.452 --> 28:12.858
Hillary Clinton says she's
raised $45 million, Bernie
Sanders in that same period of
time,

28:12.858 --> 28:17.896
for someone who has not taken as
being a real challenge to her on
some levels, $15 million,

28:17.896 --> 28:23.502
Ted Cruz $14 million, and Ben
Carson $8.3 million, which is
also not chicken feed.

28:23.502 --> 28:26.438
So, where is all this money
coming from and from whom?

28:26.438 --> 28:29.274
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well, for Hillary
Clinton, it's coming from a mix.

28:29.274 --> 28:35.714
She has been doing a lot of
big-dollar fund-raisers, about
$2,700 fund-raisers per head.
That's

28:35.714 --> 28:40.586
the max that someone could get
for the primary. She's done
these like three, four
fund-raisers

28:40.586 --> 28:44.890
a day, where if you add it up
it's something like $1 million
in a single day.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.259
At the same time, she's
also been trying to

28:47.259 --> 28:53.398
get a lot of small donors, and
when this number came out, her
campaign was careful to say,

28:53.398 --> 28:57.002
and look at this; 91 percent of
our donations were for $100 or
less. They definitely want

28:57.002 --> 28:59.838
to promote the lower number.

28:59.838 --> 29:05.310
Bernie Sanders, he isn't having
any big-dollar fund-raisers and
his campaign is very proud

29:05.310 --> 29:09.648
that the average donation is
something like $33. And it's
pretty remarkable to raise

29:09.648 --> 29:12.751
$15 million $33 at a time.

29:12.751 --> 29:17.456
GWEN IFILL: I'm also interested
that a lot of candidates,
including Ted Cruz, who, even

29:17.456 --> 29:22.628
though he raised $14 million,
put out a statement that he --
that plus his uncoordinated --
uncoordinated

29:22.628 --> 29:26.632
PAC has actually -- political
action committee -- has actually
raised a lot more.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.501
How much are these candidates
informally depending on the
PACs?

29:29.501 --> 29:31.303
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today: Well, a lot.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.373
And even though we're breaking
records here, Hillary Clinton
broke the record that Barack

29:34.373 --> 29:39.177
Obama set in the 2016 campaign
for first-quarter fund-raising,
$45 million. That is going

29:39.177 --> 29:43.248
to be dwarfed by what Hillary
Clinton-related super PACs and
PACs are going to be raising

29:43.248 --> 29:45.951
and spending on her behalf.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.287
And they're not supposed to be
coordinated. It's interesting
that Ted Cruz felt free

29:49.287 --> 29:54.926
to cite that as part of his
total, not illegal, but it does
give the lie to the technical

29:54.926 --> 29:58.430
rule that they're supposed to be
uncoordinated. In fact, they're
staffed by the people who

29:58.430 --> 30:02.467
used to work for the candidates.
There is all kinds of
relationships there that they

30:02.467 --> 30:02.934
can count on.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.936
GWEN IFILL: OK.

30:04.936 --> 30:07.506
Let's talk about the squeeze
from the right and the left,
especially starting with the

30:07.506 --> 30:11.043
Democratic side. On the right,
we have Jim Webb getting into
the race and basically running

30:11.043 --> 30:15.347
to the right of Hillary Clinton.
And we have Bernie Sanders, who
is attracting huge

30:15.347 --> 30:18.984
crowds running to the left of
Hillary Clinton, and near as we
can tell. Is this having

30:18.984 --> 30:20.886
an effect on Hillary Clinton?

30:20.886 --> 30:22.788
TAMARA KEITH: I think that what
Hillary Clinton would say is
that she's continuing

30:22.788 --> 30:25.991
to run her own race.

30:25.991 --> 30:30.462
And if you look at what she's
doing -- tomorrow, she's doing
an interview on CNN. This will

30:30.462 --> 30:35.867
be her first sit-down televised
interview, national televised
interview of this campaign.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.937
Her campaign had told us a
couple of months ago that they
were planning to start rolling

30:38.937 --> 30:41.239
these interviews out
over the summer.

30:41.239 --> 30:48.013
So even things that seem like it
might be like she's running
scared, actually, it all

30:48.013 --> 30:50.248
seems to be part of their
playbook. It doesn't seem like
they have changed the playbook
just

30:50.248 --> 30:51.016
yet.

30:51.016 --> 30:51.550
GWEN IFILL: What
about that, Susan?

30:51.550 --> 30:54.619
SUSAN PAGE: I think
that they're concerned.

30:54.619 --> 30:59.224
And I think they're concerned
because, number one, not so much
that Bernie Sanders is going

30:59.224 --> 31:02.461
to take the nomination away from
her. I think that's extremely
unlikely. He is getting

31:02.461 --> 31:07.399
these huge crowds. And he's got
a message that is resonating
with a lot of Democrats.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.869
It's a more liberal message, a
more progressive message than
she would naturally articulate.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.272
That is putting pressure on her
on things like the free trade
pact.

31:14.272 --> 31:19.444
And, also, his manner. She has
got all kinds of problems in
looking approachable and looking

31:19.444 --> 31:25.817
like she's a fully-fledged human
being. And he's all -- he's
just totally approachable.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.754
He's 100 percent authentic,
approachable Bernie Sanders. So
I think the contrast

31:28.754 --> 31:29.755
is not helpful to her.

31:29.755 --> 31:30.222
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.290
GWEN IFILL: Go ahead.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.494
TAMARA KEITH: I was just going
to say that when I talk to
people out when I'm reporting,

31:35.494 --> 31:40.132
they say things like, gosh,
Bernie Sanders is just so real.

31:40.132 --> 31:45.470
And it creates that contrast
with Hillary Clinton, who has
been in public life for so

31:45.470 --> 31:50.475
long. She's had her picture
taken so many times that she has
that smile down just right.

31:50.475 --> 31:54.780
And Bernie is just out there
being Bernie. And so it does
create sort of a stylistic

31:54.780 --> 31:56.948
contrast for people.

31:56.948 --> 32:00.986
GWEN IFILL: On the Republican
side, the pressure, the squeeze
seems to be brought

32:00.986 --> 32:06.625
on Republican candidates by one
Donald Trump, who, because of
what he said in his announcement

32:06.625 --> 32:11.062
about Mexicans and many of them
being rapists, even though he's
sure some of them are OK,

32:11.062 --> 32:15.734
has put a lot of Republican
candidates into the position of
having to respond, denounce,

32:15.734 --> 32:17.936
distance themselves?

32:17.936 --> 32:23.942
SUSAN PAGE: But not that eager
to do so, because the fact is
Donald Trump has a message

32:23.942 --> 32:28.380
that appeals to some Republican
voters with a very hard line on
immigration.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.484
It took a while. It took a week
for other Republican candidates
to come out and to be

32:32.484 --> 32:37.622
critical of him, even though
this is very bad news, I think,
for the Republican Party

32:37.622 --> 32:41.459
in a general election. The
Republicans will not win the
White House unless they do
better

32:41.459 --> 32:45.330
among Hispanic voters than Mitt
Romney did. And they are not
going to do better among

32:45.330 --> 32:49.501
Hispanic voters if they have a
line on immigration that is
offensive to so many Hispanics.

32:49.501 --> 32:53.338
GWEN IFILL: How difficult --
for instance, Jeb Bush came out
today and said he found

32:53.338 --> 32:56.842
it offensive. He's married to a
woman who was born in Mexico.
And Donald Trump's response

32:56.842 --> 32:58.109
was, well, he had to do
that because of his wife.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.578
Which...

32:59.578 --> 33:01.146
TAMARA KEITH: Well, Donald
Trump has deleted that tweet.

33:01.146 --> 33:01.746
(CROSSTALK)

33:01.746 --> 33:02.380
GWEN IFILL: Did he really?

33:02.380 --> 33:04.516
TAMARA KEITH: He did.

33:04.516 --> 33:09.120
I think, in some ways, Donald
Trump is the ultimate Twitter
troll, and a lot of these

33:09.120 --> 33:13.158
candidates were trying not to
feed the troll for a while. And
then they realized, oh,

33:13.158 --> 33:19.531
wait, he is saying things
that are damaging.

33:19.531 --> 33:24.069
And so, Jeb Bush came out
relatively early, though, fact
is Donald Trump made these
remarks

33:24.069 --> 33:26.972
June 16. It is now July 6 -- 7.

33:26.972 --> 33:27.873
GWEN IFILL: Took a long time.

33:27.873 --> 33:31.309
TAMARA KEITH: It took
a very long time.

33:31.309 --> 33:36.615
But Jeb Bush did ultimately,
Marco Rubio, several other
candidates. Ted Cruz is the

33:36.615 --> 33:39.718
only one who said he didn't want
to get involved in this
Republican-on-Republican
fighting.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.254
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

33:42.254 --> 33:47.292
Well, the other interesting
thing this and other things do
is make candidates like Chris

33:47.292 --> 33:51.263
Christie, who was once
considered to be the moderate in
this race, and Scott Walker,
considered

33:51.263 --> 33:54.432
to be social conservative,
they're not necessarily exactly
where they started out, are
they?

33:54.432 --> 33:57.669
SUSAN PAGE: Well, Chris
Christie has now a very narrow
path ahead of him.

33:57.669 --> 34:01.539
And you saw him go straight to
New Hampshire after his
announcement, because that New
Hampshire

34:01.539 --> 34:05.110
straight talk express, that is
what he's hoping to get on. He
has got a tough road ahead

34:05.110 --> 34:07.178
of him.

34:07.178 --> 34:10.682
Scott Walker, it's interesting,
because he has made a good early
impression. But his

34:10.682 --> 34:15.287
chips are all in Iowa. He needs
to win. If Chris Christie has
to win in New Hampshire,

34:15.287 --> 34:18.790
Scott Walker has to win in Iowa.
And we know that social
conservatives, evangelical

34:18.790 --> 34:21.793
voters are a really powerful
part of the Iowa caucuses.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.029
GWEN IFILL: Fifteen
seconds on Scott Walker.

34:24.029 --> 34:27.132
TAMARA KEITH: The interesting
thing about Scott Walker is that
when he was running for

34:27.132 --> 34:32.504
reelection in Wisconsin, he was
all about, I can be a blue state
governor.

34:32.504 --> 34:39.077
Now he's running in Iowa, needs
to win Iowa. And his preacher's
son, social conservative

34:39.077 --> 34:42.681
side is coming out more than it
did in that reelection not that
long ago.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.883
GWEN IFILL: Candidate's got to
do what a candidate's got to do.

34:44.883 --> 34:48.053
Tamara Keith and Susan Page,
thank you both very much.

34:48.053 --> 34:51.323
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

34:51.323 --> 34:55.694
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

34:55.694 --> 35:04.302
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: What a
long, strange trip it's been.
After 50 years, the legendary

35:04.302 --> 35:09.607
rock band the Grateful Dead
bowed out in a series of
concerts this weekend. There
was

35:09.607 --> 35:14.245
history, some controversy, and a
whole lot more in the air. And
it was, no surprise,

35:14.245 --> 35:16.214
one of the summer's
toughest tickets.

35:16.214 --> 35:19.150
Our Jeffrey Brown was there.

35:19.150 --> 35:33.431
JEFFREY BROWN: It was a weekend
of extended guitar solos,
era-evoking sounds, and "High

35:33.431 --> 35:42.907
Times" images updated into
the digital graphics age.

35:42.907 --> 35:46.177
There were good vibes of the
multigenerational time.

35:46.177 --> 35:49.681
MAN: It's the last show. We
have got to see it. I have got
to pass that on to him.

35:49.681 --> 35:52.317
JEFFREY BROWN: And a certain
amount of nostalgia, including
from band members looking back
50

35:52.317 --> 35:54.052
years.

35:54.052 --> 35:58.223
BILL KREUTZMANN, Grateful Dead:
We were just really gung-ho,
wanting to play. And

35:58.223 --> 36:01.292
that's what -- that's how you
feel about every day. Any day
you had a chance to play music,

36:01.292 --> 36:03.528
you got together and played.

36:03.528 --> 36:06.564
JEFFREY BROWN: It was all part
of a major happening that played
out over three days

36:06.564 --> 36:09.067
and into long nights.

36:09.067 --> 36:14.672
It's called "Fare Thee Well," a
series of final concerts for a
band that blazed its

36:14.672 --> 36:19.711
own path on the way to becoming
part of rock 'n' roll history.
We got here to Soldier

36:19.711 --> 36:22.981
Field in Chicago ahead of the
celebration to talk to some of
the people who are putting

36:22.981 --> 36:25.417
it on and taking part.

36:25.417 --> 36:29.054
PETER SHAPIRO, Music Promoter:
It's going to be a big -- it's a
big circus.

36:29.054 --> 36:29.421
JEFFREY BROWN: A big circus?

36:29.421 --> 36:31.523
(LAUGHTER)

36:31.523 --> 36:35.493
PETER SHAPIRO: Yes, because
there's so much going on.
Listen, it's driven by the
ringmaster

36:35.493 --> 36:40.365
in the middle, which is the
band. And the music is the real
thing.

36:40.365 --> 36:44.102
JEFFREY BROWN: Music promoter
Peter Shapiro put the event
together.

36:44.102 --> 36:47.338
PETER SHAPIRO: Part of the
energy is the people. You will
see lots of spectacle.

36:47.338 --> 36:52.410
So, all these different people
from all over America, from all
these different age

36:52.410 --> 36:54.979
groups, you will feel it, you
can feel it, you know, and you
can't get that anywhere

36:54.979 --> 36:56.748
else.

36:56.748 --> 37:02.320
There's just no other scene.
That's why I think this sold out
in a minute, 200,000

37:02.320 --> 37:05.623
tickets. And people are dying
-- they want -- they want to
also go back in time a bit.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.691
JEFFREY BROWN: You think so?

37:06.691 --> 37:07.392
PETER SHAPIRO: Yes,
I think it's...

37:07.392 --> 37:08.493
JEFFREY BROWN: To what?

37:08.493 --> 37:10.128
PETER SHAPIRO: To
a better time.

37:10.128 --> 37:15.700
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, at
least to a different time.

37:15.700 --> 37:21.372
Grateful Dead helped to define
the '60s era counterculture, its
freedom, its excess, the

37:21.372 --> 37:26.444
whole package. All these years
later, drummer Bill Kreutzmann
told me of the first time

37:26.444 --> 37:33.618
he saw a performance by a young
man who would become the band's
most iconic figure, charismatic

37:33.618 --> 37:35.787
guitarist Jerry Garcia.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.990
BILL KREUTZMANN: Got as close
as we are right now, and I
watched him and I said, I'm

37:38.990 --> 37:42.227
going to follow him forever just
to myself. And then about...

37:42.227 --> 37:44.028
JEFFREY BROWN: But what was it
that you saw in him, that you
saw that made you say

37:44.028 --> 37:45.830
that?

37:45.830 --> 37:48.900
BILL KREUTZMANN: I saw magic
that you don't see in everyday
people. I saw the excitement

37:48.900 --> 37:54.539
of life inside of him
just coming forth.

37:54.539 --> 38:01.012
JEFFREY BROWN: A lot of people
saw the magic in Garcia and the
band, the beginnings of

38:01.012 --> 38:05.083
a cultlike following called Dead
Heads, fans who followed the
band from concert to concert

38:05.083 --> 38:06.851
through the years.

38:06.851 --> 38:10.021
GREG KOT, The Chicago Tribune:
I think the Grateful Dead were a
social phenomenon as

38:10.021 --> 38:15.126
much as a musical phenomenon,
and that the combination made
them truly unique in rock

38:15.126 --> 38:17.629
history. I don't there's ever
been a band quite like them.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.732
JEFFREY BROWN: Greg Kot is
music critic for The Chicago
Tribune.

38:20.732 --> 38:24.636
GREG KOT: It was a caravan. It
wasn't just a band. It was
about the band and the

38:24.636 --> 38:28.039
fans. Most bands, when they go
out on tour, they basically
establish a set list and play

38:28.039 --> 38:31.509
the same songs in the
same order every night.

38:31.509 --> 38:35.513
The Grateful Dead never played
the same songs in the same
order, much less even in the
same

38:35.513 --> 38:41.586
way. They reinterpreted their
catalogue constantly, so every
show was different.

38:41.586 --> 38:46.858
JEFFREY BROWN: Also different
and ahead of its time, what you
could call the band's

38:46.858 --> 38:52.297
business mode, one based on
constant performing and
direct-to-consumer interaction,
including

38:52.297 --> 38:56.000
encouraging fans to make
and share free recordings.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.571
GREG KOT: There was no
middleman. They presaged the
Internet era in a lot of ways.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.606
They were an Internet band
without the existence of the
Internet.

39:01.606 --> 39:04.475
JEFFREY BROWN: How many
shows have you gone to?

39:04.475 --> 39:06.411
MAN: I have gone to
98. Tonight is 99.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.946
(CROSSTALK)

39:07.946 --> 39:11.482
MAN: I got tickets -- I just
got tickets for 99.
Ninety-nine!

39:11.482 --> 39:16.554
JEFFREY BROWN: That sense of
belonging to a community was on
display in the pre-concert

39:16.554 --> 39:22.794
parking lot scene in Chicago, a
colorful festival of tie-dye and
T-shirts, often worn as proud

39:22.794 --> 39:30.468
emblems of attendance at
Dead concerts of the past.

39:30.468 --> 39:33.805
Many here were too young to have
taken part in the golden age of
the Dead, but they, too,

39:33.805 --> 39:36.574
wanted to be part of the scene.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.911
WOMAN: When else in my life
would I have the chance to see
something like this? It's

39:39.911 --> 39:43.114
like really rare for
someone of my age.

39:43.114 --> 00:00.033
JEFFREY BROWN: That golden age
was wonderful for the band and
its followers, until it wasn't.

39:49.721 --> 39:54.092
Jerry Garcia died in 1995 of a
heart attack after years of
battling drug addiction. He

39:54.092 --> 39:57.595
was just 53.

39:57.595 --> 40:01.132
In his new memoir, "Deal,"
drummer Bill Kreutzmann writes
of the band's many highs and how
they

40:01.132 --> 40:03.801
led to serious lows.

40:03.801 --> 40:06.671
BILL KREUTZMANN: The drugs
played the worst, the baddest
part of that.

40:06.671 --> 40:09.340
JEFFREY BROWN: What
did it do to the band?

40:09.340 --> 40:13.778
BILL KREUTZMANN: It made us all
individuals. It made us feel
self-centered. It made

40:13.778 --> 40:21.686
us not listen to music when we
were all playing together. It's
just really bad for music.

40:21.686 --> 40:28.059
JEFFREY BROWN: Money also
became a factor, says
Kreutzmann, the need for it to
support

40:28.059 --> 40:33.364
what inevitably became more
corporate entity than just a
group of young music-loving
guys.

40:33.364 --> 40:38.636
BILL KREUTZMANN: The purity of
it may have run its length, but
it still would come back

40:38.636 --> 40:43.508
at times. It just -- it took a
lot more work when it went to
the dark side. But

40:43.508 --> 40:46.444
we managed. And that's another
reason why we're here now doing
this. We're all back.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.113
We're all healthy again.

40:49.113 --> 40:55.720
JEFFREY BROWN: Why exactly they
are back has been a question,
though.

40:55.720 --> 41:02.860
Original band members
Kreutzmann, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh,
and Mickey Hart, ages 67 to 75,

41:02.860 --> 41:07.131
took the stage with help from
younger stars, including Trey
Anastasio of Phish, one of

41:07.131 --> 41:11.602
the many so-called jam bands
spawned by the Grateful Dead.

41:11.602 --> 41:18.476
In the run-up to these concerts,
even many old-time fans had
grumbled about ticket prices,

41:18.476 --> 41:23.748
availability and much more. Two
more concerts on the West Coast
were added to help meet

41:23.748 --> 41:26.384
the demand.

41:26.384 --> 41:35.059
GREG KOT: If they leave at this
and this is their going-away
party, I think everybody

41:35.059 --> 41:37.428
will say, well, they
earned that weekend.

41:37.428 --> 41:42.867
But if they extend this out and
it turns into a big cash-out
tour after this, I will be

41:42.867 --> 41:48.773
-- and I -- I think I speak for
a lot of Dead Heads -- that will
be disappointing to see

41:48.773 --> 41:51.309
them go out that way. So, it
will be interesting to see how
they handle this weekend.

41:51.309 --> 41:54.345
JEFFREY BROWN: Is this really
the end of the Grateful Dead?

41:54.345 --> 41:55.747
BILL KREUTZMANN: As far as I
know. I haven't seen any more
shows...

41:55.747 --> 41:56.848
(CROSSTALK)

41:56.848 --> 41:59.150
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're
hedging a little bit?

41:59.150 --> 42:01.953
BILL KREUTZMANN: Well, I --
because -- I will tell why I
hedge. You're very sensitive.

42:01.953 --> 42:04.989
You picked that up right away.

42:04.989 --> 42:12.163
I would like it to do -- to do
it more. Between you and me and
all your lovely fans, I would

42:12.163 --> 42:15.867
like to have a couple more
shows on the East Coast.

42:15.867 --> 42:25.009
JEFFREY BROWN: So, who knows.
We were there, and it was an
event, all right, music,

42:25.009 --> 42:31.082
lights, 70,000 of the band's
closest friends soaking up a
remembrance of times past, for

42:31.082 --> 42:34.986
one more weekend, at least,
the Dead very much alive.

42:34.986 --> 42:39.590
From Soldier Field in Chicago,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

42:39.590 --> 42:47.532
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whether you're a
Dead Head or not, the fun
continues online, where you

42:47.532 --> 42:51.569
can watch Jeff's full interview
with founding member Bill
Kreutzmann. Plus, read Jeff's

42:51.569 --> 42:56.741
reporter's notebook about what
it was like covering the scene.

42:56.741 --> 43:07.718
GWEN IFILL: Finally
tonight, Americans have

43:07.718 --> 43:12.390
long crossed the border with
Mexico in search of cheaper
medical procedures, dental work

43:12.390 --> 43:16.394
and prescription drugs. Now a
new trend is afoot: finding a
place to live out retirement

43:16.394 --> 43:18.863
years.

43:18.863 --> 43:21.432
Special correspondent Kathleen
McCleery has the story, part of
our occasional series about

43:21.432 --> 43:25.803
long-term care.

43:25.803 --> 43:36.280
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: David Truly,
known as the Barefoot Professor,
plays in a local band

43:36.280 --> 43:40.551
near Lake Chapala in Central
Mexico. He wrote his Ph.D.
dissertation on the migration

43:40.551 --> 43:43.421
of retirees to this area.

43:43.421 --> 43:45.890
DAVID TRULY, Autonomous
University of Guadalajara: Kind
of a range between maybe 8,000
to about

43:45.890 --> 43:51.762
15,000, 16,000 full-timers, and
then -- but, in the winter, it
can blow up in just this

43:51.762 --> 43:54.599
community to maybe 30,000.

43:54.599 --> 43:59.804
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Mexico's
largest lake is surrounded by
emerald green mountains.

43:59.804 --> 44:04.475
The village of Ajijic draws
artists and writers.
Cobblestone streets are dotted

44:04.475 --> 44:08.813
with galleries and restaurants
serving international cuisines.

44:08.813 --> 44:11.916
No Spanish? No
problem. With Hawaii's

44:11.916 --> 44:17.989
latitude and Denver's altitude,
the temperate climate has
attracted retirees for decades.

44:17.989 --> 44:22.627
Mexicans have traditionally
taken elderly relatives into
their own homes. So, the

44:22.627 --> 44:28.533
demand for assisted living and
nursing care wasn't high, until
foreigners, many of them

44:28.533 --> 44:33.037
Americans, flocked here. Now
they are getting older and they
need more care.

44:33.037 --> 44:37.074
DAVID TRULY: People are not
just aging here, but for the
first time, they're staying here

44:37.074 --> 44:40.711
and they're not returning home.
So they're aging and dying in
place here.

44:40.711 --> 44:44.749
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: When
81-year-old John Simmons' doctor
told him he shouldn't live

44:44.749 --> 44:49.854
alone, he came here to
Abbeyfield, an independent
senior living facility. His one
bedroom

44:49.854 --> 44:54.358
casita sits in a lush garden
near a lap pool and a covered
patio.

44:54.358 --> 45:00.898
JOHN SIMMONS, Retiree: I love
the light. I love the
cross-ventilation. I like the

45:00.898 --> 45:07.371
kitchen tucked away. And so it
gives me room for an office and,
of course, the views

45:07.371 --> 45:14.011
out the windows with all the
wonderful plants. The
landscaping here, I think, is
fantastic.

45:14.011 --> 45:17.415
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The average
cost for independent living in
the U.S. is about $2,500

45:17.415 --> 45:18.616
a month.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.885
Here:

45:20.885 --> 45:29.627
JOHN SIMMONS: The rent,
including all utilities,
connections for Internet,
television, all

45:29.627 --> 45:36.567
of those things, plus three
meals a day, just a little over
$1,000 a month.

45:36.567 --> 45:41.138
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: One reason
for the cost difference, labor
is cheaper here. The minimum

45:41.138 --> 45:47.011
wage is just 70 pesos, or less
than $5 a day. For those who
need a bit more care, there's

45:47.011 --> 45:51.549
been a boom in assisted
living and nursing homes.

45:51.549 --> 45:56.087
Seventy-two-year-old Rosemary
Grayson came here from Wales.
She made headlines 50 years

45:56.087 --> 45:59.490
ago as the first "Playboy"
centerfold from the United
Kingdom and later went on to be

45:59.490 --> 46:01.425
a journalist.

46:01.425 --> 46:06.230
ROSEMARY GRAYSON, Retiree: I
was burnt out. I was in a state
of near nervous breakdown.

46:06.230 --> 46:09.367
Lakeside Care put
me together again.

46:09.367 --> 46:13.971
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Ron Langley
is a Floridian whose Mexican
wife has a degree in geriatric

46:13.971 --> 46:17.942
care run. Together, they run
Lakeside Care. He's proud of
the food he serves and the

46:17.942 --> 46:20.177
caregivers he employs.

46:20.177 --> 46:23.547
RON LANGLEY, Lakeside Care:
They have a great respect for
the elderly. And they

46:23.547 --> 46:27.652
will go out of their way
to help an elderly person.

46:27.652 --> 46:33.491
ROSEMARY GRAYSON: The people
here have compassion written
into their DNA. They do it
before

46:33.491 --> 46:38.996
they know it. The caring is
just like of being in an
extended family.

46:38.996 --> 46:42.933
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Assisted
care like this in the United
States averages about $3,800

46:42.933 --> 46:48.873
a month. And nursing homes can
cost upwards of $7,000. Langley
charges between $1,400

46:48.873 --> 46:53.611
and $2,000 a month for meals,
cleaning, laundry and more.

46:53.611 --> 46:57.114
RON LANGLEY: The only other
thing that a patient or a
resident here would pay for
would

46:57.114 --> 47:00.151
be their medicines
and their doctors.

47:00.151 --> 47:04.922
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: And that
raises a potential concern:
Does the area have top-notch
health

47:04.922 --> 47:09.427
care? A new hospital just
opened on the lake. Though
Medicare benefits don't apply

47:09.427 --> 47:15.232
in Mexico, doctor's visits and
prescriptions are often less
than co-pays back home. And

47:15.232 --> 47:18.502
Mexico's second largest
city is just an hour away.

47:18.502 --> 47:22.773
DAVID TRULY: We are very close
to Guadalajara, which can really
be considered kind of a medical

47:22.773 --> 47:26.444
hub of Latin America, some of
the finest medical colleges in
-- there's like three
universities

47:26.444 --> 47:28.446
there.

47:28.446 --> 47:33.918
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The Lake
Chapala area is beginning to
draw younger retirees, and

47:33.918 --> 47:38.923
some are bringing mom or dad
along; 64-year-old Mark Woolley
and his wife, Ann (ph), bought

47:38.923 --> 47:41.959
a house here a
year-and-a-half ago.

47:41.959 --> 47:46.197
When his 86-year-old mother,
Kempie McKenna (ph), came for
visit, she liked what she saw

47:46.197 --> 47:48.933
and chose a room at Abbeyfield.

47:48.933 --> 47:54.905
WOMAN: The second time I came,
I came with suitcases. It's so
relaxing here, with the

47:54.905 --> 47:58.943
sun coming in. The birds are up
there. The flowers are
blooming. It's just lovely.

47:58.943 --> 48:01.412
And we're just
sitting and chatting.

48:01.412 --> 48:07.952
MARK WOOLLEY, Retiree: She
always considered it more like
old-age storage, you know, a

48:07.952 --> 48:12.056
lot of the homes in the United
States, and they weren't very
nice. And these were literally

48:12.056 --> 48:17.928
homes here that people live in
and retire in, and with a bunch
of friends.

48:17.928 --> 48:21.799
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Senior care
is a cottage industry in the
Lake Chapala area now. There's

48:21.799 --> 48:26.370
little oversight, no government
regulation, no scheduled
inspections. Many homes appear

48:26.370 --> 48:31.575
well-run, but there's no
guarantee, so it's buyer beware.

48:31.575 --> 48:35.479
Most places have just a handful
of rooms, but that's about to
change.

48:35.479 --> 48:40.251
DR. TRINO ZEPEDA, Mexico: We
want to create a retirement
community with all the services

48:40.251 --> 48:43.954
related with the aging in place.

48:43.954 --> 48:47.525
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Dr. Trino
Zepeda (ph) is working on a new
large-scale development.

48:47.525 --> 48:50.361
DR. TRINO ZEPEDA: This is
assisted living apartments, and
it's going to be here.

48:50.361 --> 48:57.067
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: He expects
to break ground later this year
on a $35 million U.S.-style

48:57.067 --> 49:01.705
community, eventually housing
350 people, offering independent
living, assisted, nursing

49:01.705 --> 49:05.609
and memory care.

49:05.609 --> 49:10.581
Whether those plans succeed may
depend on whether Mexico can
overcome an image problem.

49:10.581 --> 49:16.620
The drumbeat of news about drug
cartel violence has included the
2012 kidnapping and killing

49:16.620 --> 49:21.525
of 18 Mexican nationals near
Ajijic. And the U.S. State
Department warns citizens to

49:21.525 --> 49:24.528
exercise caution in
the state of Jalisco.

49:24.528 --> 49:27.198
But none of that worries
Rosemary Grayson.

49:27.198 --> 49:33.370
ROSEMARY GRAYSON: You're a lot,
lot safer than I felt in the
U.K., and certainly in

49:33.370 --> 49:40.344
the U.S. I think they said 100
people -- 100 Americans were
killed in Mexico last year.

49:40.344 --> 49:45.983
And they have now said that
it's not a safe destination.
Well, you tell me how many

49:45.983 --> 49:50.855
safe destinations in the
cities of America there are.

49:50.855 --> 49:55.259
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: And one more
concern: Life moves at a slower
pace here.

49:55.259 --> 50:00.231
DAVID TRULY: Manana could mean
manana or the day after manana
or a week after manana.

50:00.231 --> 50:07.037
But, you know, there is
something to be said for the
kind of laid-back, almost, you
know,

50:07.037 --> 50:09.373
wake-me-up-when-we're
ready mentality.

50:09.373 --> 50:14.245
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Still, the
thriving foreign community has
lured baby boomers. The Lake

50:14.245 --> 50:20.251
Chapala Society, in business for
60 years, offers services for
expats and others, from

50:20.251 --> 50:25.856
free eye exams, to bridge, to
book clubs and volunteer
opportunities.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.559
Mark and Ann Woolley can imagine
themselves living at Abbeyfield.

50:28.559 --> 50:31.395
WOMAN: Oh, we're putting
our name on the list here.

50:31.395 --> 50:34.465
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: If the
Woolleys are any indication,
Mexico can expect an influx of

50:34.465 --> 50:38.335
Americans crossing the
border for retirement.

50:38.335 --> 50:43.107
I'm Kathleen McCleery for the
"PBS NewsHour" near Lake Chapala
,Mexico.

50:43.107 --> 50:47.411
GWEN IFILL: If you would like
to know a little bit more about
Rosemary Grayson, who

50:47.411 --> 50:51.882
Kathleen just introduced us to,
she tells the story of how she
met "Playboy" publisher

50:51.882 --> 51:00.691
Hugh Hefner and became Miss
October 1964. That's on our Web
site.

51:00.691 --> 51:10.301
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
"NewsHour" online right now: As
more expensive specialty
medicines

51:10.301 --> 51:15.739
come on the market to treat
serious chronic diseases, at
least seven states are tackling

51:15.739 --> 51:19.376
the problem of high
out-of-pocket payments. You can
learn about their efforts and
the

51:19.376 --> 51:22.446
spiraling costs of
pharmaceuticals.

51:22.446 --> 51:24.949
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:24.949 --> 51:29.286
GWEN IFILL: And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

51:29.286 --> 51:33.824
On Tuesday, the last-minute push
to meet a self-imposed deadline
to secure an Iran nuclear

51:33.824 --> 51:34.091
deal.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.392
I'm Gwen Ifill.

51:35.392 --> 51:37.695
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

51:37.695 --> 51:41.265
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

51:41.265 --> 51:41.565
you, and good night.
