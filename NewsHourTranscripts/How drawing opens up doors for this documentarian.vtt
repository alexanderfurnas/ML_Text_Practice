GWEN IFILL: Next, we turn to
Brief But Spectacular,
our occasional series where we
ask interesting

00:04.972 --> 00:07.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to discuss their
passions.

00:07.241 --> 00:12.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we hear from
illustrator and graphic
journalist Wendy Macnaughton,
who uses her

00:12.479 --> 00:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art to tell stories that might
otherwise be
overlooked.

00:15.148 --> 00:17.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY MACNAUGHTON, Illustrator
and Graphic
Journalist: So, you guys are
pointing this

00:17.851 --> 00:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camera in my face, but the great
thing is,
I don't have a camera, but I can
still capture

00:23.457 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. So, don't -- don't move.
OK. Hold on.
Oh, you guys are going to hate
me for this.

00:33.500 --> 00:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. So, don't -- don't move.
OK. Hold on.
Oh, you guys are going to hate
me for this.

00:43.610 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illustrated journalism is the
words that I
use to tell stories, real
stories using drawings

00:48.548 --> 00:52.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I do mostly from life, and
the words
of the people who I speak with.

00:52.252 --> 00:57.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, a lot of times,
with photography,
for example, if you will take a
camera and

00:57.190 --> 00:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will start documenting
people, right,
you will start like this --
like, you put

00:59.927 --> 01:03.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a camera in somebody's face,
then they might
feel a little objectified.

01:03.764 --> 01:09.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm not saying I do right
now. If you
have a sketchpad and you're
standing there

01:09.436 --> 01:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you're drawing, instead of
people wondering,
like, what you're doing to them,
they're curious

01:14.641 --> 01:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what you're doing. So,
people will come
up to me. It actually opens up
doors, whereas

01:19.313 --> 01:21.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other mediums might close them
down.

01:21.381 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have done stories on the
corners of Fifth
and Sixth Street in San
Francisco, two streets

01:28.588 --> 01:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incredibly different right next
to each other.
On Fifth Street, you have a ton
of people

01:33.060 --> 01:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are shopping, who are going
to work, who
are working at tech companies.

01:36.496 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you go over to Sixth
Street, and
you have people who have been
living there

01:40.233 --> 01:44.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for 20 years. It has got the
highest crime
rate in the city. It has one of
the highest

01:44.404 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug use rates in the city
there. It's just
a really, really tough place to
be. I think

01:48.575 --> 01:54.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was a good metaphor for what
is going on
in San Francisco right now.

01:54.114 --> 02:00.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, my aunt died, and it
was the first
time that I had ever been really
bedside while

02:00.854 --> 02:05.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody was dying. Drawing for
me is a way
of looking at things. It's like
an excuse

02:05.625 --> 02:09.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at something that I
might otherwise
be afraid of. So, I started
drawing my aunt

02:09.863 --> 02:11.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyday.

02:11.698 --> 02:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The drawings turned out, I
think, beautiful.
And they're hard to look at, but
they're good

02:16.470 --> 02:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at. The same day she
died, I got a
call from this hospice
organization asking

02:21.942 --> 02:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if I would be the artist in
residence.

02:23.744 --> 02:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went into the hospice project
thinking that
I was going to do a story about
the people

02:29.116 --> 02:34.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were dying and it would be
focused on
the people who are dying, but
now I have drawn

02:34.121 --> 02:40.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for several months, and I can
tell it's not.
It's probably going to be more
about the volunteers,

02:40.193 --> 02:45.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the amazing volunteers who are
caring for
the people and their families.

02:45.599 --> 02:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm interested in the stories of
people who
don't get their stories told.

02:50.504 --> 02:56.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
