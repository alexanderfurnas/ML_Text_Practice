JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.333 --> 00:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.333 --> 00:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
firestorm heats up around Donald
Trump Jr., as details emerge

00:13.333 --> 00:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his contacts with highly
placed Russians who offered
dirt on Hillary Clinton during

00:18.233 --> 00:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the presidential race.

00:20.366 --> 00:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: the second chapter of
our week-long series Inside
Putin's Russia explores the

00:26.633 --> 00:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country's propaganda
machine and the information
war against the West.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Instead
of offering communism
as an ideological
alternative, they are waging

00:35.033 --> 00:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a kind of hybrid war against
their enemies with a new
kind of soldier, hackers.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as senators
work to overhaul the Affordable
Care Act, we continue our look

00:46.900 --> 00:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at how health care affects
the people who need it most
with a trip to West Virginia,

00:51.800 --> 00:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where Medicaid expansion
proved crucial.

00:53.900 --> 00:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA HICKS, West Virginia:
I put my faith in those people
that they would make this

01:00.133 --> 01:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place better, not take
away the only things that
were helping this area.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:13.000 --> 01:15.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.800 --> 01:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For months,
a big question confronting
official Washington has been,

01:25.600 --> 01:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did the Trump campaign
collude with the Kremlin to
undermine Hillary Clinton?

01:29.866 --> 01:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, President Trump's
eldest son finds himself at the
heart of the matter after he

01:34.800 --> 01:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
released a potentially
explosive e-mail chain.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:40.766 --> 01:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The e-mails
show Donald Trump junior
eager to hear dirt on
Hillary Clinton, said

01:47.366 --> 01:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be offered as part of
Russian government support
for his father's campaign.

01:51.533 --> 01:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The chain begins with
message from Rob Goldstone.

01:54.833 --> 01:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a British-born
music publicist.

01:57.266 --> 02:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The younger Trump met him at
the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant
in Moscow, which President

02:03.000 --> 02:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump then owned.

02:05.033 --> 02:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Goldstone said a client's
father, a real estate developer
who teamed with President Trump

02:08.733 --> 02:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that pageant, had
been told of official
documents and information
that would incriminate

02:14.833 --> 02:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary and her
dealings with Russia.

02:16.900 --> 02:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Goldstone said it was part of
Russia and its government's
support for Mr. Trump.

02:23.366 --> 02:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. responds: "If
it's what you say, I love it."

02:26.866 --> 02:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a four-day flurry of e-mails,
Donald Trump Jr. and Goldstone
set up a meeting at Trump

02:33.333 --> 02:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tower in New York with Russian
lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.

02:36.766 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also attending, Trump son-in-law
Jared Kushner and campaign
chairman Paul Manafort.

02:43.766 --> 02:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Veselnitskaya told NBC News
today she has no connection
to Russian government and knew

02:48.600 --> 02:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing damaging about Clinton.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA,
Attorney (through translator):
It is quite possible
that maybe they were

02:52.733 --> 02:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
looking for such an information.

02:54.566 --> 02:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They wanted it so badly.

02:56.633 --> 03:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Donald Trump
Jr. said he thought he was being
offered political opposition

03:01.633 --> 03:03.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
research.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son says
he put out the e-mails to
be totally transparent.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On Capitol Hill, the
release generated more
questions than answers.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: I know Donald
Trump Jr. is new to politics.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that Jared Kushner is new
to politics, but this is going
to require a lot of questions

03:19.166 --> 03:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be asked and answered.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:22.266 --> 03:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: If you
look at Donald Trump Jr.'s own
admissions -- these are his

03:27.633 --> 03:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
words, not mine, his -- this
was an attempt at collusion.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so now the question is
really, was it successful?

03:37.066 --> 03:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At an off-camera
White House briefing,
principal Deputy Press
Secretary Sarah Huckabee

03:41.833 --> 03:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders read a one-line
statement from the president.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
"My son is a high-quality

03:46.866 --> 03:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
person and I applaud
his transparency."

03:49.400 --> 03:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sanders said
the president only learned
of his son's meeting
in the last several

03:54.033 --> 03:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days, but wouldn't say whether
he knew of the apparent Russian
offer to help his campaign.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

04:02.766 --> 04:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to
Mark Mazzetti, Washington
investigations editor
for The New York Times.

04:09.133 --> 04:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's been leading the
team of reporters that
broke today's story.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Mazzetti, welcome
back to the program.

04:15.300 --> 04:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, tell us what the latest
information is that The Times
is reporting on connections,

04:21.866 --> 04:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
contacts between the
Trump, the Trump family
and Russian officials.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI, The New York
Times: Well, last night, The
Times reported the existence of

04:28.433 --> 04:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an e-mail that showed that
the meeting that was brokered
in June of 2016 showed -- an

04:36.066 --> 04:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mail to Donald Trump
Jr. -- showed that
the offer of damaging
information about Hillary

04:43.066 --> 04:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton came from the Russian
government or was purported to
come from the Russian government

04:46.400 --> 04:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that Donald Trump Jr.
very eager responded that
he was very interested.

04:53.266 --> 04:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it seemed to raise the
stakes, because it was no
longer just private information

04:56.633 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a lawyer, but something
that seemed to come from
Moscow and the Kremlin.

05:00.733 --> 05:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, we reported on
the actual e-mails themselves,
what the e-mails contained that

05:08.066 --> 05:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show the long thread that led
up to the June 9, 2016, meeting
between these various players,

05:15.733 --> 05:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and at the same time, right as
we were about to publish, Donald
Trump Jr. put out the e-mails

05:20.566 --> 05:22.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

05:22.566 --> 05:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
again, striking language
in the e-mails, at
one point referring to

05:28.200 --> 05:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this is part of Russia
and its government's
support for Mr. Trump.

05:32.133 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I want to ask you
about what happened today.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When your reporters
reached out to Donald
Trump Jr., what happened?

05:38.333 --> 05:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: We reached out
to his attorney in the morning,
notifying him that we were

05:45.333 --> 05:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
planning to publish the
contents of the e-mails
and gave them a deadline.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And right around the
time of the deadline,
when we were waiting for
their comment, Donald

05:56.800 --> 05:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump Jr. put the e-mails
themselves out on Twitter, and
that's when we published our

05:59.666 --> 06:01.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Was what Donald
Trump Jr. put out on Twitter
exactly what The Times had?

06:07.633 --> 06:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: The e-mails
that he put out are consistent
certainly with what we saw.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And The Times
was prepared to publish them
whether he had done that or

06:17.933 --> 06:19.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK MAZZETTI: Well,
we were not planning to
publish actual e-mails.

06:23.400 --> 06:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had a story ready describing
the e-mails with some actual
word-for-word language in

06:28.300 --> 06:30.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the e-mails.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the word-for-word language
that we were going to quote
from in our story lined up

06:33.433 --> 06:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with what he put out on Twitter.

06:35.466 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it fair to
say, Mark Mazzetti, that Donald
Trump Jr. and others involved

06:41.133 --> 06:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the story have
been cooperating?

06:43.133 --> 06:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because the sense one gets
from reading these stories over
the past few days is that the

06:48.633 --> 06:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explanations you have been
given by Donald Trump Jr. and
by others has changed from day

06:52.566 --> 06:54.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to day.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Yes, it's been
evolving over about four days.

06:56.700 --> 07:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saturday, when we were
publishing our first
story about this meeting,
we got a response

07:01.100 --> 07:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Donald Trump Jr. that the
meeting was about primarily
adoptions, which is a big

07:08.033 --> 07:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue for the Russian government
relating to the sanctions
the United States has imposed

07:11.966 --> 07:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the Russian government.

07:14.533 --> 07:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next day when we were
publishing our second
story, we knew that the
meeting was not about

07:19.266 --> 07:20.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

07:20.966 --> 07:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It was about proposed
damaging information
about Hillary Clinton.

07:22.433 --> 07:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We got another statement
that said, yes, that's true.

07:26.966 --> 07:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, it was something
anyone would do.

07:29.266 --> 07:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Any one part of the
campaign would look for
damaging information
about their opponent.

07:32.700 --> 07:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then, yesterday, we
told them that we were
planning to publish the
e-mail that -- published

07:39.633 --> 07:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the existence of an e-mail
that indicated it was
Russian government support.

07:41.766 --> 07:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's been yet another answer.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, yes, it certainly has
evolved over several days.

07:45.466 --> 07:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
Mark Mazzetti, what is
the White House saying
about the president's

07:51.066 --> 07:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
involvement this?

07:52.666 --> 07:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What has Donald Trump
Jr. said about that?

07:55.066 --> 08:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Well, what
the president knew about
this is still unclear.

08:01.666 --> 08:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The White House has said
the president didn't
know of the meeting.

08:04.500 --> 08:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there has been some, I would
say, conflicting accounts coming
out of the White House about

08:11.566 --> 08:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just how to handle this story
and how it should be spun and
how to handle the damage that

08:21.100 --> 08:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was coming out of this story.

08:23.100 --> 08:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the question of -- and
there has been, frankly, some
blame going on internally about

08:27.766 --> 08:30.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the question, the
main question, of course,
we are still endeavoring
to find out is what

08:35.133 --> 08:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now President Trump knew
about the meeting at the time.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But as you say
,right now, the White House is
saying he had no involvement?

08:40.833 --> 08:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: That's right.

08:43.266 --> 08:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Mazzetti,
Washington investigations
editor for The New York
Times, thank you very

08:47.500 --> 08:48.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Thank you.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more
on the latest documents in
the Russia investigation, we

08:52.600 --> 08:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn to the vice chairman on
the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, Mark Warner of

08:56.733 --> 08:57.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us from Capitol Hill.

08:59.566 --> 09:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Warner, thank
you for being here.

09:01.233 --> 09:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of
this latest story?

09:03.066 --> 09:05.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
®MD-BSEN.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Well,
Judy, again, I have said this
a couple of times, that you

09:07.633 --> 09:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't make some
of this stuff up.

09:09.733 --> 09:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would -- it
strains credibility.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This bothers me on
a variety of levels.

09:15.766 --> 09:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, it bothers me that this
is a continuing series of
individuals affiliated with the

09:22.500 --> 09:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign or the Trump
administration who say they
have had no meetings or contacts

09:28.533 --> 09:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russians, until there is
proof of those meetings, and
then they have to recant or,

09:34.833 --> 09:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the case of General Flynn,
the national security adviser,
he got fired, or the attorney

09:36.933 --> 09:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
general had to recuse himself.

09:39.633 --> 09:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's particularly, I
think, significant about these
last 48 hours is, this is the

09:43.900 --> 09:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time the public is seeing
now in black and white what we
have heard from the intelligence

09:50.800 --> 09:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community, that there was an
organized effort by the Russian
government to interfere to

09:54.633 --> 09:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help one candidate, Donald
Trump, to hurt another
candidate, Hillary Clinton.

09:59.533 --> 10:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what is so particularly
disturbing is that we have
now got the president's son,

10:03.966 --> 10:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's son-in-law and
the president's campaign manager
at the time all being willing

10:11.033 --> 10:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take the meeting that this
so-called Russian agent, or at
least has been represented as

10:16.133 --> 10:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of this Russian government
effort to discredit Clinton,
and that they were anxious

10:18.866 --> 10:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to receive this
kind of information.

10:21.433 --> 10:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find that -- and there
would be folks like
special counsel Mueller
who will have to determine

10:28.133 --> 10:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether that meets a legal
standard of criminality,
but it sure does make
it very important that

10:33.233 --> 10:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we in the Senate investigating
committee get a chance
to talk to all three
of these individuals,

10:36.633 --> 10:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which we plan to do.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
you mentioned -- you
used the word collusion.

10:40.366 --> 10:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You said that's what this
investigation has been about.

10:44.933 --> 10:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of your Democratic
colleagues on the Intelligence
Committee, Senator Wyden
of Oregon, said today

10:51.333 --> 10:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this proves there was at
least an attempt at collusion.

10:53.633 --> 10:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that how you see it?

10:54.633 --> 10:56.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK WARNER: Well, Judy,
I feel like my job in
this investigation is to
keep this investigation

10:59.033 --> 11:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bipartisan, working
along with Chairman Burr.

11:01.700 --> 11:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to reserve my final
judgments until we get a chance
to talk to all of the witnesses,

11:08.100 --> 11:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get all of the information that
we're continuing to collect.

11:10.533 --> 11:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it sure as heck bothers me
that there is this continuing
pattern of individuals

11:17.866 --> 11:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Trump campaign and
the Trump administration
denying these contacts
with Russians, and

11:21.200 --> 11:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then, when the proof comes
out, they dodge or dance
or amend their filings.

11:28.233 --> 11:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, now, in a particular case,
we're asked to believe that the
president's son and son-in-law

11:34.366 --> 11:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had information that was part
of a Russian government effort
to discredit their opponent,

11:41.400 --> 11:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that somehow that was
never shared with their
father or father-in-law.

11:43.366 --> 11:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, I will accept that their
word until we get a chance
to talk to them in person.

11:48.133 --> 11:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
how do you, though, interpret
their evolving explanations?

11:52.833 --> 11:54.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:54.966 --> 11:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: It is -- frankly,
it strains credibility that
this administration continues

12:00.900 --> 12:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say there's no there there,
yet we have seen this pattern,
not with one, two, three,

12:06.033 --> 12:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but literally I think it was
close to a dozen individuals
that have either been affiliated

12:08.733 --> 12:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the information or in a
case of certain spokespeople
who said, for example, that Jim

12:15.766 --> 12:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey was fired because of his
bad performance with handling
the Hillary Clinton e-mails,

12:21.333 --> 12:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only to be corrected by the
president himself when he called
James Comey a nutjob in front

12:27.733 --> 12:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Russians and said it
was all about the Russian
investigation itself.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have this constant
pattern where this
administration doesn't
come clean on these

12:36.866 --> 12:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
items involving Russia until
the proof comes out, and then
we hear fairly feeble excuses.

12:42.066 --> 12:44.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I hear
you saying, Senator,
you're not prepared to
pronounce whether there

12:44.866 --> 12:46.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was collusion.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're not prepared to
say whether there was
illegality, but you have
been around politics

12:49.700 --> 12:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now for a number of years.

12:52.366 --> 12:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you judge, how do you
weigh the -- at least the facts
on the table at this point?

12:59.300 --> 13:01.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Well, Judy, I
have heard some of the people
coming to the defense of the

13:05.133 --> 13:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president's son that this
was a rookie mistake.

13:07.766 --> 13:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't accept that.

13:10.233 --> 13:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think anyone of any kind
of basic knowledge would know
that you don't take information

13:19.300 --> 13:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a foreign power, and
particularly a foreign power
that's an adversary like Russia.

13:24.200 --> 13:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, clearly, what was laid
out in the e-mail in black and
white was that this was part

13:30.666 --> 13:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a Russian government effort
to help then candidate Trump.

13:33.200 --> 13:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see, not only was there
no pushback on that, but in
terms of reading the e-mail,

13:40.233 --> 13:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. said, that's
great, and wouldn't it be great
if we got that information late

13:42.933 --> 13:45.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the summer?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you follow the timeline
-- I'm sure all your audience
hasn't followed this quite

13:48.300 --> 13:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as closely as I have -- but
it was late in the summer that
more and more of these DNC

13:55.333 --> 13:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails were released, where
then Trump confidant Roger Stone
first started tweeting about the

14:01.100 --> 14:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that he had contact with
a Russian cutout, Guccifer 2.0,
and that it would soon be John

14:05.900 --> 14:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Podesta's turn in
the so-called barrel.

14:08.033 --> 14:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sure enough, it was John
Podesta's e-mails that were
subsequently leaked as well.

14:12.266 --> 14:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the timing, in terms of
what Donald Trump Jr. was hoping
and then what came to pass

14:18.133 --> 14:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is also a little bit curious.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, finally,
how do you view the likelihood
that the president himself

14:22.500 --> 14:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't know about this?

14:23.833 --> 14:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The White House is
saying he did not know.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you take them at their word?

14:27.066 --> 14:28.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:28.566 --> 14:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I will take them
at their word at this point.

14:30.566 --> 14:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the idea that the
president's son and son-in-law
had this kind of outreach from

14:36.400 --> 14:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what appears to be an agent of
the Russian government, and that
there was a Russian government

14:38.466 --> 14:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
- - knowledge of an
effort to help candidate
Trump, I'm surprised
at least -- and, again,

14:45.300 --> 14:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will take them at their
word -- but surprised at
least that this wouldn't
come up over dinner

14:49.100 --> 14:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation at some point
over the ensuing months.

14:51.466 --> 14:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can we
assume that's a question
you will be asking?

14:53.533 --> 14:55.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:55.566 --> 14:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: You can
assume darn right that's a
question I will be asking.

14:58.133 --> 15:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
Mark Warner, vice chairman
of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence,

15:01.400 --> 15:02.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Thank you, Judy.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news: The U.S. military
confirmed that 15 Marines

15:11.366 --> 15:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a Navy Corpsman died on
Monday when a tanker plane
crashed in Mississippi.

15:17.033 --> 15:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The plane's last stop was
the Cherry Point Marine Air
Station in North Carolina.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It went down in a soybean
field 85 miles north of
Jackson, Mississippi.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thick smoke billowed
from the wreckage for
hours after the crash.

15:28.933 --> 15:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The FBI joined the
investigation, but
officials said they do
not suspect foul play.

15:35.900 --> 15:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iraq, scattered new fighting
erupted in Western Mosul, even
after the government claimed

15:41.000 --> 15:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
total victory over
Islamic State fighters.

15:43.566 --> 15:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Amnesty
International accused
ISIS militants of summary
executions and using

15:49.466 --> 15:51.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human shields.

15:51.466 --> 15:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also blamed Iraqi forces
and U.S. coalition airstrikes
for civilian casualties.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the coalition
disputed that claim.

15:58.733 --> 15:59.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

15:59.733 --> 16:01.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN TOWNSEND, U.S. Army: I
would challenge the people from
Amnesty International or anyone

16:03.933 --> 16:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else out there who makes these
charges to first research their
facts and make sure they're

16:09.233 --> 16:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
speaking from a
position of authority.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would argue that this
is, I believe, the most
precise campaign in
the history of warfare.

16:21.800 --> 16:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of Western
Mosul has been laid waste by
fighting that began in February.

16:28.700 --> 16:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
traveled to Qatar today,
trying to resolve a rift with

16:32.866 --> 16:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its Persian Gulf neighbors.

16:34.900 --> 16:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Four Arab nations have slapped
sanctions on the oil state
over charges that it fosters

16:39.700 --> 16:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamist extremism.

16:41.533 --> 16:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson signed a
counterterrorism agreement with
the Qatari foreign minister.

16:46.233 --> 16:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His next stop is Saudi Arabia,

Back in this country, fire crews
in the Western U.S. made more
progress today, but, in some

17:01.066 --> 17:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cases, they were too late.

In Northern California, at
least 36 homes burned down
near Oroville over the weekend.

17:09.066 --> 17:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That fire is still burning
in places, keeping some

Fires are also still burning

the mourners, condemning
violence against police.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor
of New York: We have watched
with horror these attacks on

17:47.633 --> 17:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our police here in this
city and all around our
country, and it sickens us.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we know they
cannot be tolerated.

President Trump's election
fraud commission now says that
states don't have to provide

18:12.433 --> 18:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
detailed voter
information just yet.

18:15.300 --> 18:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The panel put that word out
in an e-mail, as a federal

18:23.166 --> 18:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of states have refused

and much more.

19:14.900 --> 19:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We return to our week-long
series, Inside Putin's Russia.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For years, the Kremlin and the
media it controls have waged
a multifaceted information and

19:25.966 --> 19:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disinformation campaign both
inside Russia, and pointed
at its perceived adversaries.

19:31.933 --> 19:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last year, that effort
crescendoed here during the
U.S. presidential campaign.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tonight, we look at
the information war.

19:40.200 --> 19:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the help of the
Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting, special
correspondent Nick Schifrin

19:46.566 --> 19:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and producer Zach Fannin
begin their report in Moscow.

19:49.066 --> 19:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Russia,
whoever controls the media
controls the country.

19:55.266 --> 19:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Saturday nights
are Sergey Brilev's.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The 44-year-old is an
anchor for Russia One.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the country's most popular
channel, and it's state-owned.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that that
means you have a Russian
perspective when you report?

20:06.533 --> 20:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEY BRILEV, News Anchor:
Well, of course there's
a Russian perspective.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a perspective of
your country in any reporting.

20:11.566 --> 20:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Brilev says
he doesn't feel pressure to
push the government's line.

20:14.800 --> 20:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the show we saw,
he challenged a government
minister about police
jailing a former theater

20:19.033 --> 20:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
director who's a
government critic.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEY BRILEV: I imagine
that tomorrow -- tonight,
after the broadcast, I
may have some security

20:29.600 --> 20:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agencies, and saying, what
does he think he's saying?

20:33.866 --> 20:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russian
state media have long
delivered the government
perspective and rallied

20:37.900 --> 20:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the public behind it.

20:39.366 --> 20:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brilev denies that's his job.

20:40.933 --> 20:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he hints at whose job it is.

20:43.633 --> 20:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEY BRILEV: The Sunday
program, which is quite
conservative in Western
terms, ultra-conservative,

20:49.033 --> 20:50.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say.

20:50.233 --> 20:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Aggressive, perhaps?

20:51.466 --> 20:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SERGEY BRILEV: Well,
FOX News-style.

20:53.533 --> 20:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Sunday night
anchor Dmitry Kiselyov is part
Sean Hannity, part Stephen

20:58.300 --> 21:00.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Colbert.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's crass and entertaining,
and widely believed to reflect
the Kremlin's thinking.

21:03.133 --> 21:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRY KISELYOV, News Anchor:
The American press is driving
Trump into a bullfight with

21:08.733 --> 21:09.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no rules.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The aim is impeachment.

21:11.066 --> 21:12.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No pretext?

21:12.500 --> 21:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will be created, invented,
engineered, exaggerated.

21:17.300 --> 21:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIA staff hackers are
hiding behind another
name, for example, behind
the so-called Russian

21:23.133 --> 21:25.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hackers.

21:25.166 --> 21:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kiselyov started
targeting Russia's opponents
in 2012 after massive protests

21:28.833 --> 21:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatened President Vladimir
Putin, says journalist
and author Mikhail Zygar.

21:32.400 --> 21:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKHAIL ZYGAR,
Journalist/Author: That
was very important to
start hating the enemies.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the point when the
audience starts believing you.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRY KISELYOV (through
translator): Russia is
the only country in the
world that is realistically

21:45.833 --> 21:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capable of turning the United
States into radioactive ash.

21:50.200 --> 21:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Until 2015,
Zygar was the anchor and
editor in chief of TV Rain.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a sea of state media, TV Rain
was an independent TV island.

21:58.766 --> 22:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL ZYGAR: We have had
the reputation of the only TV
channel that is trying to make

22:02.566 --> 22:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
real investigations.

22:05.166 --> 22:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In 2014,
TV Rain accused the
Kremlin's chief political
strategist of corruption.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL ZYGAR: There was
a very short, but very
effective campaign against us.

22:12.766 --> 22:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was getting like hundreds
of personal messages with
people wishing me death.

22:19.766 --> 22:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then all the major networks
had direct phone calls from
Kremlin and they had to switch

22:27.233 --> 22:29.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us off.

22:29.233 --> 22:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Within one
month, their audience dropped
from 20 million to 60,000.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Protesters fought to
keep them on the air.

22:34.266 --> 22:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But targeting critical
media is nothing new.

22:36.900 --> 22:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the last six years,
the Kremlin targeted
12 critical newsrooms.

22:41.333 --> 22:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zygar says state TV tries
to convince Russians to
support their government
by replacing reality

22:47.500 --> 22:49.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
with a carefully
crafted message.

22:49.266 --> 22:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKHAIL ZYGAR: Democracy
does not exist.

22:52.366 --> 22:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our system is much more stable,
because we have much more
-- much stronger leadership.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DMITRY KISELYOV (through
translator): Putin is
universally accepted
as one of the most

23:02.066 --> 23:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
qualified heads of state
on the planet, if not
the most qualified.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But
this isn't only about
shaping Russian opinion.

23:08.900 --> 23:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kiselyov considers the
news a weapon aimed at
Russia's enemies, as he
put it in an interview

23:13.466 --> 23:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on his own channel.

23:15.466 --> 23:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DMITRY KISELYOV (through
translator): If you can persuade
a person, you don't need to kill

23:19.566 --> 23:20.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

23:20.966 --> 23:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's think about what's
better: to kill or to persuade?

23:24.100 --> 23:26.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Because if you aren't
able to persuade, then
you will have to kill.

23:26.933 --> 23:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BMARGARITA SIMONYAN,
Editor in Chief, R.T.:
If the politics of
defending your country's

23:30.400 --> 23:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest is pro-Russian, then
probably we are pro-Russian.

23:34.066 --> 23:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Margarita
Simonyan is the editor
in chief of R.T.,
formerly known as Russia

23:38.833 --> 23:40.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Today.

23:40.866 --> 23:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says the network reaches
35 million viewers a day in six
languages, including American

23:43.966 --> 23:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and international channels.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's state-owned and
aimed at foreign audiences
as an alternative to
channels Simonyan calls

23:49.700 --> 23:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pro-Western, CNN and BBC.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BMARGARITA SIMONYAN:
If you look at any station,
you will see that what people

23:55.600 --> 24:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are reporting comes from what
they believe in, where they
stand, their background, what

24:01.533 --> 24:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their countries believe in.

24:03.566 --> 24:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let us be one of the voices
in that choir, because when
the choir sings just one song,

24:14.933 --> 24:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
awful things happen,
like the war in Iraq.

24:17.600 --> 24:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Critics say
R.T. isn't just another media
voice; it highlights conspiracy

24:23.300 --> 24:25.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
theories.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: The article
basically accuses the
U.S. of manufacturing
this Ebola outbreak.

24:27.766 --> 24:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It describes
a Holocaust denier as a
human rights activist.

24:31.300 --> 24:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Russia is a threat
to the U.S.' hegemony.

24:34.233 --> 24:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And a
neo-Nazi as a German expert.

24:38.166 --> 24:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Germany is a country which
supports violent Islamism.

24:42.466 --> 24:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The criticism
is, again, that you're trying
to confuse, rather than inform.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD-BMARGARITA SIMONYAN:
Now, that's absolutely a lie.

24:48.433 --> 24:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're never trying to confuse.

24:49.933 --> 24:52.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're informing.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we do have people appearing
on the air live that are later
found out to be Holocaust

24:59.266 --> 25:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deniers or anything like that,
we immediately put them onto a
list of people who are forbidden

25:05.600 --> 25:07.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the air.

25:07.266 --> 25:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You are telling me that
people in the West are
seeing us as a threat.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Believe me, most of the
people in Russia are seeing
the West as a threat.

25:12.866 --> 25:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the
West, the biggest threat
in terms of information
comes from that building.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the headquarters of the
FSB, the successor to the KGB.

25:20.333 --> 25:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During Soviet times, the
KGB launched deliberate
disinformation campaigns,
like planting the

25:25.100 --> 25:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
idea that President Kennedy
was killed by the CIA.

25:28.233 --> 25:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Western governments
accuse the FSB of launching
the same kinds of campaigns,

25:32.766 --> 25:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
except, instead of offering
communism as an ideological
alternative, they are waging a

25:36.833 --> 25:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of hybrid war against
their enemies, with a new
kind of soldier, hackers.

25:43.833 --> 25:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the last two years,
the Russian military
ran online recruiting
ads where soldiers put

25:47.533 --> 25:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down their guns to
fight a cyber-war.

25:50.500 --> 25:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a January report, U.S.
intelligence agencies
accused Russia of hacking
Democratic National

25:55.133 --> 25:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee and Hillary
Clinton campaign e-mails
and leaking them to
WikiLeaks to fuel Russia's

25:59.566 --> 26:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
propaganda campaign.

26:01.700 --> 26:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was designed to -- quote
-- "undermine public faith in
the U.S. democratic process,

26:05.133 --> 26:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
denigrate Secretary Clinton,
and harm her electability
and potential presidency."

26:09.400 --> 26:11.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It worked.

26:11.433 --> 26:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY, FOX News: The
Clinton campaign has now had
to deal with more than a week

26:13.566 --> 26:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of embarrassing
daily revelations,
thanks to WikiLeaks.

26:16.033 --> 26:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: Now, these
WikiLeaks' releases have
rocked the campaign.

26:19.166 --> 26:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC:
WikiLeaks has released
what appears to be
transcripts of paid speeches

26:24.066 --> 26:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by Hillary Clinton
to Goldman Sachs.

26:26.233 --> 26:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Hacked
e-mails became anti-Clinton
talking points.

26:29.366 --> 26:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of those talking
points were spread
online by fake accounts
known as trolls believed

26:34.066 --> 26:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to work in this St.
Petersburg building.

26:36.933 --> 26:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Forty-two-year-old Marat
Mindiyarov used to be
one of those trolls.

26:39.633 --> 26:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARAT MINDIYAROV, Former Troll:
Every day, you see a lot of
comment at night, and they're

26:44.166 --> 26:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all the same, yes.

26:47.100 --> 26:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's exactly the
people doing their job.

26:51.066 --> 26:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have their topic.

26:52.066 --> 26:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a time to do it.

26:53.066 --> 26:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They write it, and you see it.

26:55.033 --> 26:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Every day,
Mindiyarov would get a document
that instructed him what to

26:57.466 --> 26:59.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
write.

26:59.533 --> 27:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Christmas Eve, 2014, he was
told to -- quote - - "create a
negative attitude about Obama's

27:02.600 --> 27:04.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
foreign policy."

27:04.633 --> 27:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he posted photos comparing
Obama to Hitler, portraying
the U.S. as a fish about to eat

27:08.233 --> 27:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the planet and an eagle
sharpening his talons.

27:11.333 --> 27:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He posted under the headline,
"Can the U.S. take Russia out?"
on 50 Web sites in 23 cities.

27:18.233 --> 27:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And fellow trolls Kiril
Ivashkin, Gennady Orlov, Mike
Brandon expressed the exact same

27:23.866 --> 27:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought, 600 posts from 70
fake accounts in 12 hours, just
one battalion in a sock puppet

27:28.866 --> 27:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
army manufactured by
a handful of trolls.

27:31.666 --> 27:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How many identities will
the workers be expected
to pretend to be?

27:37.533 --> 27:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARAT MINDIYAROV: Hundreds.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hundreds.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Really, hundreds.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I myself maybe had 20, 30.

27:41.666 --> 27:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't count them.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: U.S. intelligence
says the likely troll
financier is Evgeny Prigozhin,

27:47.033 --> 27:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a businessman with
catering companies.

27:49.433 --> 27:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's been dubbed
Putin's personal chef.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mindiyarov left the
factory because he didn't
believe in its product.

27:54.633 --> 27:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he says it's effective
because the stories are
succinct and echoed widely.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARAT MINDIYAROV: Everything
is very simple there, yes,
black and white, no color, just

28:05.100 --> 28:07.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
black and white.

28:07.133 --> 28:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN NIMMO, Atlantic Council:
Russian propaganda is actually
very predictable and relatively

28:10.733 --> 28:12.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
simple.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think of it as the
four D's, which are dismiss,
distort, distract, and dismay.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Ben Nimmo is An
Atlantic Council senior fellow
studying how Russian media,

28:19.366 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian hacking and
Russian trolling combine.

28:21.900 --> 28:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN NIMMO: You get your
own people to write this,
but then you pretend
it's not your people,

28:25.533 --> 28:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's just some do-gooders
in Russian society.

28:28.133 --> 28:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the different parts of your
machine then amplify it, and
what you're doing is you're

28:31.633 --> 28:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushing out in a dozen
different languages on all the
different platforms there are,

28:35.766 --> 28:37.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one story.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what that story is what
the Kremlin wants it to be.

28:40.266 --> 28:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In January 2016,
it was a fake story that a
Russian-German teenager had been

28:45.233 --> 28:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
abducted and raped
by Muslim migrants.

28:47.433 --> 28:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN NIMMO: The Russian state
TV apparatus repeatedly
reporting false claims after the

28:54.733 --> 28:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
German police had come out
and said that there was no
abduction and there was no rape.

28:58.500 --> 29:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The fake story
helped spark real protests
against German President Angela

29:03.300 --> 29:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Merkel, a frequent Putin critic.

29:05.833 --> 29:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But even though it was fake,
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
used it to criticize one of

29:09.900 --> 29:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russia's top adversaries.

29:11.966 --> 29:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN NIMMO: The motivation
behind the campaign as a whole
was precisely to weaken Merkel

29:15.533 --> 29:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by amplifying this
very personalized story
about crimes committed
by, in inverted commas,

29:21.266 --> 29:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Merkel's migrants.

29:22.966 --> 29:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: We investigate the
stories misrepresented
by the mainstream media.

29:25.466 --> 29:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Last year,
the Russian propaganda
machine exploited a
research psychologist

29:29.566 --> 29:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who argued Google was
manipulating its results
to favor Clinton.

29:32.700 --> 29:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BEN NIMMO: So, this
is a gentlemen called
Dr. Robert Epstein.

29:35.266 --> 29:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He came out with a paper which
said that by altering the
results of a search engine, you

29:44.433 --> 29:46.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could potentially alter
people's voting choices.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT EPSTEIN, Research
Psychologist: And
Google's support for
Clinton is really very

29:51.100 --> 29:52.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strong.

29:52.300 --> 29:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It
was quickly debunked.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the different parts
of the Russian propaganda
machine echoed the story,
from R.T., to state-owned

29:59.966 --> 30:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Web site Sputnik,
to Russian trolls.

30:02.533 --> 30:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN NIMMO: This is a
classic example in which
the different parts of the
machine were amplifying

30:05.500 --> 30:07.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

30:07.533 --> 30:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What you then had was the claim
being picked up by a number
of largely conservative media

30:11.500 --> 30:13.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: It looks like Google
is in the tank for Hillary.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:16.233 --> 30:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBERT EPSTEIN: There's
no question about it.

30:17.933 --> 30:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BEN NIMMO: And now
you have divorced the
story from the source.

30:20.066 --> 30:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Well, you
have laundered -- you have
literally laundered the source.

30:21.900 --> 30:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN NIMMO: And in that sense,
the source has been laundered.

30:28.866 --> 30:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then candidate Trump said
words the effect of Google was
rigging its results in favor

30:33.400 --> 30:35.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Clinton.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Google's search
engine was suppressing the

30:37.133 --> 30:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bad news about Hillary Clinton.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN NIMMO: Now, we don't know
where he got that from, but
we know that the insertion

30:42.966 --> 30:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point for that story was a
Kremlin disinformation outlet.

30:47.300 --> 30:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For any purveyor of propaganda,
your dream is to have some
high-value amplifier amplifying

30:54.533 --> 30:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, especially if you can
contrive that in such a way
that you are divorced from it.

31:00.466 --> 31:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: How about that?

31:01.133 --> 31:02.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How about that?

31:02.766 --> 31:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

Russians have joined ISIS.

31:24.566 --> 31:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With Congress back from their

31:29.333 --> 31:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

31:35.733 --> 31:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of this as the August

In a minute, John Yang will be

31:53.100 --> 31:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax reform, Utah Senator Mike
Lee and nine fellow Republicans
asked today to cancel the

SEN.

32:00.333 --> 32:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE LEE (R), Utah: At this

us to just take the month of

32:02.433 --> 32:04.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
August off.

32:04.366 --> 32:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Majority

MITCH MCCONNELL: We will be
on health care next week.

32:19.833 --> 32:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be laying out a revised
version of the repeal and
replace effort, the text of

32:28.300 --> 32:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that, on Thursday morning.

32:30.800 --> 32:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Multiple
Republican senators
told "NewsHour" this
is what's in the latest

32:35.066 --> 32:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan: It restores an
investment tax and a
Medicare tax on the wealthy.

32:39.466 --> 32:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plans to cut those taxes drew
criticism as helping the rich.

32:42.866 --> 32:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More subsidies or tax
credits for lower-income
families and billions
more for opioid treatment.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But indications are there
will be essentially no changes
to the Medicaid section.

32:55.133 --> 32:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That would cut the number of
people on Medicaid by millions.

32:57.633 --> 33:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one unusual twist:
Republicans are still mulling an
amendment from Texas Senator Ted

33:04.566 --> 33:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cruz that will allow
insurers to offer just
one Obamacare-compliant
plan and avoid its

33:08.833 --> 33:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regulations in the rest.

33:10.833 --> 33:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That general idea could
bring on Cruz and other
key votes like Lee.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE LEE: That's one way to
get me to yes on the bill.

33:18.166 --> 33:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Democrats,
like Senator Jeanne Shaheen,
voiced a concern some Republican

33:22.033 --> 33:23.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moderates share.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:25.533 --> 33:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEANNE SHAHEEN (D), New
Hampshire: Our Republican
colleagues haven't
had just six months to

33:26.666 --> 33:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
put together a health care bill.

33:28.066 --> 33:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have had seven
years and six months.

33:31.066 --> 33:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the Cruz amendment
is not the answer.

33:33.733 --> 33:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would roll back
protections for people with
preexisting conditions.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would cost more
for consumers.

33:39.733 --> 33:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All said, it
is not yet clear if a revised
plan will get the 50 votes it

33:45.200 --> 33:47.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needs.

33:47.233 --> 33:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
McConnell wants to hold
that vote next week,
and many Republicans
say it's time, win or

33:50.933 --> 33:51.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lose.

33:51.933 --> 33:53.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KENNEDY (R), Louisiana: In
my judgment, it's time to vote.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: These
are unusual times.

33:57.100 --> 34:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Senate Historian's Office
tells me that only once in
modern history has the Senate

34:01.500 --> 34:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cut short its August recess.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John, guess what the topic was?

34:05.233 --> 34:06.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was 1994.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was health care.

34:08.633 --> 34:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats failed to pass
their bill back then.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG:
Hillarycare back then.

34:11.366 --> 34:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

34:13.366 --> 34:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, you said
that the Cruz amendment
is going to be key.

34:16.200 --> 34:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Senator McConnell also
said that Thursday, they
are going to see a text.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are going to they
handle the Cruz amendment?

34:20.933 --> 34:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

34:23.033 --> 34:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a bit of a tricky --
it's actually - - think of it
as two different bills, a bill

34:25.633 --> 34:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A and a bill B. It
will be the same text.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only, one will have the Cruz
amendment, one will not.

34:29.966 --> 34:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big moment to decide which
goes forward will be Monday,
probably, when we expect the

34:34.033 --> 34:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressional Budget Office
to come out with its score to
say, does the Cruz amendment

34:38.033 --> 34:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help these markets, what does
it do for premiums, what does it
do for preexisting conditions?

34:42.266 --> 34:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That will be the
big decision moment.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And in your spot,
you said that they still don't
have the 50 votes for what

34:47.366 --> 34:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is probably going to
come out Thursday.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they going to continue
to tweak it to try to
get the votes they need?

34:52.800 --> 34:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or how is that going to work?

34:54.433 --> 34:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
that's why we didn't
see text today, John.

34:56.366 --> 34:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why saw sort of a
framework and Vice President
Pence up there trying to massage

34:59.200 --> 35:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people into this.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, honestly, coming out of
the meeting, some people were
more warm to it, like Bob

35:03.600 --> 35:06.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Corker today.

35:06.133 --> 35:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others, like Lisa
Murkowski, came out, was
there, was there progress
made on things important

35:09.000 --> 35:10.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you?

35:10.166 --> 35:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She turned to reporters
and just said no.

35:11.900 --> 35:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: So, there's
still some work to go
for someone like that.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have got two
extra weeks now.

35:16.833 --> 35:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What else are they going to do?

35:18.900 --> 35:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are there other things they
have got to get done before
they get their reward by going

35:22.233 --> 35:23.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home for recess?

35:23.233 --> 35:24.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:24.433 --> 35:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well,
here's the thing.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they take the vote on health
care next week, there are
many who think it could fail

35:28.400 --> 35:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that Mitch McConnell
will let it fail.

35:30.300 --> 35:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At that point, then, they would
have another decision to make.

35:33.066 --> 35:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we try again, a different
kind of Republican bill, or do
we in fact work with Democrats,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come up with an entire 'nother
approach to health care to try
to fix the Obamacare markets?

35:41.333 --> 35:44.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do we try and pass
that before we leave in
the middle of August?

35:44.866 --> 35:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then they also have a budget
to deal with, spending bills.

35:47.666 --> 35:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives want to actually
do a proper spending process
and debate spending cuts,

35:51.233 --> 35:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than just have one
big bill dropped on at once.

35:54.133 --> 35:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a lot of work to do.

35:56.200 --> 35:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear how they will
get the votes to do it, though,
but now they do have more

35:59.000 --> 36:01.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

36:01.033 --> 36:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins,
a lot of work for them,
a lot of work for you.

36:04.066 --> 36:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

36:11.066 --> 36:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking
of the efforts to replace the
Affordable Care Act, let's

36:17.633 --> 36:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
continue hearing how
some citizens and health
care providers see it.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Producer Jason Kane visited
a pair of clinics in the
heart of coal country.

36:27.500 --> 36:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, we took you to the
town of Wise, Virginia, in a
state that opted not to expand

36:33.533 --> 36:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid for
low-income residents.

36:35.900 --> 36:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just across the border, in West
Virginia, the Affordable Care
Act and its Medicaid expansion

36:42.866 --> 36:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meant the rate of uninsured
residents dropped from at least
21 percent before the law took

36:48.933 --> 36:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect to 9 percent in 2015,
and nearly a third of families
in the state do get Medicaid.

36:54.733 --> 36:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 83 percent of
Mingo County voted for the
president in the election.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the state has been ravaged
by the opioids epidemic.

37:05.333 --> 37:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the Williamson Health
and Wellness Center, nerves
are now on edge as patients

37:11.200 --> 37:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recount their personal stories.

37:13.266 --> 37:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA HICKS, West Virginia:
My name's Rebecca Hicks, and I'm
from Chattaroy, West Virginia.

37:18.733 --> 37:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm 37 years old.

37:19.733 --> 37:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
When I was younger, I was raped.

37:21.500 --> 37:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess I got on drugs to cope
with it, regular pain pills.

37:26.033 --> 37:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, it started with, you
know, snorting the pills.

37:29.866 --> 37:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then it led to
shooting the pills.

37:33.333 --> 37:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have always
struggled to have a doctor.

37:37.233 --> 37:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this place kind of
takes care of all of it.

37:41.466 --> 37:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My access to Medicaid has helped
me pay for medicines that I
would never have been able

37:48.833 --> 37:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay for and to see
specialists that I wouldn't
be able to see if I
didn't have that medical

37:59.400 --> 38:01.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

38:01.133 --> 38:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEROME CLINE, Family
Nurse Practitioner: My
name's Jerome Cline.

38:02.066 --> 38:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm a family nurse practitioner.

38:05.800 --> 38:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the passage of the
Affordable Care Act, the state
had expanded Medicaid programs.

38:09.966 --> 38:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it's just under
50 percent of our patients,
I think, are Medicaid.

38:13.466 --> 38:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VICKI HATFIELD, Family
Nurse Practitioner: My
name is Vicki Hatfield.

38:15.466 --> 38:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a certified family
nurse practitioner and a
certified diabetes educator.

38:20.166 --> 38:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once we started seeing more
patients qualify for Medicaid,
they were able to come in, and

38:27.066 --> 38:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were able to start getting
them caught up on their
preventive screenings and health

38:30.466 --> 38:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promotion activities, and
just be able to treat their
chronic illnesses that had been

38:36.700 --> 38:38.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neglected.

38:38.666 --> 38:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The increased funds for Medicaid
services brought more revenue
into the clinic, so that

38:44.266 --> 38:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
allowed us to hire
more people here.

38:47.466 --> 38:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also allowed us to do some
other things in the community
to promote healthy living.

38:53.833 --> 38:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: We have a
farmers market every Saturday.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICKI HATFIELD: We also had
community gardens start.

38:59.400 --> 39:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we see more people
growing their own vegetables.

39:03.200 --> 39:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: We have a
community 5K almost every month.

39:09.566 --> 39:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we have a community
health worker program.

39:12.266 --> 39:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's certainly a lot of cheaper
to keep people healthy at home
than it is once they get into

39:15.233 --> 39:17.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

39:17.266 --> 39:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VICKI HATFIELD: Now, as we watch
what's happening with possible
repeal or replacement of the

39:22.400 --> 39:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act,
it's very concerning.

39:25.166 --> 39:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know patients are concerned,
particularly patients who
had chronic diseases that now

39:32.066 --> 39:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're able to get
medications for, or patients
who need annual screening.

CONNIE SUE MAHON, West Virginia:
I have got a head injury.

39:39.033 --> 39:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got a sleeping disorder.

39:40.066 --> 39:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got back problems.

39:41.733 --> 39:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got knee problems.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have panic attacks.

39:49.933 --> 39:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Connie Sue Mahon.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need the medical.

39:54.066 --> 39:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they take it, it's
going to hurt a lot of
families in West Virginia.

39:59.666 --> 40:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Trump promised
us a better plan.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we all voted to get him
in there because we thought
he'd do this country better.

40:05.066 --> 40:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if we ain't got that
medical, we won't have nothing.

40:08.966 --> 40:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's how people
in Mingo County live.

40:10.566 --> 40:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERINEL TAYLOR, West Virginia:
My name is Jerinel Taylor.

40:12.333 --> 40:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm 58 years old.

40:13.866 --> 40:15.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have diabetes.

40:15.300 --> 40:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to have the medication
to keep the diabetes down.

40:22.033 --> 40:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't, you lose your
eyes, your kidneys, and all this
stuff, so I try to keep up with

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started receiving the Medicaid
after the Obamacare, the
Affordable Care Act, or whatever

40:29.900 --> 40:32.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it was called.

40:32.033 --> 40:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the care I receive here,
my numbers have come down, my
blood pressure, and they keep

40:34.800 --> 40:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything pretty much took
care of for me, the mammograms
and all the cancer screenings

40:40.500 --> 40:42.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I need.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Affordable Care Act has helped
me, but it has hurt other
people, especially people like

40:44.800 --> 40:45.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my brother.

40:45.933 --> 40:46.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's hurt him.

40:46.933 --> 40:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he works hard.

40:49.033 --> 40:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they take it out
of his taxes because he
doesn't have insurance.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He can't afford the insurance
under the Affordable Care Act.

40:53.966 --> 40:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it has hurt him.

40:55.666 --> 40:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, if they drop
me, they drop me.

40:58.066 --> 41:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: Thinking about
the possible changes to the
health care system and the

41:05.433 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive to save money
with Medicaid, I'm
not sure if there's an
accounting of these people

41:10.833 --> 41:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now seeking their primary care
through the E.R.s, when they
can come here and the visit,

41:14.866 --> 41:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pay a small co-pay, vs.
going to the E.R., and all of
a sudden, it's a $2,000 bill.

41:21.833 --> 41:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REBECCA HICKS: About
two years ago, I had
been in the hospital,
like in the mental ward

41:26.300 --> 41:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for my mental health
at least 25 times.

41:28.800 --> 41:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I have hadn't
had to be hospitalized
for over two years,
because of all the doctors

41:36.766 --> 41:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here that has helped me so much.

41:40.266 --> 41:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEROME CLINE: Especially now,
with the drug epidemic around
here, what are we going to

41:44.266 --> 41:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do with the people who
have found an improved
quality of life, and
they have moved beyond,

41:51.333 --> 41:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know, a life of
addiction, and we have
got them into recovery?

41:55.033 --> 41:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we curtail that
treatment, what potentially
happens to those patients?

41:59.366 --> 42:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VICKI HATFIELD: I would
like to see the Medicaid
expansion continue.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would like to see
also a revision for
some of the premiums.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have some patients who did not
qualify for Medicaid expansion,
but they also could not

42:15.166 --> 42:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
afford the premium
and the deductible.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that needs
to be revisited.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are good parts
to the program, but there are
also some things that do need

42:25.200 --> 42:27.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
improvement.

42:27.233 --> 42:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA HICKS: I would tell
the politicians that they might
want to think real hard about

42:32.733 --> 42:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it and take a break from it a
little bit until they know more
about it, because what they're

42:37.733 --> 42:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealing is, if they take
health care away from somebody
that's an addict, they're going

42:45.333 --> 42:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to resort to worser things.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I chose those people.

42:50.633 --> 42:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I put my faith in those people
that they would make this
place better, not take away the

42:59.033 --> 43:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only things that were
helping this area.

43:06.733 --> 43:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraqi leaders
and the top American military
commander in Iraq proclaimed the

43:21.900 --> 43:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
liberation of the city
of Mosul yesterday.

43:24.966 --> 43:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the next step
in that war-torn country?

43:27.733 --> 43:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does the Iraqi government have
a plan to prevent ISIS from
returning and to rebuild Iraq's

43:33.466 --> 43:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
second largest city?

43:34.900 --> 43:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For some answers, we
turn to Feisal Istrabadi.

43:37.933 --> 43:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a former Iraqi diplomat,
and he's now director of the
Middle East Center at Indiana

43:42.900 --> 43:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
University, Bloomington.

43:44.366 --> 43:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Feisal Istrabadi, welcome
back to the program.

43:47.733 --> 43:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How much of a blow to
ISIS was the retaking
of the city of Mosul?

43:54.700 --> 43:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI, Former Deputy
Iraqi Ambassador to United
Nations: Well, it's a huge blow,

43:56.800 --> 44:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because one of the ways in which
ISIL distinguished its brand
from al-Qaida before was that it

44:03.166 --> 44:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was able to conquer and
hold territory, erase an
international boundary,
declare a caliphate,

44:10.666 --> 44:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and engage in the fight against
forces that regard it as
infidel, be they other Muslims

44:16.400 --> 44:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or Western forces.

44:18.866 --> 44:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it sort of distinguished
itself in that way.

44:21.633 --> 44:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now it is retreating.

44:22.900 --> 44:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It has lost the largest
city that it occupied.

44:26.200 --> 44:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are plans under way to
make it lose Raqqa as well
in Syria, and slowly -- and

44:32.366 --> 44:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hopefully not slowly
to expel it from Iraq.

44:34.900 --> 44:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's a psychological and an
ideological, huge blow to ISIL.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
does it still control?

44:42.633 --> 44:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What capability
does it still have?

44:45.200 --> 44:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: Well, it still
has the ability - - I mean, your
own reporting earlier in the

44:49.100 --> 44:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program was that it still is
able to put on sort of the
skirmish attacks, although, last

44:56.366 --> 45:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week, it was able to
manage to conduct an
attempt at a counterattack,
which was repelled,

45:01.933 --> 45:04.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of course.

45:04.033 --> 45:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the main fear that
I have now is that ISIL
becomes a classical
terrorist organization,

45:09.900 --> 45:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as al-Qaida was before, able
to pull off, you know, attacks
of varying size in Baghdad

45:16.533 --> 45:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other places.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're already seeing that
it is metamorphosing into
that kind of an organization.

45:23.833 --> 45:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that again is
deeply disturbing.

45:25.700 --> 45:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how
well-equipped is the government
of Iraq to deal with that?

45:30.033 --> 45:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: It's
very difficult to repel
those sorts of attacks.

45:36.966 --> 45:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to have perfect
intelligence and a perfect
ability to respond.

45:40.733 --> 45:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, unfortunately, neither the
Iraqi government now, nor the
Americans when they had a large

45:47.700 --> 45:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presence, when the U.S. had a
large presence in Iraq, have
been able to control that.

45:51.833 --> 45:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ultimate solution for this
problem has to be political.

45:56.100 --> 46:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to be a situation where
sort of the underlying disease
which has allowed at least

46:03.833 --> 46:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
enough people to fail
to participate in the
political process, that
sort of disease has

46:10.833 --> 46:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be treated, rather than
continuing to treat the
symptoms of the disease.

46:15.166 --> 46:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, we have collectively,
the Iraqis, the international
community, we have collectively

46:21.333 --> 46:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
failed to do that
over the years.

46:23.433 --> 46:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're referring
to the sectarian divisions in
Iraq that have led to one group

46:26.833 --> 46:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prevailing over another.

46:28.866 --> 46:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see any improvement in
the Shia-Sunni divisions in
Iraq over the last several years

46:34.866 --> 46:37.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
since the larger
war ended there?

46:37.166 --> 46:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: I see hope
that the future need not
be what the past has been.

46:44.333 --> 46:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, in distinction
to his predecessor, the current
prime minister of Iraq has good

46:51.033 --> 46:52.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intentions.

46:52.300 --> 46:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What we don't have,
however, is a plan.

46:54.400 --> 46:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Good intentions will not get
us past this sort of impasse
that we have been in since

47:00.633 --> 47:03.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after 2003.

47:03.466 --> 47:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There needs to be a coming
together of the Iraqi political
class, and a sort of a sorting

47:10.433 --> 47:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of what our priorities are
and how we prepare our modus
vivendi, how we engage in

47:17.500 --> 47:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reconciliation, what kinds of
power-sharing we're willing
to engage, all within a larger

47:23.600 --> 47:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
constitutional,
democratic framework.

47:26.433 --> 47:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that, unfortunately,
we haven't done.

47:30.133 --> 47:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we have to do it at
the same time as we have the
reconstruction of the country

47:34.233 --> 47:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at hand, as well, of course, as
providing immediate humanitarian
relief for the refugees

47:39.200 --> 47:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fleeing the cities that are
being liberated from ISIL.

47:44.033 --> 47:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when you
speak of we having to do this,
are you referring to the United

47:47.866 --> 47:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States or are you referring
to the Iraqi government?

47:50.266 --> 47:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: All of us.

47:52.633 --> 47:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that is something
that the international
community, the United
States, of course the

48:00.533 --> 48:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqis in the first instance
-- it has to be an Iraqi
project in the first instance.

48:05.433 --> 48:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the United States is
a part of the process.

48:09.533 --> 48:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The international community
needs to encourage these three
tracks, sort of the immediate

48:16.500 --> 48:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
humanitarian relief,
the physical rebuilding
of the country, and,
more importantly, the

48:21.333 --> 48:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political rebuilding
of the country.

48:23.433 --> 48:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is going to be sort of
a multipronged effort that
has to occur simultaneously.

48:28.066 --> 48:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the Iraqis will
need the support of the
international community.

48:31.333 --> 48:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very, very
quickly, you see the will of
the international community

48:35.166 --> 48:37.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that?

48:37.300 --> 48:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: I hope
so, because the failure
of the Iraqis to do
this, the failure of the

48:43.166 --> 48:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
international community
to support this effort
will mean that, just
as al-Qaida left ISIL,

48:48.966 --> 48:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this incarnation of ISIL will
lead to ISIL 2.0, 3.0, 4.0.

48:55.933 --> 48:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's just condemning the
Middle East, the region and
perhaps the world to an endless

48:59.266 --> 49:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cycle of violence.

49:00.566 --> 49:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
sobering message.

49:02.266 --> 49:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Feisal Istrabadi, we
thank you very much.

49:05.500 --> 49:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: Thank you.

49:10.500 --> 49:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a pleasure, as always.

49:17.500 --> 49:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Since
her nomination as U.S.
Secretary of Education,
Betsy DeVos has become

49:23.800 --> 49:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the more polarizing
figures in the Trump Cabinet,
often over school choice.

49:30.733 --> 49:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But her early tenure marks a big
departure from her predecessors
when it comes to higher

49:35.066 --> 49:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
education and student loans.

49:36.766 --> 49:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's the focus
of our Making the Grade
conversation tonight.

49:40.533 --> 49:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has more.

49:42.566 --> 49:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Late in the Obama
administration, new rules were
established to allow student

49:45.233 --> 49:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borrowers to have their debt
erased if they'd been victims
of fraud by for-profit schools.

49:52.233 --> 49:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as the new rules were set
to take effect this month,
the new administration called

49:54.766 --> 49:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a freeze, with Secretary
DeVos saying they were created
in a -- quote -- "muddled

49:59.766 --> 50:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process that's unfair to
students and schools."

50:02.933 --> 50:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Days ago, 18 states and
the District of Columbia
responded to that with
a lawsuit challenging

50:08.800 --> 50:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Education Department.

50:10.900 --> 50:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The freeze is just one
in a series of moves by
the new administration
that take a different

50:14.666 --> 50:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach to student loans
from its predecessor.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anya Kamenetz covers education
for NPR, and joins us now.

50:22.133 --> 50:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Anya, first, remind us
the extent of this problem, of
students on the hook with loans

50:28.733 --> 50:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to for-profit colleges
and all the criticisms
of predatory practices.

50:31.800 --> 50:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANYA KAMENETZ, NPR: So,
for-profit colleges at
their height enrolled
about one in 10 students

50:38.233 --> 50:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nationwide, and they're not just
your old cosmetology school.

50:41.566 --> 50:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are national and in many
cases online programs that
targeted working families.

50:48.566 --> 50:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, without painting the entire
sector with the same brush, we
did see over the last decade

50:51.766 --> 50:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many, many different
actions against for-profit
colleges, accusing them of
predatory and fraudulent

50:58.966 --> 51:01.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment.

51:01.066 --> 51:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were two large
colleges that shut down in the
last two years, Corinthian and

51:04.133 --> 51:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ITT Tech, with collectively
tens of thousands of students.

51:07.333 --> 51:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All
right, so I mentioned
the Obama administration,
they put in rules to

51:11.100 --> 51:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
address the problem, and
they created a so-called
borrower defense.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

51:17.833 --> 51:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: So, borrower
defense to repayment had been
a law on the books for a while.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was sort of a
case-by-case ability or
pathway for a borrower
who had been defrauded

51:28.733 --> 51:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by a college to be able
to escape their loans.

51:31.966 --> 51:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened was,
with tens of thousands of
students affected by the
ITT Tech and Corinthian

51:36.733 --> 51:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shutdown, there was a real
need to clarify and to
simplify that regulation.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, after a very
long negotiated public
process, borrower
defense to repayment was

51:47.566 --> 51:49.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put in place.

51:49.566 --> 51:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And basically what it said
was that students could have
their repayment automated, they

51:54.400 --> 51:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't have to
apply case by case.

51:56.400 --> 52:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it included a really
important clause that students
wouldn't have to agree to waive

52:02.566 --> 52:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their rights through
arbitration, so that
when -- you know, many
of these for-profit

52:05.433 --> 52:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleges had a rule on the
books that when you applied,
you said, we're not -- I'm not

52:09.100 --> 52:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to sue you and I
agree to arbitration.

52:11.700 --> 52:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that
borrower defense included as
well, which is pretty important

52:15.233 --> 52:17.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

52:17.333 --> 52:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
so that was supposed to
go into effect on July 1.

52:18.833 --> 52:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Betsy DeVos put that on hold.

52:21.566 --> 52:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is her argument?

52:23.000 --> 52:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, of course, the states
jumped in with a lawsuit.

52:25.933 --> 52:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what's the counterargument?

52:27.933 --> 52:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: So, we should
mention that, in addition to
pressing pause or hitting reset

52:31.666 --> 52:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on borrowed defense
to repayment, which is
like the remedy, Betsy
DeVos also has rolled

52:38.666 --> 52:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back something called gainful
employment, which you might
think of as the prevention.

52:41.166 --> 52:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And gainful employment
also regulates for-profit
colleges and other
career programs based on

52:46.533 --> 52:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the debt-to-income
ratio of their students.

52:48.633 --> 52:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, with those two in mind, the
lawsuit essentially says that
it's a violation of law for the

52:54.833 --> 52:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Education Department to
unilaterally strike down this
rule after this very, very long

52:59.366 --> 53:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and public negotiation process.

53:01.466 --> 53:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with the reset button
being hit, what we saw this
week is consumer advocates and

53:08.200 --> 53:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students once again taking to
the podium to testify and talk
about their experiences and

53:14.566 --> 53:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why they believe that these
two rules should stay in place.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, just in
our last minute now, I just
want to expand to more generally

53:20.933 --> 53:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look at the overall
student loan problem.

53:23.766 --> 53:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where do you see the major
differences and the major
flash points now with
the new administration?

53:28.700 --> 53:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: Well, I think we
saw, with Obama taking office
right around the financial

53:35.800 --> 53:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
crisis, the creation of
the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, which
became a major watchdog

53:38.633 --> 53:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on behalf of students, and many,
many actions taken against the
for-profit sector, but really

53:44.833 --> 53:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also against student
lenders in general.

53:47.200 --> 53:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been a real atmosphere
of, I would say, crackdown
in regulation and consumer

53:52.800 --> 53:55.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advocacy.

53:55.266 --> 53:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tenor has
certainly changed in
terms of the announcements
coming out of the DeVos

53:58.666 --> 54:00.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

54:00.833 --> 54:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has hired former for-profit
college students - - sorry --
she has hired former for-profit

54:04.266 --> 54:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college executives to advise
her, as well as putting in
charge of federal student aid

54:10.433 --> 54:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the CEO of a private
student loan company.

54:12.533 --> 54:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She has made a lot of
announcements on behalf
of things that will
save taxpayers money and

54:19.266 --> 54:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead to less burden on
colleges and universities,
including for-profit colleges.

54:22.133 --> 54:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so a lot of her statements
really made clear that she
doesn't intend to impose onerous

54:26.866 --> 54:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulatory burdens
on either for-profit
colleges or other types of
colleges, as well as the

54:32.733 --> 54:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
student loan industry as well.

54:34.266 --> 54:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Anya Kamenetz
of NPR, thank you very much.

54:36.833 --> 54:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANYA KAMENETZ:
Thank you, Jeffrey.

54:38.833 --> 54:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And thanks
to Jeff and to Anya.

54:41.433 --> 54:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:43.366 --> 54:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wednesday, our Russia
series goes to the country's
southern border, and asks why so

54:48.900 --> 54:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many Russians have joined ISIS.

54:51.033 --> 54:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:52.500 --> 54:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

54:54.566 --> 54:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
