04:11.218 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TECH INDUSTRY HAS WANTED AND

04:12.552 --> 04:14.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USES FOR A LONG TIME.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES LIKE IBM, MICROSOFT,

GOOGLE HAVE BEEN BRINGING IN

04:18.225 --> 04:20.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE WORKERS FOR A LONG TIME.

04:20.727 --> 04:22.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEY ARGUE IS THAT THERE IS

04:22.496 --> 04:23.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST NOT ENOUGH AMERICAN

04:23.964 --> 04:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

JOBS THAT THEY NEED.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THEY NEED TO BRING IN

04:32.739 --> 04:34.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE WORKERS FROM OVERSEAS WHO

04:34.141 --> 04:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED IN THESE

04:41.281 --> 04:42.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL EVER SINCE IT WAS

04:42.415 --> 04:43.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTRODUCED, THERE HAVE BEEN

04:43.083 --> 04:44.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE COMPLAINING THAT THIS IS

04:44.518 --> 04:46.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING AWAY AMERICAN JOBS.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY

04:47.320 --> 04:47.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, WE HEAR ALL ABOUT HOW

04:49.789 --> 04:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE

04:51.324 --> 04:53.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING LOWER-SKILLED JOBS FROM

04:53.360 --> 04:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN WORKERS BUT THAT

04:54.961 --> 04:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUMENT HAS ABSOLUTELY CARRIED

04:56.696 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER INTO THE HIGH-TECH FIELD.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE ARGUMENT IS THAT A LOT

04:59.466 --> 05:02.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THESE COMPANIES THAT PEOPLE

05:02.269 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLAIM ARE FIRING AMERICAN

05:04.271 --> 05:05.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS, AMERICAN COMPUTER

05:05.472 --> 05:07.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:07.107 --> 05:09.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEMS ANALYSTS, I.T. WORKERS,

05:09.276 --> 05:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GETTING RID OF THEIR HIGHER

05:11.144 --> 05:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALARIES AND REPLACING THEM WITH

05:12.712 --> 05:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE H-1B WORKERS, WHO CAN COME

05:15.115 --> 05:16.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN, IN SOME CASES, AND DO THE

05:16.283 --> 05:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK FOR CHEAPER.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SOME CASES, FOR EXAMPLE, LAST

05:19.786 --> 05:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR DISNEY WORLD WAS ACCUSED OF

05:21.621 --> 05:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAYING OFF HUNDREDS OF WORKERS

05:23.456 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVEN HAVING THEM TRAIN

05:25.025 --> 05:27.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR INDIAN REPLACEMENTS TO

05:27.294 --> 05:28.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE OVER THEIR JOBS.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

05:30.564 --> 05:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOTTEN A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY

05:31.631 --> 05:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPSET AND A LOT OF TRACTION

05:32.699 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLICAN

05:34.968 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:36.369 --> 05:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:37.237 --> 05:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENT OF THE LAW AS IT WAS

05:38.471 --> 05:39.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESIGNED, SO HOW DOES THE TRUMP

05:39.706 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO FIX IT?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT

05:43.310 --> 05:44.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE

05:44.878 --> 05:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP SITS.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN HIS

05:48.081 --> 05:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION, FOR EXAMPLE,

05:49.249 --> 05:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS

05:50.717 --> 05:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN RAILING AGAINST THE

05:51.985 --> 05:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
H-1B PROGRAM FOR YEARS.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WE SAW JUST ON MONDAY THE

05:56.990 --> 05:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ISSUE A

05:58.658 --> 05:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

H1-B APPLICATIONS, SAYING

06:02.028 --> 06:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS

06:03.129 --> 06:05.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO INCREASE THEIR AUDITS

06:05.699 --> 06:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF AMERICAN COMPANIES AND

06:07.100 --> 06:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERSEAS COMPANIES THAT USE

06:08.501 --> 06:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE H-1B VISAS, TO CRACK DOWN

06:10.737 --> 06:12.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABUSE AND TO MAKE CLEAR THAT

06:12.939 --> 06:14.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO ALLOW JUST

06:14.174 --> 06:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY ENTRY-LEVEL COMPUTER

06:16.009 --> 06:17.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRAMMERS TO COME IN THROUGH

06:17.444 --> 06:19.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE H1-B PROGRAM, TO REALLY

06:19.346 --> 06:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOCUS THE PROGRAM ON WHAT IT WAS

06:21.815 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENDED TO DO-- THESE VERY HIGH

06:23.850 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKILLED, VERY HARD TO FIND

06:26.186 --> 06:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERTS TO BRING INTO THE UNITED

06:28.054 --> 06:28.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S THE

06:29.189 --> 06:30.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIPPLE EFFECT IF THESE AUDITS

06:30.457 --> 06:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE PLACE OR IF THE PROCESS

06:31.858 --> 06:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SLOWS DOWN?

06:33.193 --> 06:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS YOU'VE

06:35.028 --> 06:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT THESE TECH COMPANIES-- IT'S

06:35.962 --> 06:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY HARD TO GET THESE.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE'S, I

06:38.665 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OR

06:40.033 --> 06:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUR APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PUT

06:41.601 --> 06:43.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ACTUALLY GET GRANTED.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT IS ALREADY HARD TO PLAN

06:45.305 --> 06:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO

06:46.306 --> 06:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT AN APPLICATION IN, IT TAKES

06:47.307 --> 06:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVERAL MONTHS FOR IT TO COME

06:48.541 --> 06:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN, AND THEN, IF THE FEDERAL

06:50.076 --> 06:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT STARTS COMING IN AND

06:51.244 --> 06:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUDITING YOUR REQUEST AND THE

06:53.046 --> 06:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VISAS GRANTED, THAT CREATES MORE

06:56.216 --> 06:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCERTAINTY AND AS YOU KNOW VERY

06:57.784 --> 07:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, BUSINESSES NEED STABILITY.

07:00.053 --> 07:00.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NEED SOME SORT OF

WORKFORCE AND FUTURE IS GOING TO

07:04.658 --> 07:05.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK LIKE, SO THAT'S JUST GOING

07:05.492 --> 07:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

07:07.193 --> 07:08.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:36.135 --> 20:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY WANT THEIR KIDS

20:37.136 --> 20:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVING BACK INTO THEIR BASEMENT.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT THE

20:41.440 --> 20:43.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT IS GOING TO BE STUDYING,

20:43.776 --> 20:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN THE BROADER ECONOMIC

20:46.178 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THEIR

20:47.279 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATION.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL FOR A

20:49.648 --> 20:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL TO SAY, 80% OF OUR

20:52.218 --> 20:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATES ARE EMPLOYED WITHIN

20:53.686 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIX MONTHS OF GRADUATION.

20:55.454 --> 20:56.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THAT'S OFTEN

20:56.255 --> 20:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SELF-REPORTED DATA, FROM THE

20:57.423 --> 20:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATES.

20:58.557 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIX MONTHS AFTER GRADUATION

20:59.625 --> 21:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT WHERE

21:00.392 --> 21:01.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL BE FIVE OR TEN YEARS

21:01.827 --> 21:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER GRADUATION.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALSO AN AVERAGE.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO MAYBE ALL THE ENGINEERS ARE

21:07.500 --> 21:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOYED, BUT NONE OF THE FILM

21:08.567 --> 21:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJORS ARE.

21:09.668 --> 21:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE

21:10.936 --> 21:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRILLING DOWN, DEPARTMENT BY

21:11.904 --> 21:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENT, MAJOR BY MAJOR AND

21:14.406 --> 21:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN'T JUST RELY ON THE

21:15.341 --> 21:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOLS FOR THIS INFORMATION

21:16.408 --> 21:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE IT

21:17.376 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T DO A GREAT JOB

21:18.978 --> 21:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRACKING THEIR GRADUATES.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND THEY DON'T

21:20.746 --> 21:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO DO

21:22.081 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO-- I MEAN, IF ANYTHING, IT

21:23.449 --> 21:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPOSES THEIR COMPETITIVE

21:24.817 --> 21:25.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE

21:25.651 --> 21:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST OTHER SCHOOLS.

21:26.685 --> 21:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT, SO THEY HAVE AN

21:27.353 --> 21:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCENTIVE TO HIGHLIGHT THE

21:28.587 --> 21:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY GREAT SUCCESS STORIES.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN THEY HAVE GOOD NUMBERS

21:32.324 --> 21:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL BOAST ABOUT THOSE.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU HAVE

21:35.728 --> 21:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT OUTCOME SURVEYS THAT

21:37.596 --> 21:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES, THEY

21:39.265 --> 21:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE RESPONSE RATES OF 15%, 20%,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
25%.

21:42.668 --> 21:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S NOT REALLY TELLING YOU

21:43.569 --> 21:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE

21:44.303 --> 21:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATING CLASS.

21:45.704 --> 21:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YEAH, IF THEY HAVE A LOT OF

21:46.739 --> 21:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENTS OR GRADUATES GOING INTO

21:48.707 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEACHING OR SOCIAL WORK, WHICH

21:50.409 --> 21:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AREAS

21:51.810 --> 21:53.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR GRADUATES TO GO INTO, THEY

21:53.679 --> 21:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T PAY VERY WELL.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEIR EARNINGS NUMBERS MIGHT

21:56.282 --> 21:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT LOOK SO GOOD.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY MIGHT KEEP THAT QUIET.
