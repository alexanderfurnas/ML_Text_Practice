Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away. On the

00:07.708 --> 00:11.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEWSHOUR tonight: a fragile
ceasefire in Yemen is in danger

00:11.645 --> 00:16.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of collapsing, as U.N.-backed
peace talks are in motion. Also

00:16.283 --> 00:19.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ahead this Thursday: new
research finds what parents

00:19.253 --> 00:23.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worry about changes based on the
family's income. And,

00:23.690 --> 00:27.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fishermen's tales. What the
refugee crisis looks like to

00:27.294 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those living on the Greek island
of Lesbos. Plus, a galaxy far,

00:32.299 --> 00:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far away at a theater near you.
How "Star Wars" has captivated

00:37.104 --> 00:40.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fans for nearly four decades.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "Star Wars"

00:40.774 --> 00:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transcends genres in some ways.
It becomes whatever we bring to

00:45.212 --> 00:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. It's a western, it's science
fiction, it's fantasy, it's

00:48.282 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
philosophy, it's family drama.
It becomes a thing that all of

00:52.920 --> 00:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us can connect to on some level.
WOODRUFF: All that and more on

00:57.124 --> 01:02.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight's PBS NEWSHOUR. (BREAK)
WOODRUFF: The Republican-led

01:13.173 --> 01:16.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House of Representatives pushed
through a huge tax cut bill

01:16.743 --> 01:22.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, costing an estimated $680
billion over 10 years. The vote

01:22.516 --> 01:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was 318 to 109 for a package
that keeps alive an array of tax

01:28.322 --> 01:32.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
breaks for businesses and
families. It drew bipartisan

01:32.192 --> 01:36.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support. Speaker Paul Ryan says
they will vote tomorrow on a

01:36.096 --> 01:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
separate trillion-dollar
spending package to fund the

01:39.933 --> 01:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government in 2016. REP. PAUL
RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE

01:42.135 --> 01:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOUSE: We are where we are, and
we have a bipartisan compromise,

01:45.539 --> 01:47.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where, by the way, I think we've
got some good wins. And look,

01:48.008 --> 01:51.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats win some things, too.
That's the nature of bipartisan

01:51.111 --> 01:54.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compromises. And so, the way I
look at this is, we have made

01:54.781 --> 01:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best of the situation we
have. There are some really good

01:57.718 --> 02:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wins in here for the American
people. There are very good wins

02:01.321 --> 02:03.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in here for the economy, for job
creators, for taxpayers.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi says many Democrats

02:07.761 --> 02:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might shun the omnibus spending
bill, that's partly it ends a

02:11.965 --> 02:15.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
40-year ban on exporting oil,
and because it denies debt

02:15.969 --> 02:17.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relief to Puerto Rico. REP.
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY

02:17.971 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEADER: Many of our Democrats
still have some concerns about

02:21.575 --> 02:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is in the omnibus and what
isn't in the omnibus. And

02:23.844 --> 02:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particularly what isn't, and
that is what we wanted -- the

02:26.580 --> 02:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity for Puerto Rico to
do restructuring to declare

02:31.018 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bankruptcy. WOODRUFF: The Senate
may pass both bills tomorrow,

02:35.188 --> 02:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before adjourning for the year.
The man who bought the rifles

02:40.127 --> 02:44.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used in the San Bernardino
shootings was arrested today.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Enrique Marquez is accused of
conspiring to aid terrorists and

02:48.635 --> 02:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other federal charges. He
purchased the guns in 2011 and

02:53.140 --> 02:57.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2012 for his friend, Syed
Farook. This month, Farook and

02:57.511 --> 03:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot
14 people to death at a holiday

03:01.982 --> 03:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party. President Obama meets
with relatives of the San

03:05.786 --> 03:08.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernardino victims tomorrow, in
California. Today, he urged

03:09.022 --> 03:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans to be vigilant over
the holidays, but he said at

03:12.726 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this time, there's no credible
information of any new plot. He

03:16.430 --> 03:18.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spoke at the National
Counterterrorism Center in

03:18.799 --> 03:21.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McClain, Virginia, after getting
briefed on the current threat

03:21.835 --> 03:25.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES: Anyone

03:25.038 --> 03:29.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to harm Americans need to
know -- they need to know that

03:29.476 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're strong, we're resilient,
that we will not be terrorized.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have prevailed over much
greater threats than this. We

03:39.820 --> 03:43.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will prevail again. WOODRUFF:
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security

03:43.123 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Council moved to disrupt the
Islamic State group's revenue

03:46.660 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
flow. Security Council members
approved a resolution sponsored

03:50.097 --> 03:54.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the U.S. and Russia. It
targets money from smuggled oil

03:54.601 --> 03:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and looted antiquities, plus
ransom payments. Libya's two

03:59.673 --> 04:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rival governments agreed on a
unity deal today in the face of

04:03.210 --> 04:06.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a growing Islamic state
presence. Officials from the

04:06.413 --> 04:10.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
internationally recognized
parliament in eastern Libya, and

04:10.183 --> 04:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Islamic-backed one in
Tripoli, signed the agreement in

04:13.787 --> 04:17.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Morocco. It was not clear if all
of the country's warring groups

04:17.891 --> 04:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will go along. Russian President
Vladimir Putin says Moscow wants

04:22.963 --> 04:27.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
improved ties with Washington,
despite tensions over Syria and

04:27.267 --> 04:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ukraine. But, Turkey is a
different matter. In a year-end

04:31.071 --> 04:34.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
briefing today, Putin cited
Turkey's downing of a Russian

04:34.608 --> 04:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warplane last month. Then, he
used decidedly off-color

04:38.512 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
language to suggest the Turks
might have acted to gain favor

04:42.048 --> 04:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the U.S. VLADIMIR PUTIN,
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through

04:45.952 --> 04:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
translator): You asked whether
it was possible that a third

04:48.488 --> 04:51.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party is involved. I get your
inference, but we do not know

04:51.424 --> 04:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this. If someone in the Turkish
government decided to lick the

04:54.327 --> 04:56.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans in some of their
private parts -- well, I don't

04:56.596 --> 04:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know. I can imagine that on some
level, there were agreements.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Putin also confirmed,
for the first time, the presence

05:03.803 --> 05:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Russian forces in Eastern
Ukraine, but he said they are

05:07.274 --> 05:10.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not regular troops. Back this in
country, there's word that

05:10.944 --> 05:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
former House Speaker Dennis
Hastert is recovering from a

05:13.847 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stroke, six weeks ago. His
lawyer says Hastert is

05:17.017 --> 05:21.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hospitalized in Illinois. Last
October, the one-time Republican

05:21.087 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader pleaded guilty in a
hush-money scheme to hide

05:24.824 --> 05:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personal misconduct from decades
ago. He's to be sentenced in

05:28.895 --> 05:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
February. Defense Secretary
Ashton Carter acknowledged today

05:32.866 --> 05:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he used an unsecured, personal
e-mail account to conduct

05:36.870 --> 05:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government business, early in
his tenure. Carter was asked

05:39.806 --> 05:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about it during a stop in Iraq,
after a "New York Times" report.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ASH CARTER, SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE: What I was doing that I

05:45.912 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shouldn't have been doing until
a few months ago -- which meant

05:51.351 --> 05:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I was doing it longer than
I should have, I should have

05:53.620 --> 05:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been obviously -- is using my
iPhone, which has my personal

05:58.792 --> 06:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
email on it, to send messages to
my office. Administrative

06:07.033 --> 06:10.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
messages, not classified
information. WOODRUFF: Carter

06:10.203 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said he stopped doing that "a
few months ago." That was well

06:13.707 --> 06:16.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after Democratic presidential
front-runner Hillary Clinton was

06:17.010 --> 06:20.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticized for using her own
e-mail server as secretary of

06:20.780 --> 06:25.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state. On Wall Street, stocks
gave up all of yesterday's

06:25.285 --> 06:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gains, and then some. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average lost

06:28.555 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 250 points to close
back below 17,500, the NASDAQ

06:34.327 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fell 68 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 31. And, there's new

06:40.066 --> 06:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hope for paralyzed veterans who
want to walk again. The Federal

06:44.204 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Veterans Affairs Department will
begin paying for robotic legs to

06:48.742 --> 06:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
help vets with spinal cord
injuries. The powered

06:51.945 --> 06:58.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exoskeleton called a "Re-walk"
costs $77,000, a sum that's well

06:58.051 --> 07:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beyond what most veterans could
afford. Still to come on the

07:01.755 --> 07:04.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NEWSHOUR: how a fragile
ceasefire in Yemen impacts the

07:04.858 --> 07:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight against ISIS, a portrait
of parenting in the U.S., the

07:09.663 --> 07:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugee crisis takes a toll on
Greek fishermen, and much more.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(BREAK) WOODRUFF: Now, Yemen.
There were small signs of

07:27.814 --> 07:31.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
progress today at peace
negotiations, but no sign the

07:31.484 --> 07:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting will stop in a country
that's been wracked by conflict

07:35.121 --> 07:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for more than a year. Our chief
foreign correspondent Margaret

07:38.491 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Warner reports. MARGARET WARNER,
PBS NEWSHOUR CHIEF FOREIGN

07:41.127 --> 07:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORRESPONDENT: It doesn't look
like a cease-fire in Yemen this

07:44.064 --> 07:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week. Tanks are still blasting,
gunfire still cracking across

07:48.335 --> 07:53.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battle lines, and dozens being
killed. Each side blames the

07:53.473 --> 07:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:
(through translator): The

07:55.475 --> 07:57.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Houthis are the ones that
rejected the United Nations and

07:57.877 --> 08:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Security Council resolutions,
who carried out attacks and

08:00.880 --> 08:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struck residential homes and
civilians. And we are just

08:03.550 --> 08:08.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defending them. WARNER: The
strife started in fall 2014,

08:08.254 --> 08:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when Shiite Houthi rebels,
backed by Iran, overran broad

08:12.559 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
swaths of the country. They
seized the capital Sana'a from

08:16.162 --> 08:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government forces and militias
loyal to President Abd-Rabbu

08:20.033 --> 08:24.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mansour Hadi. He spent months in
exile in Saudi Arabia, returning

08:24.471 --> 08:29.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only after a Saudi-led coalition
of nine Sunni Arab states

08:29.709 --> 08:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
launched airstrikes in March
against the Houthis. Much of the

08:33.913 --> 08:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coalition's weaponry comes from
the U.S. and Britain. Fighting

08:37.650 --> 08:41.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was supposed to halt this week,
as U.N.-backed peace talks began

08:41.354 --> 08:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a small town in Switzerland.

SPECIAL ENVOY FOR YEMEN (through
translator): Our meeting comes

08:47.093 --> 08:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a crucial moment in which
threats and dangers abound and

08:50.096 --> 08:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenges are increasing both
locally and regionally. The

08:52.232 --> 08:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
failure to reach a solution will
have disastrous human and

08:55.034 --> 08:58.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
material consequences for the
nation. Anyone who does not

08:58.304 --> 09:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
participate in the solution is
effectively helping to

09:01.040 --> 09:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perpetuate the crisis. WARNER:
There's much at stake for the

09:03.977 --> 09:09.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. as well. Yemen is home to a
lethal al-Qaeda affiliate, AQAP,

09:09.282 --> 09:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which has tried to stage terror
attacks in the U.S. Yemeni

09:15.221 --> 09:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces and U.S. air power had
beaten back AQAP fighters, but

09:20.226 --> 09:23.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the chaos has enabled them to
regain much of that territory.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The strife has also made room
for a new branch of the Islamic

09:26.900 --> 09:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State group to take root. And
the fighting the Houthis is

09:30.570 --> 09:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diverting the Gulf countries
from the broader war against

09:33.540 --> 09:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS. What's more, it has
ravaged what was already the

09:38.077 --> 09:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arab world's poorest country.
Some 6,000 have been killed, and

09:42.248 --> 09:45.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 2 million people have
fled their homes. MAJED MOHAMMED

09:45.218 --> 09:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(through translator): We fled
due to the shelling and shooting

09:48.254 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that continues to happen there.
So I took my kids and came here.

09:51.291 --> 09:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: Majed Mohamed lives in
Taiz, Yemen's third largest

09:55.195 --> 09:59.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city. Many families like his
have found shelter in empty

09:59.332 --> 10:03.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school buildings, abandoned
because of the violence. Indeed,

10:03.036 --> 10:06.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entire neighborhoods now lie
empty. The U.N. estimates the

10:06.739 --> 10:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
humanitarian crisis has affected
21 million people, more than 80

10:11.644 --> 10:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent of the population. ALI
HAMED ALHAKAH (through

10:14.180 --> 10:16.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
translator): Some have fled to
the countryside, some have fled

10:16.749 --> 10:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country all together, and
some have fled to other cities.

10:19.486 --> 10:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This neighborhood has become a
town of ghosts. WARNER: Some aid

10:23.189 --> 10:26.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deliveries are getting to Yemen,
but distribution inside the

10:27.026 --> 10:30.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country has been nearly
impossible. Tarak Bach Baouab of

10:30.964 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Doctors Without Borders"
explains. TARAK BACH BAOUAB,

10:34.567 --> 10:37.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEAD OF MISSION IN YEMEN,
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDER: So it is

10:37.237 --> 10:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much difficult for humanitarian
workers to access those areas,

10:39.239 --> 10:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for convoys to reach sometimes
besieged areas, hospitals that

10:41.975 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are basically in areas which are
completely surrounded by

10:47.046 --> 10:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
checkpoints and where different
fighting parties are not

10:51.718 --> 10:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allowing humanitarian assistance
to get through. WARNER: U.S.

10:55.421 --> 10:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials hope these talks will
lead to a permanent cease fire

10:58.491 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a flow of aid. Today,
negotiators did agree to let

11:02.161 --> 11:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supplies into hard-hit Taiz and
elsewhere. And Houthis and

11:06.666 --> 11:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government fighters in Aden
exchanged hundreds of prisoners.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But a political settlement of
this devastating conflict still

11:14.908 --> 11:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks far away. SUBTITLE: In
Yemen, 19 million people lack

11:21.047 --> 11:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
access to safe water and over 14
million people are insecure.

11:28.521 --> 11:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Economic and racial
divides are very much a focus in

11:33.159 --> 11:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States right now,
whether through the lens of

11:35.795 --> 11:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criminal justice, education, or
income inequality. Today, a

11:40.300 --> 11:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
major new survey documents the
extent to which those divides

11:44.170 --> 11:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also play a role in parenting,
and the choices and concerns

11:48.141 --> 11:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mothers and fathers face. As an
example, the report released by

11:52.145 --> 11:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Pew Research Center finds
that lower-income parents tend

11:56.482 --> 12:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to worry that their child might
be a victim of violence, or run

12:00.053 --> 12:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into trouble with the police.
While higher-income parents are

12:03.323 --> 12:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more likely to worry that their
children's overly busy schedules

12:07.226 --> 12:10.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may be causing them stress. To
help us explore more of the

12:11.030 --> 12:14.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report's findings, and the
potential effects different

12:14.367 --> 12:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
child-raising practices might
have, we turn to Kim Parker of

12:18.571 --> 12:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Pew Research Center, and
Lawrence Aber, he's a professor

12:22.508 --> 12:27.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of psychology and public policy
at New York University. And we

12:27.313 --> 12:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welcome you both. Kim Parker,
broadly speaking, to start this

12:31.084 --> 12:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off, how much difference is
there in the parenting styles

12:34.554 --> 12:38.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and approaches of parents at the
lower end of the income scale

12:38.291 --> 12:41.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and at the upper-end? KIM
PARKER, PEW RESEARCH CENTER: I

12:41.794 --> 12:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think the differences are less
in their style and approach, and

12:43.830 --> 12:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more in their outlook and their
worries and concerns and their

12:45.832 --> 12:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aspirations. We found that for
lower income parents, their

12:49.369 --> 12:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
financial instability can really
limit their children's access to

12:52.872 --> 12:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a safe environment and the kinds
of extracurricular and enriching

12:56.709 --> 12:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activities that many more
affluent parents may take for

12:59.846 --> 13:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
granted. WOODRUFF: Well, for
example we saw, I think we have

13:02.782 --> 13:05.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a graphic to show this,
participating -- this is just

13:05.818 --> 13:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
participating in after school
activities. Families earning

13:08.021 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over $75,000 a year, 84 percent
of those children participate in

13:12.659 --> 13:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organized sports, 62 percent in
some sort of organized music and

13:16.329 --> 13:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
art. Under $30,000 income
families, 59 percent in sports,

13:21.834 --> 13:25.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still a significant percentage
but less, 41 percent in music

13:25.772 --> 13:27.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and art. I mean, that tells you
something. PARKER: It does. And

13:27.807 --> 13:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we also found, we asked about
after school programming for

13:31.344 --> 13:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids, you know, so many parents
are working now and the kids

13:34.113 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need somewhere to go after
school. And there was a lot of

13:36.349 --> 13:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concern among lower income
parents about the affordability

13:39.552 --> 13:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and availability of high quality
after school programs. And we

13:42.722 --> 13:45.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found that more affluent parents
are more likely to take

13:45.358 --> 13:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advantage of those kinds of
programs. And so, with after

13:48.394 --> 13:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school programs and also the
extracurriculars kids do on the

13:52.365 --> 13:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weekends, and in the evening,
those things take resources. And

13:55.134 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think for lower income
parents, there are just other

13:57.970 --> 13:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
places where they have to put
that money. WOODRUFF: Kim

13:59.972 --> 14:02.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parker, I was struck and we
cited some of this about how

14:02.542 --> 14:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents of these different
income levels, what they worry

14:05.078 --> 14:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about for their children. I
mean, there's a real difference

14:07.447 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there. PARKER: Real differences.
It was quite interesting to see.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We asked about a whole range of
different things that parents

14:13.653 --> 14:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be concerned about. And we
found that lower income parents

14:16.856 --> 14:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have really a different set of
concerns and they tend to

14:19.692 --> 14:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revolve around their children's
safety. So, they are more likely

14:22.962 --> 14:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to worry that their child might
be shot or be beat up or

14:26.499 --> 14:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacked or be kidnapped. And
all parents we found, the

14:31.137 --> 14:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overall -- the biggest concern
was that the child might be

14:34.207 --> 14:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bullied. But for more affluent
parents, the emotional

14:38.444 --> 14:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well-being of their kids,
whether they might be bullied or

14:40.747 --> 14:43.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suffer from depression or
anxiety, those things trump

14:43.850 --> 14:46.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those other types of safety
concerns that lower income

14:46.285 --> 14:49.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
parents have. WOODRUFF:
Professor Aber at New York

14:49.188 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University, does this -- how
does this track with what -- you

14:52.291 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have done a lot of research and
writing on this, how does it

14:55.027 --> 14:56.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
track with what you see?
LAWRENCE ABER, NEW YORK

14:57.029 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIVERSITY: Very, very well. I
think the Pew report is

15:00.032 --> 15:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important in getting these facts
out. Over the last two decades,

15:04.370 --> 15:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have increasingly realized
that the kinds of worries that

15:09.375 --> 15:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the report calls out for safety,
and the kinds of concerns that

15:16.249 --> 15:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents have of low income, that
they can't get their kids into

15:19.585 --> 15:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extracurricular activities.
These come from a real

15:22.155 --> 15:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
environment, differences that
children and their families live

15:24.590 --> 15:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in. Parents and children in the
upper income sector, and parents

15:26.826 --> 15:30.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and children in the lower income
sector are living in different

15:30.563 --> 15:35.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
neighborhoods, different
schools. And this affects

15:35.968 --> 15:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents' philosophies, attitudes
and behaviors. WOODRUFF: And it

15:39.138 --> 15:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affects -- Professor Aber, it
affects the time these parents

15:42.675 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can spend with their children
including at early age -- at an

15:45.711 --> 15:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
early age. ABER: It affects time
and it affects the opportunities

15:50.750 --> 15:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that children have. Parents have
two jobs, throughout their

15:53.452 --> 15:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children's minority. One job is
to protect them from safety and

15:57.190 --> 16:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to provide kind of security and
protect them from danger and

16:00.793 --> 16:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide them security and safety
to go out into the world. And

16:04.764 --> 16:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the second is when they go out
into the world, to provide

16:08.701 --> 16:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities to learn and to
develop. And these are both

16:12.271 --> 16:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that are affected by the
neighborhoods that they're in,

16:15.174 --> 16:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as witnessed by the data that
Pew has been reporting.

16:18.444 --> 16:21.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Kim Parker, what do
you see in terms of discipline

16:21.414 --> 16:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and expectations about school
performance? PARKER: We have

16:25.184 --> 16:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found some really interesting
findings about parental

16:27.453 --> 16:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involvement in schools. And we
found tht across the

16:30.189 --> 16:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
socioeconomic spectrum, parents
are very involved. The low

16:33.226 --> 16:37.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
income and high income parents
are just as likely to say that

16:37.763 --> 16:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they go to parent teacher
conferences and go to PTA

16:41.567 --> 16:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meetings. But we also asked
whether -- you know, do you wish

16:44.637 --> 16:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you could be more involved in
your child education, and we

16:46.839 --> 16:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found that lower income parents
are more likely than high income

16:49.208 --> 16:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents to say that they do wish
that they could be more

16:51.210 --> 16:53.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involved. And we had another
question where we pitted two

16:53.779 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opinions against each other. One
was, can you ever be too

16:57.884 --> 17:00.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involved in your child's
education or too much

17:00.486 --> 17:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involvement be sometimes a bad
thing? And higher income and

17:03.890 --> 17:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more real educated parents, a
majority of them said, you know,

17:06.792 --> 17:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too much involvement can be a
bad thing. But for the lower

17:09.161 --> 17:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
income parents, they said you
can never be too involved.

17:11.797 --> 17:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: It's fascinating.
Professor Aber, what are the

17:14.734 --> 17:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
implications of this for these
children as they grow up? ABER:

17:18.905 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the kind of thing that was
just describe where parents are

17:24.076 --> 17:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over-concerned, perhaps has to
be seen in this environmental

17:28.247 --> 17:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
context. The kind of things that
we're talking about really

17:31.984 --> 17:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affect two kinds of things. One
is children's language and

17:35.688 --> 17:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cognitive development, and the
second is their social and

17:38.024 --> 17:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emotional development -- the
soft skills, the interpersonal

17:41.093 --> 17:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skills. And these are the very
roots of inequality that we're

17:45.698 --> 17:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeing in this report. This is
how our nation is beginning to

17:49.702 --> 17:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pull apart. And we need to close
that so that parents' worries in

17:54.440 --> 17:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the low income neighborhoods are
reduced and the opportunities

17:58.177 --> 18:03.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for their kids are much, much
brighter. WOODRUFF: Kim Parker,

18:03.049 --> 18:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly, what do you see in
terms of the implications for

18:05.785 --> 18:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these children as they become
adults? PARKER: Well, I think

18:07.920 --> 18:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one thing that we haven't really
touched on is the sort of the

18:10.656 --> 18:13.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
backdrop for this is the
changing family structure. And

18:13.960 --> 18:16.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lower share of children that
are living in households with

18:16.796 --> 18:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two married parents is at a
record low now, 62 percent. And

18:20.232 --> 18:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a rising share of children that
are living in single parent

18:22.635 --> 18:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
homes, and they are different
economic outcomes for those

18:25.972 --> 18:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
types of families. If those
trends continue, this could have

18:28.808 --> 18:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real implications for children's
economic well-being going

18:31.477 --> 18:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forward. WOODRUFF: Yes, a lot to
think about and a lot for

18:35.348 --> 18:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policymakers to pay attention
to. Kim Parker with Pew Research

(BREAK) WOODRUFF: Stay with us,

18:55.067 --> 18:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming up on the NEWSHOUR: The
work of two detectives raises

18:58.671 --> 19:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questions of how police handle

latest figures from the United

19:13.719 --> 19:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nations Refugee Agency show that
more than 800,000 refugees and

19:18.491 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
migrants have landed in Greece
by sea during 2015. Most of them

19:23.796 --> 19:27.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have arrived on the island of
Lesbos, five miles from the

19:27.133 --> 19:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkish coast. The impact of the
crisis on the Greeks who live on

19:31.270 --> 19:34.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the island has been both
economic and profoundly

19:34.306 --> 19:37.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emotional, as special
correspondent Malcolm Brabant

19:37.443 --> 19:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reports. MALCOLM BRABANT, PBS
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:

19:40.179 --> 19:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2015 has been a transformative
year to every inhabitant of

19:44.150 --> 19:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lesbos, not least fisherman
Costas Finteris (ph). COSTAS

19:47.319 --> 19:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FINTERIS, FISHERMAN (through
translator): Up until this year,

19:49.321 --> 19:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sea for me meant fishing.
This year, it has changed

19:51.323 --> 19:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things. Now, it means fishing
for people. The consequences

19:53.325 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been a drop in my income
because when I see someone in

19:55.327 --> 20:00.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
urgent need when I'm out
fishing, I drop everything and

20:07.473 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go to help, because my work is
not as important as saving human

20:11.343 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lives. The worst thing is the
drowned people, drowned mothers,

20:15.981 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drowned children. BRABANT: One
of the worst days was in late

20:21.120 --> 20:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
October when a boat carrying 300
people capsized. More than 30,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including several children, lost
their lives. UNIDENTIFIED

20:38.104 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FINTERIS: The pictures I saw
during those incidents which I

20:41.240 --> 20:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was seeing almost on a daily
basis would come back to me

20:44.243 --> 20:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while I was trying to sleep in
bed at night. I kept seeing

20:47.413 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repeated pictures of the same
incidents as night mayors. I

20:50.382 --> 20:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
couldn't sleep at all. BRABANT:
The children of Lesbos are

20:53.652 --> 20:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing up on the front line of
the new Europe and here, they

20:58.257 --> 21:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are getting a practical lesson
in the Greek tradition of

21:02.428 --> 21:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"philoxenia" -- unconditional
hospitality and generosity to

21:05.531 --> 21:08.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strangers. They are brightening
up a new refugee camp on the

21:08.868 --> 21:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
northern coast, under the
direction of their teacher,

21:11.403 --> 21:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aphrodite Vatis. APHRODITE
VATIS, TEACHER: We want more

21:15.341 --> 21:17.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
language. If we can even put
other language, 100 percent we

21:17.343 --> 21:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want that, and other languages,
if you can find Farsi also.

21:20.513 --> 21:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRABANT: We met Aphrodite in
late October, as local

21:24.083 --> 21:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
volunteers helped to off load a
stricken boat in rough seas.

21:28.420 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VATIS: It's inhumane. It's
horrendous that they are putting

21:31.590 --> 21:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in boats, sending them
across in weather like this.

21:36.495 --> 21:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's changed, first of all, my
daily reality. I wake up now and

21:42.935 --> 21:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first thing I have to do is
go to my family's hotel and see,

21:46.705 --> 21:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are there boats arriving? How
can we help them? And this is in

21:49.575 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the morning. I have children, I
have a husband. I have my own

21:53.946 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business. And so, the daily
things that we take for granted,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was able to realize that I
took a lot of things for granted

22:00.719 --> 22:04.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very quickly, even just a moment
of free time, a moment of

22:04.657 --> 22:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending with your own children.
These are the things that I miss

22:07.993 --> 22:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because there is no more free
time. Also, moments of feeling

22:11.697 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carefree, they don't exist any
more because we see what is

22:15.401 --> 22:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on around us in other
parts of the world. It has come

22:19.805 --> 22:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to our doorstep. So, it's
something that you can't sleep

22:23.008 --> 22:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very easily at night any more
either. BRABANT: For most new

22:26.045 --> 22:28.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
arrivals, Lesbos is a
springboard to the rest of the

22:28.514 --> 22:33.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
European Union, but it's become
a base for Aslam Obeid, formally

22:33.185 --> 22:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an aid worker who's remained in
Greece to help his fellow

22:36.855 --> 22:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
travelers. While he is full of
praise for local people and

22:40.626 --> 22:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international volunteers, he's
disdainful of Europe's response.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ASLAM OBEID, AID WORKER FROM
DAMASCUS: What is Europe doing?

22:47.933 --> 22:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is forcing from -- to accept
these people but what are they

22:51.203 --> 22:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing? Paying trinkets, a few
billion euro to stop refugees

22:57.176 --> 23:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from coming. Yes, thank you,
Europe. Seriously thank you. Did

23:01.013 --> 23:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you spend one million for
helping. Europe has been paying

23:05.284 --> 23:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for transportation for people or
for helping. BRABANT: Latest

23:09.888 --> 23:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figures from the U.N. Refugee
Agency suggest that over 800,000

23:13.525 --> 23:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people have arrived in Greece by
sea this year. The average cost

23:18.097 --> 23:22.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the place from Turkey to
Lesbos is $1,000. That means the

23:22.635 --> 23:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
traffickers and Turkish side
could have made as much as $800

23:26.805 --> 23:29.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million. The Syrian and
fisherman have conflicting views

23:29.842 --> 23:33.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on this issue. OBEID: For me,
even, you call them heroes,

23:34.013 --> 23:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, they are helping others.
The smuggler (INAUDIBLE) $800,

23:40.619 --> 23:46.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the price is like $1,200 and
he just let him go. So, he's

23:46.959 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like even helping others. It's a
business. It's not like a

23:54.566 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(INAUDIBLE) or something.
FINTERIS: As far as I'm

23:58.671 --> 24:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerned, they are murderers
because the boats they are using

24:01.440 --> 24:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to push these people from Turkey
are not seaworthy for this

24:04.910 --> 24:07.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
passage. They are not suitable
for this part the Aegean.

24:07.946 --> 24:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRABANT: The topography of
Lesbos has metamorphosed as a

24:12.151 --> 24:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
result. This mountain of life
jackets behind me in northern

24:16.422 --> 24:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lesbos covers an area the size
of a soccer pitch. There are

24:19.825 --> 24:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
literally hundreds of thousands
of jackets here, every one

24:22.895 --> 24:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
representing a human life. But
the economic impact on Lesbos is

24:26.932 --> 24:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the main entry point to Europe
for these refugees and migrants

24:30.436 --> 24:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been seismic. The vacation
business on which so many people

24:34.807 --> 24:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
depend has collapsed. Two years
ago, the charm of Lesbos lured

24:40.045 --> 24:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
75,000 vacationers on package
tours on charter flights. And

24:44.817 --> 24:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the island had 60 lucrative
cruise liner stopovers in high

24:48.320 --> 24:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
season. But so far, projected
charter bookings and cruise ship

24:52.591 --> 24:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dockings for next year stand at
zero. VATIS: All our businesses,

24:56.462 --> 25:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have loans, we have to pay
the banks. Our biggest fear is

25:00.099 --> 25:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we won't be able to cover our
costs. If we can cover our costs

25:03.235 --> 25:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and get through the year, we
will be more than happy with

25:05.671 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, because we want to be able
to sustain our existence as long

25:10.442 --> 25:14.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as we can, until things turn and
we have an increase again in

25:14.179 --> 25:19.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tourism. BRABANT: Spending by
volunteers, aid agencies and the

25:22.354 --> 25:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
migrants to the tune of a
hundred million dollars has

25:25.391 --> 25:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offset some of the losses. But
the overall long-term picture is

25:29.061 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bleak. FINTERIS: My wish is that
the powers that be may work to

25:34.666 --> 25:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a solution so that people
may live in peace, that the

25:37.803 --> 25:41.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole world may live in peace.
BRABANT: But if anything, the

25:41.774 --> 25:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence is escalating, which
means that Lesbos' crucial

25:45.210 --> 25:48.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
position on the migrant trail
will continue. For the PBS

25:48.914 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEWSHOUR, I'm Malcolm Brabant in
Lesbos. (MUSIC) WOODRUFF: Now,

26:03.695 --> 26:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how one investigative journalism
project is shining light on how

26:07.800 --> 26:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police should handle rape
investigations -- and to Hari

26:11.103 --> 26:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sreenivasan. HARI SREENIVASAN,
PBS NEWSHOUR ANCHOR: On August

26:14.006 --> 26:17.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
11, 2008, an 18-year old
Washington woman reported she

26:17.443 --> 26:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been raped at knifepoint in
her apartment. Days later, after

26:21.580 --> 26:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police questioned her about
inconsistencies in her story,

26:24.383 --> 26:27.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the woman said she made the
whole thing up. Except, there's

26:27.352 --> 26:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more, "An Unbelievable Story of
Rape" is the joint effort by two

26:31.457 --> 26:34.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
non-profit news organizations,
The Marshall Project and

26:34.426 --> 26:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ProPublica, to tell the tale of
how two very different police

26:37.896 --> 26:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
departments treated the
investigation. We are joined now

26:41.166 --> 26:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by co-author Ken Armstrong, a
staff writer for The Marshall

26:44.503 --> 26:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Project. He joins from Seattle.
So, Ken, I want to ask, I want

26:48.340 --> 26:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to tell our audience that we are
going to talk about the ends of

26:51.376 --> 26:54.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this story as well f they hadn't
read it yet. But what happens to

26:54.646 --> 26:57.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this woman when she goes into a
police department in Linwood,

26:57.182 --> 26:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington, and tells them this
she has been raped? KEN

26:59.885 --> 27:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARMSTRONG, THE MARSHALL PROJECT:
Well, she tells police that she

27:03.255 --> 27:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was raped. And initially there
is no indication that police

27:06.925 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doubt the truth of what she is
telling them. But quickly, as

27:11.463 --> 27:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soon as one day after, she
reports being raped, doubts set

27:15.601 --> 27:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in. And it really originates
with the call that comes into

27:19.571 --> 27:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the police station from the
woman's foster mother. The

27:23.709 --> 27:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foster mother says that she has
questions about whether this had

27:27.212 --> 27:30.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really happened. She wonders if
maybe this was a bid for

27:30.349 --> 27:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attention. With that one phone
call, the focus of the

27:33.886 --> 27:37.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation shifts. And
instead of pursuing the evidence

27:37.623 --> 27:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is available to them, the
detectives decide to confront

27:41.293 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the victim in this case, to
confront Marie, about whether

27:45.297 --> 27:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she, what she has reported has
really happened. So, they bring

27:48.433 --> 27:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her into the police station. And
they interrogate her as a

27:51.670 --> 27:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criminal suspect, instead of
questioning her as a rape

27:55.807 --> 28:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victim. And you know, she was 18
years old. She had no experience

28:00.445 --> 28:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with police. In the face of this
interrogation, she took what

28:04.316 --> 28:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under the circumstances she
considered to be the easiest way

28:07.219 --> 28:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out, which was to say, "I lied
about what had happened." So

28:12.057 --> 28:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she, in essence, recanted
everything that she had said on

28:15.694 --> 28:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the morning of the rape. And as
a result of that, she wound up

28:19.398 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being charged with filing a
false police report.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Now, this is all
happening in Linwood,

28:24.369 --> 28:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington. How does this
connect to a case in Colorado?

28:26.939 --> 28:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARMSTRONG: Well, after she
admits to making the story up,

28:33.011 --> 28:37.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she takes a plea deal in which
she agrees to certain conditions

28:37.683 --> 28:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which include the need to get
counseling for lying about being

28:42.254 --> 28:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raped. And she agrees to go on
supervised probation for a year.

28:46.124 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two and a half years later, two
and a half years after she is

28:50.028 --> 28:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charged with filing a false
police report, a serial rapist

28:53.498 --> 28:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is arrested in Colorado. And
when police execute a search

28:58.036 --> 29:01.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warrant, they find in his
possession photographs which

29:01.640 --> 29:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turn out to prove definitively
that he had, indeed, raped Marie

29:07.613 --> 29:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Linwood two and a half years
before. SREENIVASAN: And then

29:11.083 --> 29:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what happens, you know, this is
a tale of two different police

29:14.653 --> 29:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
departments. But the police
department in Washington got

29:18.924 --> 29:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this wrong. What happened when
they figured this out?

29:21.627 --> 29:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARMSTRONG: It did. They were
confronted with the fact that

29:23.629 --> 29:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they had made a mistake of
dramatic proportions. Not only

29:26.832 --> 29:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had they not believed a woman
who had, indeed been raped. They

29:29.601 --> 29:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had gone further and they had
punished her. They had filed a

29:31.603 --> 29:33.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citation charging her with false
reporting. So, they had to find

29:33.605 --> 29:35.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her and go and tell her that she
had been right all along. They

29:35.607 --> 29:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now recognized that. And they
tried to find out ways that they

29:37.943 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could prevent this from
happening again. They ordered an

29:40.045 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
independent review and external
review to reconstruct the ways

29:46.351 --> 29:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in which they had gone off the
rails in this investigation.

30:02.834 --> 30:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, do police
departments around the country

30:06.238 --> 30:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep track of how many rapes are
reported, how many people recant

30:11.043 --> 30:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this? Because it seems like in
the general arc of domestic

30:14.680 --> 30:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence, that this would be a
common occurrence, that people

30:17.816 --> 30:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, "yes, he hit me", something
happened and they were perhaps

30:21.386 --> 30:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intimidated by their attacker to
say, "No, no, you know what, I'm

30:24.122 --> 30:26.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to press charges, it
wasn't rape, it was consensual."

30:26.258 --> 30:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARMSTRONG: Yes. They do keep
statistics. Local police

30:30.228 --> 30:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
departments report numbers to
the FBI, but it can be a pretty

30:34.566 --> 30:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
murky data set. In general, what
the FBI believes that about 5

30:40.839 --> 30:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent of rape cases turn out
to be unfounded. What's less

30:46.678 --> 30:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear is how often rape victims
are subsequently charged with

30:51.149 --> 30:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
filing a false police report.
That would be a fraction of that

30:54.386 --> 30:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fraction, but it's an unknown
number. SREENIVASAN: So, why did

30:57.489 --> 31:01.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Colorado department behave
so differently when they were

31:01.827 --> 31:05.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tracking their suspect based on
interviews that they had with

31:05.597 --> 31:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victims, versus the Washington
department? ARMSTRONG: You know,

31:10.469 --> 31:16.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the story proved to be a
remarkable contrast in the dos

31:16.308 --> 31:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and don'ts of investigating
rape. Everything that the police

31:19.911 --> 31:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Washington did wrong, the
police in Colorado did right.

31:24.082 --> 31:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They listened to their victims.
They pursue the evidence,

31:28.220 --> 31:31.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chasing every lead. They
coordinated with one another.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they didn't fall prey to
stereotypes about how someone

31:35.360 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is hurt should react. They
recognize that people react in

31:40.232 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all kinds of different ways to
trauma and they shouldn't fall

31:43.335 --> 31:47.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prey to these misguided
assumptions about somebody being

31:47.439 --> 31:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
un-credible simply because they
are not hysterical, necessarily,

31:52.377 --> 31:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or their body language in some
ways seems off. The police in

31:57.783 --> 32:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Colorado did a remarkable job of
identifying and arresting Mark

32:03.255 --> 32:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
O'Leary. SREENIVASAN: All right.
You can read about the rapes in

32:06.091 --> 32:08.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Colorado and the one in
Washington, in a fantastic

32:08.860 --> 32:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story. It's both on The Marshall
Project Web site and in

32:11.263 --> 32:13.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ProPublica Web site. Ken
Armstrong, thanks so much for

32:13.265 --> 32:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
joining us. ARMSTRONG: Thank
you, Hari. Appreciate it.

(MUSIC) WOODRUFF: Traditionally,
liberal arts colleges are not

32:33.151 --> 32:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
necessarily the place you'd look
to as an incubator for start-up

32:37.189 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ventures. But there's change in
the air, and some schools are

32:40.625 --> 32:43.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ready to move into new
territory. Our economics

32:43.595 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent, Paul Solman,
looks at why. It's part of our

32:46.765 --> 32:50.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weekly segment "Making Sense,"
which airs every Thursday on the

SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR ECONOMIC

32:52.204 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORRESPONDENT: What if all you
need to do to grow the perfect

32:54.472 --> 33:00.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
garden is to lay down a mat of
vegetable seeds, add water, and

33:00.812 --> 33:03.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wait? CAM MACKUGLER,
ENTREPRENEUR: So you have an

33:03.114 --> 33:06.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
optimally designed,
prefabricated garden that is

33:06.284 --> 33:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
embedded in a sheet. The idea
was, how can I simplify the

33:09.721 --> 33:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process of gardening so that
anybody can have a garden

33:12.757 --> 33:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without any work? SOLMAN: So,
this is gardening for the

33:15.126 --> 33:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vegetably-challenged? MACKUGLER:

33:32.944 --> 33:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years as a safe haven for the
liberal arts. Now it's spawning

MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE: You wear

33:42.854 --> 33:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goggles and you're able to look
through the goggles and actually

33:44.890 --> 33:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see the architectural rendering
of, maybe your new house or a

33:48.493 --> 33:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new building that you've asked
the architects to build. SOLMAN:

these projects are just two of

33:54.666 --> 33:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many now being cultivated in
northern Vermont, a lot of them

33:59.437 --> 34:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the campus's incubator space,
the old stone mill. UNIDENTIFIED

34:03.141 --> 34:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALE: Middlebury helped a lot
because JoyRyde was just an

34:05.210 --> 34:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
idea. And they helped to make it
into a tangible product. SOLMAN:

34:10.982 --> 34:15.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JoyRyde, an app that
incentivizes safe driving, won a

34:15.620 --> 34:19.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business challenge competition
at Middlebury, basically their

34:19.524 --> 34:21.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
version of the show "Shark
Tank." UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It

34:21.760 --> 34:24.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sets a limit to your
interactions with your phone.

After three strikes, the app
knows that you had three strikes

34:27.532 --> 34:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

SOLMAN: There's also a fresh

34:31.236 --> 34:35.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
food delivery service; a
skateboard company, and dozens

34:35.573 --> 34:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more. At Middlebury, even
musicians are now entrepreneurs.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We approach
this very seriously, like you

34:44.950 --> 34:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would a startup. We applied to
Middlebury's mid-challenge

34:48.853 --> 34:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grant, and that gave us the

SOLMAN: All beneficiaries of the

34:59.798 --> 35:04.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

35:04.502 --> 35:08.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no strings attached; no
royalties to the school. We came

35:08.840 --> 35:12.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because we'd heard about
Middlebury and wondered: are the

35:12.077 --> 35:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
liberal arts undergoing an
economic transformation? LAURIE

PATTON, PRESIDENT, MIDDLEBURRY
COLLEGE: I think that the next

35:17.849 --> 35:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stage for everyone around
entrepreneurship and higher

35:20.652 --> 35:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education is to integrate it
better and differently into the

35:25.523 --> 35:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
traditional curriculum. SOLMAN:
New Middlebury president Laurie

35:28.360 --> 35:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Patton, freshly hired from Duke,
which has a major center for

35:32.097 --> 35:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entrepreneurship. But for
Patton, a professor of ancient

35:36.434 --> 35:39.604 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Hinduism, the
entrepreneur-academic connection

35:39.637 --> 35:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't click until she met a
young scholar trying to show the

35:43.274 --> 35:47.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relevance of Indian culture with
Sanskrit greeting cards. PATTON:

35:47.712 --> 35:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What she started was a greeting
card company. And she is really

35:51.716 --> 35:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thriving in this business
because Sanskrit is perfect as a

35:55.754 --> 35:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
language of greeting. SOLMAN:
Entrepreneurship might even be a

35:59.090 --> 36:02.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way of saving a Sanskrit
department somewhere, as

36:02.394 --> 36:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universities yield to economic
pressure and sound the knell for

36:06.164 --> 36:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
liberal arts departments that
don't attract enough students.

36:09.601 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But to Brandeis University
English professor Billy Flesch,

36:13.038 --> 36:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though the economic pressures
are a problem, entrepreneurship

36:16.875 --> 36:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ought not be the answer. BILLY
FLESCH, BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY

36:18.877 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ENGLISH PROFESSOR: I understand
that universities probably have

36:21.012 --> 36:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to become more entrepreneurial.
But I think that if what

36:25.650 --> 36:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universities are selling is a
better life of the mind, that's

36:31.022 --> 36:35.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
great. If what universities are
selling is the idea that you'll

36:35.593 --> 36:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become a better salesman or
woman, that's not so great. I

36:40.131 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that risks corrupting
everything that we do. SOLMAN:

Do you see the emphasis on
entrepreneurship encroaching on

36:47.872 --> 36:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
liberal arts schools like
Middlebury or Brandeis? FLESCH:

36:50.875 --> 36:54.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do. SOLMAN: A liberal liberal
arts school, Middlebury's

36:54.879 --> 36:58.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emphasis is on social
entrepreneurship, businesses

37:04.789 --> 37:06.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day pack and it's made out of
repurposed Coast Guard uniform

-- this is like a backpack?

37:08.793 --> 37:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAVNESS: Yes. SOLMAN: And that
can convert even those who come

37:10.995 --> 37:14.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

languages. CAVNESS: That's why I

37:14.332 --> 37:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
originally wanted to go to
Middlebury, to study foreign

37:16.701 --> 37:20.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
languages. And I never would
have imagined that I would have

37:20.371 --> 37:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thought of an idea to launch a
social enterprise before I

37:23.975 --> 37:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
graduated. SOLMAN: Emily Nunez
Cavness started Sword &amp; Plough

37:27.779 --> 37:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a senior. She was a French
major from a military family. In

37:32.584 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROTC at Middlebury, she served
in the Army in Afghanistan and

37:36.821 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other undisclosed locations as a
Green Beret. CAVNESS: The idea

37:41.926 --> 37:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind Sword &amp; Plough is to work
with veterans to repurpose

37:45.063 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military surplus material that
would otherwise be thrown away

37:48.500 --> 37:51.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and turn it into really
beautiful and functional bags.

37:51.302 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, also to donate 10 percent
of profits back to veteran

also an enthusiast of
entrepreneurship in the college

38:03.248 --> 38:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
environment. CAVNESS: It's
really the perfect incubator to

38:06.918 --> 38:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
launch a business. You're in the
setting where you're supposed to

38:11.556 --> 38:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encourage to learn and think and
dream as much as you can. And

38:14.559 --> 38:17.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then there is also all of these
amazing resources, especially at

38:17.595 --> 38:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Middlebury College that help
you, take that idea and turn it

38:22.133 --> 38:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a successful startup.
SOLMAN: Is the new emphasis on

38:26.671 --> 38:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entrepreneurship in higher
education a function of the lack

38:31.142 --> 38:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of good jobs out there for
graduates? PATTON: I think that

38:33.478 --> 38:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the market right now, makes
students more anxious than it

38:36.447 --> 38:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did 25 years ago, for sure. I
think there is something else

38:40.318 --> 38:43.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening, though students are
not seeing themselves as in one

38:44.022 --> 38:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job forever. I had one recent
grad hand me her card with a

38:49.460 --> 38:53.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
name and a number on it and she
said, "I could tell you what

38:53.298 --> 38:57.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company I am working at, but I
am not going to because we don't

38:57.068 --> 38:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do careers now, we do projects."
SOLMAN: But the obvious

38:59.671 --> 39:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objection is, this is dumbing
down, playing to the lowest

39:02.173 --> 39:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
common denominator. PATTON: Yes,
I think that that is true of a

39:07.512 --> 39:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bad entrepreneurial curriculum.
But a good one, that really

39:11.649 --> 39:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focuses on the rationale for an
innovation, that truly focuses

39:17.188 --> 39:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on creativity, that forces
students to think through,

39:21.893 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly what their plan is for
their new idea. I would say,

39:25.096 --> 39:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's the opposite of dumbing
down. SOLMAN: But Professor

39:27.799 --> 39:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Flesch worries about practical
coaching over intellectual

39:31.502 --> 39:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate. FLESCH: Teaching and
learning come out of conflict

39:35.707 --> 39:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and opposition and trying to
convince the other person that

39:39.444 --> 39:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their idea is wrong in some way
or other. More and more, there's

39:44.315 --> 39:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a sense that what we're supposed
to be doing is empowering

39:47.585 --> 39:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students rather than teaching,
letting them take the ideas that

39:50.955 --> 39:53.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they already have and sell them,
whereas I actually think

39:53.858 --> 39:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teaching is selling new ideas to
students. SOLMAN: OK, so that.

39:56.794 --> 39:59.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, these, the little seeds
are here. Back at Middlebury,

39:59.364 --> 40:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cam MacKugler, selling his new
idea, to us. MACKUGLER: So then,

40:04.168 --> 40:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the customer unfolds this and
places it on top of their soil.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: I think I'm seedpod
challenged. MACKUGLER: Once

40:13.845 --> 40:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
watered, these pods dissolve and
the plants that are embedded

40:17.749 --> 40:21.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within them will sprout and come
up through the openings in the

40:21.386 --> 40:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weed barrier fabric. And you
have the perfectly-arranged

40:24.055 --> 40:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
garden that you've planted in 30
seconds. SOLMAN: And so, in the

40:32.463 --> 40:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

41:46.237 --> 41:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will stand in our way. BROWN: To
see the start of a new trilogy

41:49.440 --> 41:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a series, franchise, a
universe that can seemingly go

41:54.078 --> 41:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on forever. In his article, "The
force will be with us always",

41:58.616 --> 42:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Adam Rogers of "Wired Magazine"
refers to "Star Wars" as an

42:02.687 --> 42:04.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
example of a paracosm. ADAM
ROGERS, ARTICLES EDITOR, WIRED

42:04.689 --> 42:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAGAZINE: A paracosm is in
psychology terms, an imaginary

42:07.091 --> 42:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world. In the case of the "Star
Wars" movie, you can have a year

42:09.360 --> 42:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
zero and go forward and back and
just set stories in the paracosm

42:13.631 --> 42:18.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and people are familiar, oh it
is a "Star Wars" story. These

42:18.302 --> 42:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universes are designed to not
end and not even begin. They can

42:21.773 --> 42:23.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stretch 10,000 in either
direction, "Star Wars"

42:23.775 --> 42:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:
An adventure unlike anything on

42:26.577 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your planet. BROWN: It all back
in 1977. Filmmaker George Lucas

42:30.882 --> 42:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brought out the first "Star
Wars," introducing the world of

42:37.121 --> 42:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia,
Hans Solo and a host of other

42:41.492 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters, human and decidedly
not so. C3PO: I am C-3PO, a

42:46.297 --> 42:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human cyborg relations. BROWN:
Its enormous success as

42:49.600 --> 42:53.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Washington Post" film critic
Ann Hornaday came as a surprise.

42:53.337 --> 42:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN HORNADAY, FILM CRITIC,
WASHINGTON POST: They didn't

42:56.474 --> 42:59.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it would do much. Nobody
thought it would do much. BROWN:

42:59.177 --> 43:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The expectations weren't low.
HORNADAY: Expectations were

43:01.179 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incredibly how but Hollywood, I
think, was so desperate for

43:03.381 --> 43:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something consistent to work
with like a model or template

43:07.819 --> 43:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they thought if they could
just repeat and rebottle that

43:10.488 --> 43:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lightning over and over again,
that they would do it. So, that

43:13.291 --> 43:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is why we have our superhero
comic book franchise culture

43:16.461 --> 43:18.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today. BROWN: The beginning of
the franchise. HORNADAY: Oh,

43:18.696 --> 43:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absolutely. CHARACTER: Here is a
path to the dark side. BROWN:

43:22.733 --> 43:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The second trilogy unfolded
between 1999 and 2005. And now,

43:29.140 --> 43:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the story expands, in a film
directed by JJ Abrams. Speaking

43:33.478 --> 43:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Jimmy Kimmel, the director
explained he was reluctant at

43:36.747 --> 43:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first to take it on. JJ ABRAMS,
FILMMAKER: I was only reluctant

43:40.785 --> 43:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because: A, I love the movie
"Star Wars" so much. I love the

43:42.887 --> 43:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
original trilogy. I was 11 years
old when I saw the first one. It

43:45.490 --> 43:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had a profound impact on me. And
so, the idea of getting so close

43:48.826 --> 43:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to something kind of scared me a
little bit. CHARACTER: I will

43:52.763 --> 43:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show you the dark side. BROWN:
"The Force Awakens " introduces

43:56.501 --> 44:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a new cast. CHARACTER: I don't
know your name. CHARACTER: Finn,

44:00.905 --> 44:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's yours. BROWN: John
Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Oscar

44:04.876 --> 44:09.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Isaac. While tying into the
original trilogy with the

44:09.947 --> 44:13.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presence of its stars.
CHARACTER: If I need this.

44:13.317 --> 44:16.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: It's a purposeful
approach to casting that keeps

44:16.587 --> 44:19.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the story moving in all
directions. ROGERS: Because

44:19.190 --> 44:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
characters can enter and then
leave. In the "Star Wars"

44:23.060 --> 44:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universe, that they are building
right now, characters can die

44:26.831 --> 44:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's OK because that is
what happens in a real universe.

44:31.469 --> 44:33.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then new characters can come
in and you can keep making

44:33.838 --> 44:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
movies about them. BROWN: It's a
story-telling and money-making

44:37.608 --> 44:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power house. Disney bought the
franchise in 2012 for a galactic

44:42.446 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$4 billion. Advance ticket sales
for the new film have already

44:46.918 --> 44:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broken records. And investment
bank Goldman Sachs predicts "The

44:51.022 --> 44:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Force Awakens" will take in some
$8 billion all together. The

44:55.459 --> 44:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
breakdown, about $2 billion in
global box office, and $6

44:59.664 --> 45:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
billion in retail sales, new
games and gadgets, of course.

45:04.602 --> 45:10.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You keep mac
and cheese in here? BROWN: But

45:10.308 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also branded mac 'n cheese.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: "Star Wars"

45:13.711 --> 45:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kraft macaroni and cheese.
BROWN: Data plan deals.

45:17.615 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because when
data, it is your only hope,

45:22.253 --> 45:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better matters. BROWN: "Star
Wars" dodge caravan posessions.

45:26.190 --> 45:28.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going
to need more valets.

45:28.793 --> 45:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can build
the millennium falcon to defeat

45:32.029 --> 45:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them. BROWN: And a whole lot
more, films and merchandising

45:36.000 --> 45:39.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hands in hand. HORNADAY: Part of
this generation's fascination,

45:39.537 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it does have to do with the
merchandising, and the toys and

45:41.706 --> 45:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ubiquity of the projects, and
then there was the Saturday

45:44.108 --> 45:47.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
morning cartoons. I mean, this
universe, these characters and

45:47.745 --> 45:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these narratives have taken all
these different forms and these

45:50.982 --> 45:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different platforms that you and
I might not even be aware of,

45:53.451 --> 45:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it show carried generation
after generation, so that we can

45:55.453 --> 46:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrive at this place and time.
BROWN: A loyal fan base in fact

46:03.094 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lives in this place and time,
inhabiting the "Star Wars"

46:06.964 --> 46:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universe, all across planet
earth. You see it in Japan.

46:11.168 --> 46:15.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello, Tokyo.
BROWN: Australia. UNIDENTIFIED

46:15.206 --> 46:20.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALE: So exciting. We're going
to need your support. BROWN: And

46:20.778 --> 46:24.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mexico. (CHANTING) BROWN: And
millions more of us it seems are

46:24.515 --> 46:27.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ready to go along for the ride
with every any turn. ROGERS:

46:27.752 --> 46:30.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Star Wars" transcends again re
in some ways. It becomes

46:30.755 --> 46:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever we bring to it. It is
western, it's science fiction,

46:33.524 --> 46:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's fantasy, it's philosophy,
it's a family drama. It becomes

46:38.162 --> 46:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a thing that all of us can
connect to on some level. BROWN:

46:42.299 --> 46:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the new film does it live up
to the hoopla? Well, early

46:45.770 --> 46:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reviews including from "The
Washington Post's" Ann Hornaday

46:49.206 --> 46:53.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are strongly positive -- though
I wondered aloud how much that

46:53.144 --> 46:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even matters. This movie sort of
comes presold, right? HORNADAY:

46:56.981 --> 46:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. BROWN: I mean, is it
critic-proof? Does it -- I hate

46:59.417 --> 47:01.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say it, to put it on you, but
does matter what you say to

47:01.686 --> 47:04.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anybody? HORNADAY: Probably not.
And again, going back to how

47:04.422 --> 47:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this changed the movies, that is
another piece. It introduced

47:07.658 --> 47:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that idea to a presold audience
and that is increasingly what

47:11.028 --> 47:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hollywood has wanted over the
last 20, 30 years, is something

47:14.865 --> 47:17.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that comes ready made. They call
it execution dependent. It's not

47:17.702 --> 47:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
execute -- it does matter if the
movie is bad or good but they

47:22.139 --> 47:25.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will come because they are
curious and they're loyal. So,

47:25.543 --> 47:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're probably right that the
critics don't matter, but we'll

47:30.481 --> 47:36.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to make our presence felt
anyway. BROWN: She will have her

47:36.387 --> 47:41.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
work cut out for her. Disney
plans to roll out at least five

47:41.292 --> 47:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more "Star Wars" films over the
next few years. From a galaxy

47:48.399 --> 47:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite near you, I'm Jeffry Brown
for the PBS NEWSHOUR. WOODRUFF:

48:11.889 --> 48:15.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Next, we turn to our weekly
series, "Brief but Spectacular,"

48:15.392 --> 48:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our occasional series where we
ask interesting people to

48:18.629 --> 48:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discuss their passions. Tonight,
we hear from musicians Jack

48:22.433 --> 48:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Conte and Nataly Dawn of the
group Pomplamooose. Their music

48:26.537 --> 48:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is funded directly by fans
through the site patreon.com,

48:30.808 --> 48:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which was co- created by Jack
Conte. Here, they explain the

48:34.044 --> 48:37.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
term "shot-gun creators." JACK
CONTE, POMPLAMOOSE: I think it's

48:37.214 --> 48:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
funny when people say should
music be free? NATALY DAWN,

48:40.184 --> 48:43.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POMPLAMOOSE: Music is free.
CONTE: Music is free. Get over

48:43.687 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. DAWN: Yes. CONTE: Now,
figure out what to do about it.

48:46.123 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One, two, three. DAWN: Covers
are basically free advertising

48:57.668 --> 49:01.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for our original music, and for
our music in general. We usually

49:01.372 --> 49:05.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
re-harmonnize and just sort of
make it our own. (MUSIC) DAWN:

49:05.242 --> 49:10.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It took us awhile to start
making music together. CONTE: We

49:20.558 --> 49:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put out probably four, five
songs and then sort of realized

49:23.994 --> 49:27.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oh my gosh, there is a search
engine and people are searching

49:27.932 --> 49:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for songs like "Single Ladies",
if we cover that, people will

49:36.307 --> 49:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accidentally find our "Single
Ladies"song. (MUSIC) CONTE: The

49:42.546 --> 49:45.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day after we released the video,
Kanye got up with the Grammys

49:45.549 --> 49:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and did his thing. And the next
day, millions of people went on

49:49.720 --> 49:53.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to YouTube and searched Beyonce
"Single Ladies" and they seen

49:53.524 --> 49:56.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nataly's face and click it. We
got about 500,000 views in a

49:56.927 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
24-hour period. If you see
Nataly singing the take, that's

50:00.030 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the actual take that we recorded
in the studio. It's like seeing

50:02.800 --> 50:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the magic trick. You get to see
how sounds are made, because we

50:05.836 --> 50:07.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like to make a lot of weird
sounds and show people how to

50:07.872 --> 50:10.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make them. DAWN: And you also
get to see how lame people look

50:10.541 --> 50:13.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the studio and how not
elegant the whole recording

50:13.410 --> 50:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process is. We make everything
at home. The music we do all of

50:18.015 --> 50:21.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the video editing. We do all of
the instruments. We did a

50:21.685 --> 50:25.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pharrell Williams mashup, the
idea for the video was that

50:25.322 --> 50:29.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basically we would cut out these
big bits of foam core and

50:29.727 --> 50:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
project things on to them and
try to get this natural 3D thing

50:35.032 --> 50:40.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going on with 3D objects. CONTE:
We film the whole thing in one

50:43.941 --> 50:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take with the camera kind of
swooping around. It was an

50:47.945 --> 50:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
iPhone actually. We filmed it
with an iPhone. I like this term

50:50.314 --> 50:55.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"shotgun creator". It's just
sprays everywhere. It's a

50:55.419 --> 50:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
creator who can do the whole
thing. It's a creator who can

50:58.289 --> 51:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
edit and a creator who can write
songs and a creator who can sing

51:01.058 --> 51:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a creator who can build
teams and manage people. And a

51:03.961 --> 51:07.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
creator who can understand
camera gear, and their CEO of

51:07.431 --> 51:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their own media company. And
they run every department. DAWN:

51:12.069 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Nataly Dawn. CONTE: I'm Jack
Conte. DAWN: We are

51:14.204 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pomplamooose. CONTE: This is our
brief but spectacular take.

51:17.141 --> 51:21.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAWN: On shotgun creators.
WOODRUFF: And it was pretty

51:21.312 --> 51:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spectacular. WOODRUFF: So,
finally tonight, our NEWSHOUR

51:24.281 --> 51:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shares -- something that caught
our eye that might be of

51:26.817 --> 51:31.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest to you, too. In 1891,
James Naismith invented the

51:31.522 --> 51:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sport of basketball while he was
a physical education teacher at

51:35.025 --> 51:39.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Springfield College in
Massachusetts. Michael Zogry, an

51:39.296 --> 51:42.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
associate professor of religious
studies at the University of

51:42.333 --> 51:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kansas, recently discovered what
is thought to be the only known

51:46.136 --> 51:51.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recording of Naismith: a 1939
radio interview, in which he

51:51.508 --> 51:55.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recounts telling players to
throw a soccer ball into peach

51:55.446 --> 51:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
baskets he'd nailed up in the
school's gymnasium. Here's an

51:59.016 --> 52:01.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excerpt: INTERVIEWER: And, what
rules did you have for your

52:01.618 --> 52:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first game Dr. Naismith? JAMES
NAISMITH, INVENTOR OF

52:03.620 --> 52:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BASKETBALL: Well, I didn't have
enough, and that's where I made

52:06.023 --> 52:10.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my big mistake. The boys began
tackling, kicking and punching

52:10.194 --> 52:13.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the clinches. They ended up
in a free for all in the middle

52:13.630 --> 52:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the gym floor. Before I could
pull them apart, one boy was

52:17.968 --> 52:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knocked out. Several of them had
black eyes and one of them had a

52:20.871 --> 52:23.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dislocated shoulder. It
certainly was murder. Well,

52:23.774 --> 52:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after that first match, I was
afraid they'd kill each other.

52:27.778 --> 52:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they kept nagging me to let
them play again, so I made up

52:31.715 --> 52:35.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some more rules. The most
important one was there should

52:35.686 --> 52:39.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be no running with the ball.
That stopped tackling and

52:39.256 --> 52:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slugging. We tried out the game
with those rules, and we didn't

52:43.894 --> 52:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have one casualty. We had a fine
clean sport. WOODRUFF: Thank

52:49.066 --> 52:53.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, Mr. Naismith. It all paid
off. On the NEWSHOUR online, why

52:53.303 --> 52:57.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is it so hard to tract potential
terrorists? P.J. Tobia answers

52:57.574 --> 53:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that question with two former
FBI agents who worked in

53:01.045 --> 53:04.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counterterrorism for this week's
episode of his podcast

53:04.548 --> 53:08.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Shortwave". You can find it on
our home page, pbs.org/newshour.

53:08.318 --> 53:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Friday on the NEWSHOUR, join
me on the set of "Downton

53:12.756 --> 53:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Abbey", as the final season of
the drama airs on PBS next

53:18.128 --> 53:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
month. Actor Elizabeth McGovern
plays Cora, the countess of

53:22.132 --> 53:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Grantham, told me why she thinks
the show is so popular:

53:25.402 --> 53:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH MCGOVERN, ACTRESS: I
think there is something

53:27.404 --> 53:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relaxing about this world of
"Downton Abbey". Things were

53:30.474 --> 53:35.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more peaceful, you're not
inundated with text messages and

53:35.079 --> 53:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're just in your house and
life is simpler. WOODRUFF: You

53:38.949 --> 53:42.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got to watch it. And that's the
NEWSHOUR for tonight. I'm Judy

53:42.186 --> 53:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Woodruff. Join us online, and
again here tomorrow evening,

53:45.122 --> 53:48.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks. For all of us at the PBS

53:48.659 --> 53:53.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEWSHOUR, thank you and good
night.
