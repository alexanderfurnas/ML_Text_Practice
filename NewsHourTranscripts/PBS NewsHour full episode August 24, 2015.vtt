A NUMBER OF THINGS.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.633
THINGS. FIRST OF ALL,
THE CHINESE MARKET

09:26.633 --> 09:29.569
FIRST OF ALL, THE CHINESE MARKET
HAS HAD AN MOST UNBELIEVABLE

09:29.569 --> 09:32.138
HAS HAD AN MOST UNBELIEVABLE
YEAR, AND IT'S GONE UP 130% ON

09:32.138 --> 09:35.175

ONE EXCHANGE, 170 ON ANOTHER,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.410
ONE EXCHANGE, 170 ON ANOTHER,
OVER 200% ON ANOTHER, AND SO,

09:37.410 --> 09:38.611
OVER 200% ON ANOTHER, AND SO,
COMMON SENSE, ULTIMATELY, IS

09:38.611 --> 09:44.284
COMMON SENSE, ULTIMATELY, IS
GOING TO PREVAIL, PRICING RATIOS

09:44.284 --> 09:47.220

WHERE IT MIGHT BE 13 TO 16 IN

WHERE IT MIGHT BE 13
TO 16 IN THE U.S.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.424
THE U.S. SO I THINK
THE CHINESE MARKET

09:51.424 --> 09:54.627
SO I THINK THE CHINESE
MARKET WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLY

09:54.627 --> 09:56.095
WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLY
OVERPRICED.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.331
OVERPRICED. SECONDLY,
BAD NUMBERS STARTED

SECONDLY, BAD NUMBERS STARTED
COMING INTO THE CHINESE, EXPORTS

10:00.567 --> 10:03.002
COMING INTO THE CHINESE, EXPORTS
AND IMPORTS DROPPED 8% IN JULY.

10:03.002 --> 10:06.339

BRICKED THE BUBBLE.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.486
