DISCUSS THE REFERENDUM AND ITS

04:40.147 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN

04:41.815 --> 04:42.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNION.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER, WHAT ARE THE

04:43.283 --> 04:45.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRIVING FORCES BEHIND "YES" ON

04:45.018 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REFERENDUM, "LET'S CHANGE

04:46.520 --> 04:47.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT WORKS"?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT'S THE DRIVING FORCES

04:48.455 --> 04:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHIND "NO, LET'S NOT DO THAT"?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE IDEA BEHIND VOTING YES IS

04:53.693 --> 04:54.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE SIMPLE.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION,

04:56.530 --> 04:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ULTIMATELY STREAMLINE THE

04:59.399 --> 05:00.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL SYSTEM HERE.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITALY IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT

05:02.936 --> 05:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GOVERN.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HAD 63 GOVERNMENTS IN THE

05:06.206 --> 05:07.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST 70 YEARS.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THAT

05:09.109 --> 05:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS, IF YOU WANT TO PASS A LAW,

05:11.077 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT TENDS TO GET STUCK BETWEEN

05:12.846 --> 05:15.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH A SENATE AND A HOUSE.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE IDEA WOULD BE TO SHRINK

05:16.216 --> 05:17.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENATE SO YOU MAKE THE HOUSE

05:17.684 --> 05:19.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE MORE POWERFUL, AND YOU

05:19.119 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN GET A LAW THROUGH THAT WAY

05:20.654 --> 05:22.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GENERATE MORE STABILITY IN

05:22.589 --> 05:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, AND WITH

05:23.857 --> 05:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE GOVERNMENTAL STABILITY, THE

05:25.525 --> 05:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDEA IS YOU WOULD HAVE MORE

05:26.793 --> 05:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC STABILITY AS WELL.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE VOTING NO ON THIS ARE

05:31.331 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPSET WITH THE POWERS THIS WOULD

05:33.500 --> 05:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVE TO THE PRIME MINISTER.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONSTITUTION IN ITALY, AS

05:37.938 --> 05:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MENTIONED, CAME AFTER WORLD

05:39.773 --> 05:40.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR II.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO WAS

05:41.608 --> 05:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN CHARGE IN ITALY DURING WORLD

05:43.610 --> 05:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR II AND BEFORE WORLD WAR II.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE

05:46.313 --> 05:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DICTATOR BENITO MUSSOLINI.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN

05:49.749 --> 05:52.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A WAY TO KEEP THE PRIME

05:52.319 --> 05:54.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINISTER FROM BECOMING TOO

05:54.054 --> 05:55.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWERFUL, BUT IN THE PROCESS,

05:55.622 --> 05:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S GENERATED A LOT OF

05:57.023 --> 05:57.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRIDLOCK.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S STILL A LARGE PORTION OF

05:59.392 --> 06:00.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ITALIAN ELECTORATE THAT'S

06:00.794 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL UNDECIDED.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ABOUT 30% OF ITALIANS STILL

06:03.697 --> 06:04.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY THEY'RE

06:04.564 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO VOTE ON THIS THING.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: ONE OF THE THINGS

06:06.566 --> 06:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS

06:07.667 --> 06:09.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION IS THE DOMINO EFFECT IT

06:09.236 --> 06:12.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD HAVE IF REMZI DOES,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDEED, RESIGN, AND THEN THIS

06:14.140 --> 06:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPENS IT UP FOR OTHERS TO TAKE

06:15.475 --> 06:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS PLACE.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, THE FIVE-STAR

06:18.378 --> 06:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVEMENT IS THE ONE WE'RE

06:19.746 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARING A LOT ABOUT.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

06:22.115 --> 06:23.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIVE-STAR MOVEMENT, WHO SUPPORTS

06:23.617 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT, AND WHO ITS LEADER IS.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S A CATCH-ALL PARTY.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TEND TO OPPOSE ANYTHING

06:29.990 --> 06:33.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSES,

06:33.059 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ONE THING THAT WE CAN SAY

06:34.361 --> 06:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY'RE

06:36.096 --> 06:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULIST, THEY'RE

06:37.330 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, AND THEY'RE

06:39.065 --> 06:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTI-EURO.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEADER OF THIS PARTY IS

HE IS SORT OF GLEEFULLY VULGAR

06:49.309 --> 06:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HAS A WAY OF JUST CONNECTING

06:50.977 --> 06:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH PEOPLE, UNLIKE ANY OTHER

06:52.912 --> 06:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIAN ON THE SCENE RIGHT

NOW.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MIGHT RING A BELL WITH

VIEWERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

MEMBERSHIP TO THE EURO ZONE, AND

07:05.892 --> 07:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ECONOMIC SHOCKWAVES ALL ACROSS

ONE EXPECTED RESULT: EXPANDED

IS THERE A SENSE THAT AUSTRIA

>> WELL, YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE

19:28.868 --> 19:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BRITAIN AND

THAT WAS FIRST HELD IN MAY.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN MAY, THE FAR-RIGHT

19:38.411 --> 19:40.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

VERY, VERY CLOSE TO WINNING.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SAY WHICH WAY THIS WAVE IS

19:50.890 --> 19:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMILAR PICTURE TO WHAT WE HAVE

>> I'M NOT SURE IT'S FAIR TO SAY

20:20.853 --> 20:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS IS DRIVEN BY ANTI-E.U.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENTIMENT.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, THE FAR-RIGHT

20:26.125 --> 20:27.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATE, NORBERT HOFER, SAID

20:27.760 --> 20:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUSTRIA COULD HOLD ITS OWN

20:28.928 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE ON LEAVING THE EUROPEAN

20:30.663 --> 20:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNION IN A YEAR AND THAT HASN'T

20:33.232 --> 20:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GONE DOWN TOO WELL IN AUSTRIA,

20:35.534 --> 20:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE MOST PEOPLE, ACCORDING TO

20:37.570 --> 20:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPINION POLLS, FEEL THAT THE

20:39.071 --> 20:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY SHOULD STAY WITHIN THE

20:40.439 --> 20:41.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
E.U.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: IF NORBERT HOFER

20:42.575 --> 20:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD WIN, WHAT COULD HE DO?

20:45.344 --> 20:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT CHANGES COULD HE MAKE?

20:46.645 --> 20:48.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, IN AUSTRIA, THE PRESIDENT

20:48.714 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADITIONALLY PLAYS A LARGELY

20:50.116 --> 20:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CEREMONIAL ROLE.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL POWERS, HOWEVER,

20:53.152 --> 20:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE QUITE BROADLY DEFINED, AND

20:54.620 --> 20:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S POSSIBLE TO INTERPRET THOSE

20:57.156 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A LARGER WAY.

20:59.825 --> 21:00.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S WHAT NORBERT HOFER

21:00.759 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS SAID HE INTENDS TO DO.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD

21:04.497 --> 21:05.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISMISS A GOVERNMENT THAT

21:05.931 --> 21:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHAVED IN A CERTAIN WAY.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S GIVEN A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT LEAST ONE IS IF THE

21:10.970 --> 21:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT WERE TO RAISE TAXES.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER IS IF A GOVERNMENT

21:14.573 --> 21:16.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOWED ANOTHER INFLUX OF

21:16.709 --> 21:17.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGRANTS LIKE THE ONE WE SAW

21:17.910 --> 21:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE JUST OVER A YEAR AGO WHERE,

21:19.478 --> 21:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE TIME, THERE WERE NO I.D.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHECKS, FOR EXAMPLE, OF PEOPLE

21:23.415 --> 21:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING THROUGH, AND HE SAYS IF

21:24.316 --> 21:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE TO

21:25.351 --> 21:26.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN AGAIN, HE WOULD DISMISS

21:26.886 --> 21:27.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOVERNMENT.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
