JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour"
tonight: the Russia file.

00:09.166 --> 00:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. defends a
meeting last year with a Russian
lawyer who promised damaging

00:14.666 --> 00:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
information on Hillary Clinton.

00:16.766 --> 00:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: inside Putin's Russia --
understanding the traditions
shaping the country, part one

00:22.166 --> 00:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of our week-long series.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the Trumpcare battle
from two perspectives.

00:27.733 --> 00:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington, Republicans
continue efforts to repeal
and replace Obamacare.

00:32.366 --> 00:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In rural Virginia,
residents reflect on their
medical needs right now.

00:36.866 --> 00:38.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:38.866 --> 00:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA HILL, Family Nurse
Practitioner: We keep thinking,
well, is it ever going to get

00:40.133 --> 00:41.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better?

00:41.433 --> 00:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is anybody going to help
these forgotten people?

00:43.700 --> 00:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're like something you would
see in a Third World country.

00:46.966 --> 00:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, a rookie
revolution in baseball ahead of
the home run derby and Tuesday's

All Star Game.

00:55.366 --> 01:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:02.233 --> 01:05.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.066 --> 01:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the latest
revelation in the story that's
consumed much of the Trump

01:14.500 --> 01:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidency so far: the Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

01:19.233 --> 01:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this time, it involves
the president's son.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:24.266 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House officials
said today that Donald Trump
Jr.'s meeting last summer

01:30.700 --> 01:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with a Kremlin-connected
Russian lawyer was
just business as usual.

01:35.833 --> 01:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump's
counselor Kellyanne Conway:

01:38.266 --> 01:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump
Senior Adviser: This
was standard operating
procedure for the campaign.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's focus on what didn't
happen in that meeting.

01:43.566 --> 01:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No information provided
that was meaningful.

01:46.066 --> 01:47.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No action taken.

01:47.133 --> 01:49.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

01:49.233 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The New York Times
first reported the June 2016
meeting between Donald Trump

01:55.066 --> 01:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jr., then campaign chairman
Paul Manafort, Trump son-in-law
Jared Kushner, and Natalia

01:59.166 --> 02:01.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Veselnitskaya.

02:01.166 --> 02:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son said he had
been told that Veselnitskaya
had damaging information

02:05.066 --> 02:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Hillary Clinton, who
had clinched the Democratic
nomination just days before.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The meeting came as
some Republicans openly
talked of trying to deny
Mr. Trump their party's

02:16.566 --> 02:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nomination at the convention.

02:18.633 --> 02:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Saturday, Donald Trump Jr.
described the session as a
short introductory meeting in

02:24.500 --> 02:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which U.S. adoptions of Russian
children were discussed.

02:26.966 --> 02:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But yesterday, faced with The
New York Times' reporting on
the purpose of the meeting, he

02:31.466 --> 02:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acknowledged he was told the
lawyer might have information
helpful to the campaign.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "The woman
stated that she had
information that individuals
connected to Russia were

02:43.366 --> 02:46.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
funding the Democratic
National Committee and
supporting Ms. Clinton.

02:46.266 --> 02:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her statements were vague,
ambiguous and made no sense.

02:50.433 --> 02:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It quickly became clear that she
had no meaningful information."

02:54.700 --> 02:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an off-camera White House
briefing, principal Deputy Press
Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders

03:00.633 --> 03:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dismissed the controversy.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
Don Jr. took a very short

03:04.700 --> 03:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting from which there
was absolutely no follow-up.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Don Jr. didn't collude
with anybody to
influence the election.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Donald
Trump Jr. said: "Obviously,
I'm the first person
on a campaign to ever

03:17.466 --> 03:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a meeting to hear
info about an opponent Went
nowhere, but had to listen."

03:23.533 --> 03:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also said he'd cooperate
with the Senate Intelligence
Committee's investigation of

03:26.933 --> 03:29.000 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Russian meddling
in the election.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Moscow, a spokesman for
Russian President Vladimir Putin
said the Kremlin knew nothing

03:33.633 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the lawyer or the meeting.

03:36.233 --> 03:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this comes amid continued
confusion over just what came
out of the president's meeting

03:41.133 --> 03:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Putin last week
at the G20 summit.

03:44.133 --> 03:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration officials
had hailed the creation
of a joint cyber-security
unit to guard against

03:49.866 --> 03:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election hacking.

03:51.466 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Senator Lindsey
Graham called it a dumb idea.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: To forgive and forget
when it comes to Putin regarding

03:57.900 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cyber-attacks is
to empower Putin.

04:00.266 --> 04:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's exactly
what he's doing.

04:02.333 --> 04:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hours after Graham
spoke, the president appeared
to reverse course, saying that a

04:08.066 --> 04:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S.- Russian cyber-security
unit can't happen.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

04:13.133 --> 04:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And John will
be back with a closer look
at the Donald Trump Jr. story

04:17.433 --> 04:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after the news summary.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
head of NATO demanded that
Russia withdraw its troops from

04:24.833 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ukraine.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg addressed
the parliament in Kiev,
and said Europe and

04:29.900 --> 04:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. are united
in support of Ukraine.

04:32.766 --> 04:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General: Russia, and
you know this better than anyone

04:36.033 --> 04:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else, is trying to destabilize
Ukraine through its support
of the militants in the east,

04:43.933 --> 04:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
its cyber-attacks,
disinformation and not
least by the presence
of Russian forces in

04:52.133 --> 04:53.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Ukraine.

04:53.733 --> 04:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This must end.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Officials also
announced that talks will
begin on a plan for Ukraine to

04:59.866 --> 05:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
join NATO by 2020.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new cease-fire in Southwestern
Syria brokered by the U.S. and
Russia appears to be holding

05:08.533 --> 05:10.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for now.

05:10.633 --> 05:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Opposition groups report
relative calm across
three provinces, despite
some sporadic fighting

05:15.700 --> 05:17.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in places.

05:17.733 --> 05:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, a U.N. envoy opened
the latest round of Syrian
peace talks in Geneva today.

05:23.633 --> 05:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq's government has declared
final victory in the battle
to recapture all of the city

05:28.800 --> 05:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Mosul from the
Islamic State group.

05:31.133 --> 05:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. coalition today
welcomed the announcement
and offered congratulations.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.J. Tobia has our report.

05:37.933 --> 05:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The Iraqi national
flag flies in Western Mosul
tonight, after security forces

05:44.333 --> 05:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
began mopping up ISIS
holdouts in the Old City.

05:46.833 --> 05:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
holding their flag upside down
and our flags are fluttering

05:51.600 --> 05:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the riverbank.

05:53.666 --> 05:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
P.J. TOBIA: Prime
Minister Haider al-Abadi
visited Mosul yesterday,
and he returned today,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
formally declaring victory
over the militants known
in Arabic as Da'esh.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister (through translator):
Our victory today is a victory

06:05.633 --> 06:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against darkness, brutality
and terrorism, and from here
we announce to the entire world

06:10.200 --> 06:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end, the failure and the
collapse of the mythical state
and the Da'esh state that was

06:15.200 --> 06:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
announced here in
Mosul three years ago.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: But that victory
has come at great cost.

06:20.666 --> 06:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five months of aerial
bombardments and house-to-house
fighting have left much
of Western Mosul in

06:25.466 --> 06:27.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ruins.

06:27.566 --> 06:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to the local
government, thousands
of civilians have been
killed in the fighting,

06:29.733 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and nearly a million
fled their homes.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's estimated that around
1,000 Iraqi soldiers have
died in the campaign.

06:36.433 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The New York Times'
Rukmini Callimachi was
in Mosul this morning.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says, despite the
claims of victory, there
was still isolated fighting.

06:43.833 --> 06:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI, The New
York Times: I think it's
accurate to say that most of the

06:47.033 --> 06:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city is now under Iraqi control,
but there is definitely a
pocket of resistance here

06:53.466 --> 06:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Western Mosul.

06:54.733 --> 06:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
P.J. TOBIA: And ISIS is
far from a spent force.

06:57.166 --> 07:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It still controls areas across
the Syria-Iraq border, key towns
in Iraq and most of Syria's

07:02.900 --> 07:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Deir el-Zour province.

07:04.933 --> 07:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indeed, in the Syrian city of
Raqqa, the Islamic State's self-
declared capital, the battle

07:11.400 --> 07:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is just beginning, as
U.S.-backed militia
fighters ring the outskirts.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, back in
Mosul, grim work awaits.

07:17.333 --> 07:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: Everywhere
you go in the Old City, if you
catch the wind in the wrong

07:22.133 --> 07:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
direction, you smell
the horrible smell
of decaying bodies.

07:25.900 --> 07:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
P.J. TOBIA: For those
still living in Mosul,
the immediate concern is
digging out and piecing

07:30.500 --> 07:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
together their shattered city.

07:32.466 --> 07:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm P.J. Tobia.

07:35.066 --> 07:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, Congress returned to
work today, and got a warning

07:39.266 --> 07:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from President Trump.

07:41.333 --> 07:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tweet, he said he can't
imagine lawmakers would dare to
take August off without passing

07:46.500 --> 07:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a health care bill.

07:48.566 --> 07:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Republicans remain at
odds over replacing Obamacare,
with no resolution in sight.

07:55.066 --> 07:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number of American adults
without health insurance has
increased by two million this

year.

08:01.766 --> 08:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being
Index reports the uninsured
rate in the second quarter was

08:06.366 --> 08:08.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
11.7 percent.

08:08.166 --> 08:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's up from a record
low of 10.9 reached at
the end of last year.

08:15.133 --> 08:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of people in the
Western U.S. and Canada are
awaiting word to go home after

08:19.666 --> 08:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wildfires chased them away.

08:21.633 --> 08:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One fire in Southern California
has charred more than 45
square miles and burned down

08:27.366 --> 08:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at least 20 buildings.

08:29.433 --> 08:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To the north, in British
Columbia, more than
200 fires burned over
the weekend, and more

08:33.400 --> 08:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than 2,000
firefighters mobilized.

08:37.166 --> 08:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has
again lit into the man
he fired as FBI director.

08:41.266 --> 08:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He accused James Comey of
illegally leaking classified
information, based on a report

08:47.366 --> 08:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cited by FOX News.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, the report
doesn't make that charge.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey has acknowledged letting
a friend leak a memo about a
conversation with the president,

08:59.033 --> 09:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but he says it was
not classified.

09:00.366 --> 09:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Wall Street had an
up-and-down day today.

09:03.700 --> 09:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost five points
to close at 21408.

09:07.466 --> 09:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 23 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added two.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the
"NewsHour": inside Putin's
Russia -- our week-long
series begins by exploring

09:21.066 --> 09:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what drives Russian patriotism;
how the health care battle is
playing out in Virginia's coal

09:26.266 --> 09:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country; and much more.

09:35.333 --> 09:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, for a closer look at the
meeting Donald Trump Jr. and
other Trump campaign officials

09:44.066 --> 09:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
held with a Russian lawyer last
summer, we go back to John Yang.

09:48.333 --> 09:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For more on this,
we're joined by Mark Mazzetti.

09:52.266 --> 09:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's the Washington
investigations editor
for The New York Times.

09:55.500 --> 10:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by John Sipher, he's a
28-year veteran of the CIA
who was based in Moscow in the

10:01.200 --> 10:02.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1990s.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now with the
consulting firm CrossLead.

10:04.133 --> 10:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John, Mark, thanks
both for being with us.

10:06.933 --> 10:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark, let me start with you.

10:08.966 --> 10:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The defense from the White
House, from Donald Trump Jr. is
that nothing came out of this

10:13.333 --> 10:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting, no useful information,
as far as they're concerned.

10:17.900 --> 10:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the broad scope, in
the context of what's going on
now, this investigation into

10:22.466 --> 10:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russian meddling into
the election, what's
the significance that
this meeting even took

10:27.166 --> 10:29.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place?

10:29.133 --> 10:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI, The New York
Times: I think the significance
is that it shows that the

10:31.866 --> 10:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign was at least
open to the idea that Russians
might have had some damaging

10:39.366 --> 10:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information about Hillary
Clinton, and that they
agreed to have this
meeting because -- kind

10:46.166 --> 10:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of on the promise of that.

10:47.833 --> 10:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it was sort of a
hastily arranged meeting
in June of last year.

10:52.033 --> 10:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump Jr., the
president's son, brought in
the campaign chairman and also

10:56.533 --> 11:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Kushner, his son-in-law,
and there was at least a
belief there might be something

11:02.266 --> 11:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quite interesting here.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with all of the
investigations going
on and the swarming
speculation about collusion

11:08.066 --> 11:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with the Russian
government, et cetera,
I think it's interesting
that this is the first

11:11.366 --> 11:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time that we have seen that
the Trump campaign was at least
amenable to this idea of getting

11:16.133 --> 11:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something from Russians that
might be damaging to President
Trump's opponent at the time.

11:19.833 --> 11:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the White House
also said today, Mark, that they
would meet with a lot of people

11:25.700 --> 11:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get opposition research.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But meeting with someone like
this, is this politics as usual?

11:30.600 --> 11:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Well, it's
certainly -- there certainly is
opposition research all the time

11:35.533 --> 11:37.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in campaigns.

11:37.633 --> 11:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the things here
is the sort of evolving story
that has been going on about

11:42.166 --> 11:44.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this meeting.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several months ago, we had
asked Donald Trump Jr. about any
meetings with Russians he may

11:46.833 --> 11:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have had during the campaign.

11:48.900 --> 11:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said absolutely none and
certainly nothing of any
sort of policy dimension.

11:53.466 --> 11:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, on Saturday, we put
the question to him about the
meeting, and the answer was,

12:00.400 --> 12:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, it was primarily a meeting
to discuss adoptions as it
related to the Russian ban

12:05.900 --> 12:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on adoptions after what's called
the Magnitsky Act, which was
passed in the United States,

12:10.400 --> 12:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which the Kremlin
is very angry about.

12:12.500 --> 12:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, Sunday is
the other story, which is the
latest story, which is that,

12:18.533 --> 12:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
OK, they had damaging
information about
Hillary Clinton.

12:20.633 --> 12:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're still trying to get
to the bottom of exactly what
was proposed and why and what

12:26.333 --> 12:27.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
came out of it.

12:27.866 --> 12:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the story certainly
has continued to change.

12:30.633 --> 12:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Mark, what do
we know about this attorney,
Natalia Veselnitskaya, and

12:36.500 --> 12:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how this meeting came about?

12:38.433 --> 12:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: So, she is
a well-connected lawyer in
Russia who has been very active

12:44.533 --> 12:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the United States on the
legal side, but also on the
lobbying side to try to repeal

12:51.633 --> 12:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Magnitsky Act.

12:53.733 --> 12:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so people in Washington --
she knows people in Washington
because she's been active.

12:58.333 --> 13:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And her lobbying and legal
interests are certainly in
line with those of the Kremlin.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is well-connected,
as I said, back in Russia
with family connections.

13:10.400 --> 13:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we now understand that the
meeting was brought up, brokered
by an associate of Donald

13:16.600 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump Jr., a man named
Rob Goldstone, who
is a record producer.

13:20.233 --> 13:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was brokered because
Mr. Goldstone knows -- works
with someone in Russia named

13:28.433 --> 13:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emin Agalarov, who's a pop
star and whose father Donald
Trump, President Trump worked

13:33.033 --> 13:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with in 2013 during the
Miss Universe Pageant.

13:36.066 --> 13:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So there is a sort of
complicated cast of
characters here, but it
involves an associate

13:40.966 --> 13:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Donald Trump Jr., Goldstone,
arranging this meeting with
the lawyer and also these

13:47.366 --> 13:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
connected people back in Russia.

13:49.466 --> 13:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: John Sipher, you
know how these Russians work.

13:51.500 --> 13:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lawyer, a well-connected
lawyer from Russia, and another
connection that goes back, this

13:58.600 --> 14:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pop star's father is a
real estate developer who
has ties to the Kremlin.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are there warning signs?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or how does this work in terms
of how the Russians work?

14:07.266 --> 14:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this fit in with
how the Russians work?

14:09.300 --> 14:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER, Former CIA Officer:
Well, I would look at it as
part of a much larger mission

14:13.633 --> 14:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the Russians
are involved in here.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We realize now there was
a cyber piece to this.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a piece to try to
make Hillary Clinton look bad.

14:21.866 --> 14:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen some reporting
that suggested they tried to
get into voting machines, a

14:25.900 --> 14:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
number of these things.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the thing the Russians
that are focused on most of all
here would be the human aspect.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this lawyer was
clearly tied to the Kremlin.

14:33.466 --> 14:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Magnitsky Act and this
attack by Putin, Bill Browder,
who involved with the death

14:39.900 --> 14:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Mr. Magnitsky, a big deal
to Putin and the Kremlin.

14:43.633 --> 14:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she certainly has
connections to the intelligence
services and to the Russians.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what they would be
doing here, the notion
that she came there to
ask about Hillary Clinton,

14:56.100 --> 14:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the substance of that meeting,
whether it was about adoptions
or not, is less important

14:59.566 --> 15:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the fact that by putting
out what they wanted to talk
about, they were testing the

15:04.233 --> 15:05.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump campaign.

15:05.733 --> 15:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you willing to talk about
things you shouldn't talk about?

15:08.133 --> 15:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When given the choice to make
the right or wrong decision,
are you willing to do that?

15:12.700 --> 15:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As an intelligence officer,
what I want to do with anybody
I'm targeting and looking

15:16.300 --> 15:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at is to see, can I
put them into small
compromising positions?

15:20.133 --> 15:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can I make them make choices
that I think might be the wrong
decision so that next time

15:24.933 --> 15:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I might try something else,
I might try a business
opportunity for you or something

15:28.300 --> 15:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to put you in a position
so I can get more
information from you?

15:31.033 --> 15:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, in other words,
the very fact that they accepted
this meeting, that Donald

15:34.000 --> 15:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump Jr. accepted this
meeting, the Russians
achieved the goal there?

15:37.933 --> 15:39.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Absolutely.

15:39.966 --> 15:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is exactly what they
wanted to do is to see, were
they willing to do this?

15:42.433 --> 15:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if Mr. Trump or Jared Kushner
were sort of ignorant of

15:49.466 --> 15:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
how the Russians work
and stepped into this
without realizing what
they were getting into.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.933 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But Mr. Manafort
certainly knows.

15:54.933 --> 15:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent a career working
in Russia and with bad
actors around the world.

15:58.666 --> 16:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would understand that taking
this meeting would be a signal
to Russians that, hey, we're

16:03.266 --> 16:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
willing to play ball here.

16:05.333 --> 16:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, of course,
Donald Trump Jr. says that he
didn't tell Manafort about the

16:11.566 --> 16:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
substance of the meeting,
he invited him to come, but
didn't tell him the context.

16:13.633 --> 16:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: Well, then what
will be interesting for FBI and
through doing the investigations

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to find out what happened
subsequently, what further
meetings and future meetings

16:23.833 --> 16:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Russians took
place and how they were
orchestrated by the campaign.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: John Sipher,
thank you very much.

16:29.100 --> 16:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Mazzetti from The New
York Times, thank you both
for talking to us about this.

16:34.466 --> 16:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK MAZZETTI: Thank you.

16:44.033 --> 16:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week,
we begin our weeklong series
Inside Putin's Russia.

16:53.066 --> 16:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With support from the
Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting, special
correspondent Nick Schifrin

16:57.700 --> 17:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and producer Zach Fannin
traveled to more than a dozen
cities, conducted 40 interviews,

17:03.433 --> 17:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and were arrested twice.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They will report later
on Russian propaganda,
Russia's opposition,
Russians who join ISIS,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the tense
relationship with the U.S.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the first story explores
a new Russian identity.

17:15.900 --> 17:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a combination of religion,
old Russian traditions, and
rediscovered patriotism.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This new identity helps explain
how people in today's Russia
think, how President Putin

17:27.233 --> 17:29.066 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
acts, and why he
remains popular.

17:29.066 --> 17:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We begin in the southern
city of Krasnodar.

17:33.400 --> 17:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It is
Sunday morning in Russia's
conservative south.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 70 percent of
Russians are Orthodox Christian.

17:44.533 --> 17:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And under President
Vladimir Putin, the church
has been revitalized.

17:48.500 --> 17:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Archpriest Ivan Garmash
is known as Father John.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He tells parishioners
there's only one way
to be a true Christian.

17:56.100 --> 17:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he says being a true
Christian is the only
way to be a true Russian.

17:59.866 --> 18:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATHER JOHN, Archpriest
(through translator): The
state and my faith are united.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They can't be separated.

18:04.966 --> 18:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The values of the church
and the state coincide.

18:08.333 --> 18:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Russia,
faith is patriotic.

18:12.900 --> 18:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Orthodox Church criticizes
liberal Western values as
heresies, while Orthodox priests

18:17.700 --> 18:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bless Russian weapons
and endorse Putin
politically and personally.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president's faith
increases his popularity.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FATHER JOHN (through
translator): He is a
religious man, and he
takes part in the divine

18:27.900 --> 18:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worship with the
people in churches.

18:29.933 --> 18:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president is doing,
what the government is doing, of
course, we support it, because

18:34.666 --> 18:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he acts conscientiously
and truthfully.

18:37.166 --> 18:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today's
reenergized Orthodox
Church helps create pride
in a shared religion.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And historic Russian symbols,
like Cossacks, help create
pride in shared traditions; 500

18:54.533 --> 18:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years ago, Cossacks became
the Russian tsars' henchmen.

18:57.233 --> 19:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were famous and feared
and helped police the
Russian empire's borders.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Soviets persecuted them.

19:05.533 --> 19:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today's Russia restores them.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cossacks fills Krasnodar's
streets at an annual parade.

19:11.666 --> 19:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe Russia should
be governed by tradition,
rather than the rule of law.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR GROMOV, Former Army
Leader (through translator):
Only the nation that has kept

19:19.600 --> 19:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its traditions and
honors them more than
the law deserves respect.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The strength of a nation
is in its traditions.

19:26.900 --> 19:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For 17
years, Vladimir Gromov led
the regional Cossack army.

19:31.833 --> 19:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He revitalized this
event, and helped get the
Cossacks state sponsorship.

19:38.266 --> 19:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Putin awarded him
the Order of Friendship Medal.

19:40.766 --> 19:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gromov considers Putin the
custodian of Russian pride and
stability, preventing the chaos

19:46.433 --> 19:48.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the 1990s.

19:48.833 --> 19:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR GROMOV (through
translator): If it
wasn't for President
Putin, Russia as a state

19:52.600 --> 19:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be struggling through the
toughest times now, and possibly
may have ceased to exist.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only Putin has saved the
state from total collapse.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And, in
return, Cossacks do what
they feel saves Putin.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN (singing): Putin
will teach you to
love the motherland.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: During the 2014
Olympics, the band Pussy Riot
performed a song that disparages

20:11.800 --> 20:14.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

20:14.733 --> 20:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Cossacks unleashed their
centuries-old tradition
of vigilante violence.

20:21.733 --> 20:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, Cossacks doused the
main opposition leader, Alexei
Navalny, and attacked his staff.

20:30.033 --> 20:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Kaliningrad, when a
small group of demonstrators
demanded the government change

20:33.633 --> 20:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its foreign policy, a
Cossack beat up 63-year-old
protester Yevgeniy Greishen.

20:39.833 --> 20:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He lost 80 percent
of his eyesight.

20:42.266 --> 20:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YEVGENIY GREISHEN, Protester
(through translator):
If the regime can't
suppress civil protest

20:44.400 --> 20:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
through legal means,
they punish the people
through affiliated
associations, like the

20:48.966 --> 20:49.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cossacks.

20:49.966 --> 20:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The regime acts through them.

20:51.633 --> 20:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Why
have the authorities
cracked down so much?

20:55.100 --> 20:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YEVGENIY GREISHEN
(through translator): In
Russia, statehood comes
first, and human rights

20:59.233 --> 21:01.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come last.

21:01.300 --> 21:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They use any means to prove the
state is the most important,
more important than a human.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The idea that
the state is more important
than the people is actually

21:09.400 --> 21:10.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not new.

21:10.666 --> 21:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russians have long had
a collective identity.

21:12.166 --> 21:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN, Russia: For us,
the man is collective concept.

21:16.833 --> 21:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We consider ourselves to
be the part of the whole.

21:21.666 --> 21:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to be Russian means
to share the same cultural
and historic identity.

21:29.233 --> 21:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For years,
TV fixture and firebrand
Alexander Dugin inspired
the Kremlin's ideology.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says Russia's collective
identity comes from patriotism,
projection of power, and

21:40.133 --> 21:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
respect for the ruler.

21:42.166 --> 21:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin's tapped into all three,
connecting today's Russia
to its imperial grandeur.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN:
Patriotism is organic.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not artificial.

21:49.233 --> 21:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Empire, or state, is
not something additional
or artificial, because
it is our breath, our

21:56.600 --> 21:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skin, our organic way of life.

21:59.366 --> 22:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today's
Kremlin uses that patriotism
to try and unite the
population and convince

22:04.000 --> 22:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them only a powerful state
can protect them from enemies.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enemy number one?

22:09.466 --> 22:10.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
The U.S.

22:10.966 --> 22:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: America is
on the brink of a revolution.

22:13.433 --> 22:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Dugin and the
Kremlin accuse the U.S. of
humiliating Russia by expanding

22:17.466 --> 22:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO to Russia's borders and
supporting revolutions in former
Soviet states and satellites.

22:24.433 --> 22:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dugin advocates fighting
back by attacking the
West with asymmetric war.

22:26.833 --> 22:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk about introducing
geopolitical disorder,
actively supporting dissident
movements, extremism,

22:32.800 --> 22:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
racist, sectarian groups.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This seems much
more than just...

22:35.700 --> 22:37.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: It's
exactly as you do.

22:37.466 --> 22:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's exactly what you do.

22:38.766 --> 22:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You are supporting
separatist group.

22:40.900 --> 22:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're supporting any kind of
nationalism, including Russian
nationalism that is against

22:44.966 --> 22:46.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

22:46.166 --> 22:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My words are the mirror
what you are doing.

22:50.033 --> 22:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is mirror, and you are
frightened so much because you
are doing the same thing against

22:55.533 --> 22:57.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

22:57.733 --> 23:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Ukraine,
that philosophy was weaponized.

23:05.133 --> 23:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Eastern Ukraine, Russia
aids local separatists
who fight against a
Ukrainian government that's

23:10.133 --> 23:13.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pro-Western.

23:13.300 --> 23:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2014 in Crimea,
Russia helped install
separatist leaders who
rushed through a referendum

23:19.166 --> 23:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that led to Crimea's annexation.

23:25.300 --> 23:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The day of annexation,
Putin gave a speech
combining religion,
patriotism, and imperial

23:28.800 --> 23:30.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

23:30.866 --> 23:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the West had been
subjugating Russia, and Russia
was finally demanding respect.

23:33.666 --> 23:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
If you compress the spring all

23:37.900 --> 23:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way to its limit,
it will snap back hard.

23:40.766 --> 23:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia is an independent,
active participant in
international affairs.

23:44.766 --> 23:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like other countries, it has
its own national interests that
need to be taken into account

23:49.033 --> 23:51.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and respected.

23:51.033 --> 23:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's impossible
to overstate how transformative
Eastern Ukraine and here,

23:59.600 --> 24:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Crimea, have been to
recent Russian memory.

24:02.333 --> 24:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the Crimea annexation,
Putin's popularity spiked
to nearly 90 percent.

24:07.266 --> 24:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russians told pollsters
that suddenly they felt
like a superpower again.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Russians all over
the country mobilized.

24:13.666 --> 24:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Denis Solomin in 2014
fighting in Eastern Ukraine.

24:17.833 --> 24:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a former soldier who
was working a mid-management
retail job when he quit
and crossed the border.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS SOLOMIN, Retired
Soldier (through translator):
Now we hear that behind us.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's an intense battle.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mortars and shells are
raining in our direction.

24:29.666 --> 24:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Solomin
went to war because of that
collective Russian identity.

24:33.933 --> 24:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believed the Ukrainian
government was attacking
ethnic Russians.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DENIS SOLOMIN (through
translator): Those
people who were under
fire, I identified them

24:40.900 --> 24:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Russian people who need
protection by those who
can at least hold a weapon.

24:45.033 --> 24:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What was
it about them that you
felt, I need to help them?

24:49.033 --> 24:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DENIS SOLOMIN (through
translator): Those are
the people with the
same culture as mine,

24:52.066 --> 24:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the same language,
the same world view.

24:53.933 --> 24:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He was convinced
of that by propaganda.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In May 2014, dozens of
pro-Russian separatists
died in Odessa, Ukraine.

25:01.466 --> 25:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS SOLOMIN (through
translator): It probably
became the pivotal moment.

25:05.900 --> 25:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a lot of information
about how people were simply
getting beaten and killed.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russian
media exaggerated the
attack, even using an
actress to play a victim.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know she was an actress
because she appeared in
unrelated pro-Russian
stories as three

25:20.666 --> 25:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entirely different people.

25:22.666 --> 25:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that disinformation campaign
convinces the Kremlin's critics
the new Russian identity

25:27.433 --> 25:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is manufactured and a product
of deception and repression.

25:31.633 --> 25:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, that repression
shows up in masks,
guns and camouflage.

25:36.633 --> 25:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are special forces
surrounding 66-year-old Ilmi
Umerov, in the jacket and jeans.

25:45.033 --> 25:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Umerov is a leader of
the Tatars, a Muslim
minority in Crimea.

25:48.666 --> 25:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He and other Tatars fight
the Russian annexation.

25:51.033 --> 25:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In response, many Tatars have
been jailed on questionable
charges, and Umerov was thrown

25:55.733 --> 25:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into a local insane asylum.

25:58.233 --> 26:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILMI UMEROV, Tatar Leader
(through translator):
So, all this together,
we call one big act

26:01.833 --> 26:03.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of intimidation.

26:03.866 --> 26:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The purpose is to silence some,
and keep others ignorant to
turn them into zombies so they

26:07.100 --> 26:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think the same thing.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are the necessary
conditions in order for
the people to be loyal
to their government.

26:12.066 --> 26:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But do you
acknowledge that that is the
majority of the population who

26:16.266 --> 26:17.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
feels that way?

26:17.466 --> 26:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ILMI UMEROV (through
translator): Of course.

26:19.266 --> 26:20.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Of course.

26:20.933 --> 26:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We can't say that this
is a stupid population
or stupid people.

26:23.266 --> 26:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are just living in
a constellation of fear.

26:25.433 --> 26:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the propaganda machine rolls
over them like a steamroller.

26:28.766 --> 26:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Umerov may
accuse Putin of manipulating
the population, but under Putin,

26:33.733 --> 26:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russia has revitalized
the majority religion,
brought back historic
traditions, and projects

26:41.000 --> 26:43.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

26:43.333 --> 26:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, until there's an
alternative, he's considered
the creator and will
remain the caretaker

26:47.866 --> 26:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the new Russian identity.

26:49.366 --> 26:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin in Krasnodar, Russia.

26:53.600 --> 26:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we continue
our series Inside Putin's
Russia tomorrow, examining

26:59.666 --> 27:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the use of propaganda
by the state.

27:02.266 --> 27:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can hear more from
special correspondent Nick
Schifrin on our Facebook page
at Facebook.com/NewsHour.

27:07.100 --> 27:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:21.200 --> 27:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
minority report, a conversation
on the future of the Democratic

27:26.200 --> 27:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party; its Monday, and our team
is here to analyze the week
ahead in politics; and just

27:33.166 --> 27:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before the All Star Game,
baseball's best rookies are
making themselves heard.

27:39.333 --> 27:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: As Republicans on
Capitol Hill try to repeal and
replace the Affordable Care

27:44.366 --> 27:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act, we're going to spend the
next couple of nights hearing
what patients and health

27:47.966 --> 27:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care providers think
should be done.

27:50.166 --> 27:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our team visited West Virginia
and Virginia, which made very
different decisions about

27:55.766 --> 27:57.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

27:57.366 --> 28:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
West Virginia did commit
to expanding Medicaid
through Obamacare.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Virginia is one of
19 states that didn't.

28:04.200 --> 28:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
The state's
Republican-controlled
legislature voted
against expanding the
program to 400,000

28:10.366 --> 28:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more citizens because
of concerns over costs.

28:12.766 --> 28:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we visit a clinic
providing free care in the
western corner of Virginia, a

28:19.200 --> 28:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
region that strongly supported
the election of President Trump.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:23.466 --> 28:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAULA HILL, Family
Nurse Practitioner: My
name is Dr. Paula Hill.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a family nurse practitioner
and clinical director
here at the Health Wagon.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are at the Smiddy
Clinic in Wise, Virginia.

28:31.766 --> 28:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We actually say that we're
the forgotten Virginia,
because we're down in
the corner with Tennessee

28:36.466 --> 28:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Kentucky borders.

28:38.533 --> 28:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're very rural, very
mountainous and very isolated
from the rest of Virginia and

28:43.966 --> 28:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of ways the
rest of the country.

28:46.100 --> 28:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a high rate of heart
disease, diabetes, and it's
because of the economics here.

28:53.066 --> 28:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL, Virginia:
All the mines and stuff
have just about closed down.

28:58.766 --> 29:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there really isn't
any jobs around here.

29:00.666 --> 29:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Joyce Campbell.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm from Wise, Virginia.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, I get $800 a month.

29:06.600 --> 29:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am fortunate I do
have an income coming in,
with my Social Security.

29:14.100 --> 29:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the time you pay your rent,
your electric, your water, your
gas, you either have a choice

29:21.166 --> 29:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of whether you want to
buy your medicine or
whether you want to eat.

29:24.166 --> 29:26.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA HILL: The Affordable Care
Act, when it was enacted, it
did help a lot of Virginians.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Down here in this part of the
state, in far Southwestern
Virginia, we didn't benefit as

29:36.000 --> 29:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much because there are such
dire economic constraints here.

29:39.433 --> 29:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our patients couldn't afford
the Affordable Care Act.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They couldn't afford $400
a month for a family plan.

29:46.466 --> 29:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Virginia didn't
expand Medicaid.

29:48.966 --> 29:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We actually didn't benefit any.

29:51.033 --> 29:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would have helped if
we had expanded Medicaid.

29:53.566 --> 29:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would have helped
some of our residents
anyway, because there's
a dire amount of poverty.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's people dying every
day, and dying senseless
deaths, because they don't have

30:05.066 --> 30:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
equal right to health care.

30:06.300 --> 30:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA BEAN, Virginia:
My name is Tina Bean.

30:09.566 --> 30:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm 59, and I'm from
Haysi, Virginia.

30:14.533 --> 30:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had congestive
heart failure twice.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't have insurance.

30:18.566 --> 30:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when I started
coming to Paula, or coming
to the Health Wagon.

30:22.266 --> 30:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Without the medicines and stuff,
I probably wouldn't be here.

30:24.466 --> 30:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I heard about the Obamacare
a few years ago and checked
it and stuff, you could tell

30:29.166 --> 30:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then that it wasn't
going to work.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People can't afford it.

30:32.633 --> 30:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: They call
it Affordable Care Act.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it's not.

30:35.766 --> 30:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they said you could
keep your doctors.

30:38.466 --> 30:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You couldn't because your
doctors wouldn't take the thing.

30:42.466 --> 30:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said you could go
to the same hospital, but a
lot of it was built on lies.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you really want to know the
truth, I think - - and I think
somebody one of these days

30:51.733 --> 30:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is going to give
an account for it.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF TILLER, Virginia:
My name is Jeff Tiller.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm 47 years old.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have worked in the
coal mines for 29 years.

31:02.166 --> 31:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They diagnosed me
for black lung.

31:05.400 --> 31:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They done a chest X-ray.

31:10.200 --> 31:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They also have found
some nodules in my lung.

31:17.233 --> 31:18.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA HILL: We are overwhelmed
here at the Health Wagon.

31:20.766 --> 31:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have went to over almost
9,000 patients, and we have
a staff of less than 20.

31:27.066 --> 31:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every year, we have an
outreach clinic event
called Remote Area Medical.

31:32.666 --> 31:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will see them standing
in line for dental care, for
medical care, for vision.

31:37.866 --> 31:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have found people with
dissecting aortic aneurysms
that's had to be flown out.

31:42.533 --> 31:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had patients have stroke
right there in front of us
at these Remote Area Medical

31:46.433 --> 31:48.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

31:48.966 --> 31:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had brain
tumors that have been
discovered, lung cancers
that have been discovered.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And every year, it's like this.

31:53.733 --> 31:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We keep thinking, well, is
it ever going to get better?

31:56.400 --> 31:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is anybody going to help
these forgotten people?

31:59.633 --> 32:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're like something you would
see in a Third World country.

32:02.733 --> 32:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: The Obamacare
could have helped some people.

32:06.333 --> 32:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I say it needs to be replaced.

32:08.166 --> 32:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA BEAN: I hope that
they can replace it.

32:11.033 --> 32:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know it's not going to be
something they can do overnight,
because the mess didn't

32:14.866 --> 32:16.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come overnight.

32:16.866 --> 32:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF TILLER: When I first
started hearing that Obama
getting ready for health care,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obamacare, I thought
that was great.

32:26.166 --> 32:27.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We tried it.

32:27.766 --> 32:29.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We got it.

32:29.333 --> 32:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does it have faults?

32:31.033 --> 32:32.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, it does.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it working?

32:33.600 --> 32:35.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, it is.

32:35.633 --> 32:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know right there in my
hometown of people that's got
insurance through the Affordable

32:40.633 --> 32:41.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

32:41.900 --> 32:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you reverse it, they
lose their insurance.

32:45.733 --> 32:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: If all of this
goes through, I probably
won't have anything.

32:49.233 --> 32:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know how I'm
going to get covered.

32:50.966 --> 32:52.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA HILL: Because of the
preexisting conditions?

32:53.333 --> 32:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, right.

32:54.900 --> 32:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I have had it for years.

32:55.966 --> 32:58.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:58.033 --> 33:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA HILL: If the Senate
plan actually passes, there
will be deep cuts to Medicaid.

33:00.633 --> 33:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though Virginians didn't
expand, what they are paying out
is going to be even -- subjected

33:06.366 --> 33:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to even more cuts.

33:08.400 --> 33:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you have the preventive
care that's being discussed that
they're not going to be paying

33:13.666 --> 33:15.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for anymore.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just because it wasn't a
perfect plan, it doesn't mean
do away with the whole thing.

33:18.866 --> 33:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why can't we build on it and
repair it, not take it away and
then start over with another

33:24.966 --> 33:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan that's not
perfect and not ideal?

33:27.033 --> 33:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: It helped the
insurance company, because they
made all kind of money off of

33:31.600 --> 33:33.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

33:33.566 --> 33:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as far as helping
a lot of poor people, it
didn't, and it still isn't.

33:36.633 --> 33:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, we cannot afford the high
cost like Obama had there.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's no way that
people in Southwest
Virginia can handle it.

33:45.833 --> 33:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, maybe up Washington,
or way up where there's
money and jobs, you could.

33:52.033 --> 33:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there's neither
money nor jobs here.

33:53.933 --> 33:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA BEAN: They need to
do something to help it.

33:56.900 --> 34:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, hopefully, the
administration now, maybe
they will do something.

34:00.233 --> 34:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: Washington,
come to Southwest Virginia.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA HILL: Come down here
and look in their eyes.

34:06.033 --> 34:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And don't forget
where you came from.

34:08.866 --> 34:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't forget who put you in
the position that you're in.

34:11.633 --> 34:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOYCE CAMPBELL:
Check the people.

34:13.366 --> 34:14.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at them.

34:14.366 --> 34:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Go sit on the streets.

34:16.066 --> 34:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Go bring your car and
park it and look at the
people that are hurting.

34:19.566 --> 34:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then, if you have
got a heart, you will
know what it needs.

34:26.566 --> 34:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we
begin the first in a series of
conversations focusing on the

34:39.400 --> 34:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future of the Democratic
Party, now out of power in the
House, in the Senate, and the

34:45.000 --> 34:47.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

34:47.100 --> 34:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us now, the co-chair
of the House Democratic Policy
and Communications Committee.

34:50.233 --> 34:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is Congresswoman
Cheri Bustos of Illinois.

34:52.900 --> 34:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the only member of the
House Democratic leadership
team from the Midwest.

34:57.066 --> 34:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Representative Bustos,
welcome to the program.

34:59.066 --> 35:00.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS (D),
Illinois: Thank you, Judy.

35:02.566 --> 35:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
before we talk about the
party, the Democratic
Party, let me just ask

35:04.666 --> 35:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, having watched and listened
to that report from Virginia,
such conflicting opinions about

35:08.766 --> 35:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

35:10.866 --> 35:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can you know the Democratic
Party's position is right, when
people are so conflicted over

35:16.100 --> 35:17.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

35:17.100 --> 35:18.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well, I don't
know if we're entirely right.

35:20.700 --> 35:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the way we need to look
at the Affordable Care Act is,
while it's made some tremendous

35:23.533 --> 35:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improvement in people's
lives, there is a lot of
work we need to do still.

35:30.433 --> 35:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prescription drug prices are
too high and unaffordable
for too many people.

35:33.300 --> 35:37.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Co-pays, deductibles and
premiums are too high
for too many people.

35:37.433 --> 35:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the folks who were
just talking on the
show demonstrate that.

35:41.633 --> 35:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, what resonated the
most with me was right at the
end of the story, when you

35:45.233 --> 35:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had people saying, come
here, look us in the eye,
talk to us, listen to us.

35:50.166 --> 35:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is everything to
do with what we need to do
as Democrats going forward.

35:57.233 --> 36:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we ever want to win back
the majority in 2018, that's
exactly what we need to do.

36:01.533 --> 36:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
let's talk about that.

36:03.566 --> 36:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You represent your district,
the 17th District of Illinois,
northwestern part of the state.

36:06.566 --> 36:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You won by, what, 20 points
last fall reelection.

36:10.633 --> 36:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump also won
by, what, just a fraction
of a point, but he won.

36:17.033 --> 36:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was it in his message
that appealed to your voters?

36:18.833 --> 36:20.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well, we have
communities all over the Central
and Northwestern Illinois,

36:23.533 --> 36:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the area that I represent,
that have lost their
jobs to outsourcing.

36:27.400 --> 36:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ag and manufacturing are
the two economic drivers in
my congressional district.

36:34.300 --> 36:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when you have people
who lost their jobs -- one
example was the Maytag plant in

36:38.766 --> 36:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Galesburg, Illinois.

36:40.733 --> 36:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was 13 years ago this
September when Maytag sent every
one of their last jobs over to

36:44.600 --> 36:46.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mexico.

36:46.533 --> 36:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, all these years
later, the people who had these
jobs still haven't recovered

36:50.000 --> 36:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the wages to the same
level they did before.

36:52.500 --> 36:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to the people who
then took another job who then
ended up being outsourced and

36:59.500 --> 37:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now are working, for instance,
as a clerk in a grocery store
making half what they did

37:01.566 --> 37:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a dozen years ago.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's what resonated.

37:04.900 --> 37:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people can hearken back
to making America great again,
that resonated with people who

37:11.400 --> 37:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have lost their jobs
and who aren't making
what they did before.

37:13.433 --> 37:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you have
been saying it's not enough for
Democrats to be against Donald

37:16.866 --> 37:18.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

37:18.933 --> 37:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's clear Democrats disagree
with him on health care, on
the Russia story, and on and

37:22.800 --> 37:24.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it that Democrats
should be saying?

37:25.033 --> 37:27.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:27.066 --> 37:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: I think we
should be talking nonstop
about jobs and the economy.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have the right policies.

37:31.500 --> 37:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a whole
make-it-in-America package
that focuses on making
products in America.

37:36.466 --> 37:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have job retraining programs.

37:39.233 --> 37:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have the right -- we
have the right programs,
but we talk about things
that are more divisive

37:45.100 --> 37:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than they draw us together.

37:47.166 --> 37:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think if we talk about our
values and what we stand for
as Democrats, making sure that

37:51.500 --> 37:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hardworking men and women have
a chance to succeed -- when I
go home and listen to people,

37:58.100 --> 37:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's what they want us
to focus on, not things
that divide people.

37:59.766 --> 38:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is
there a single message?

38:02.133 --> 38:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it a combination of messages,
a vision that the Democratic
Party has that's not being

38:07.600 --> 38:08.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spoken?

38:08.366 --> 38:10.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

38:10.466 --> 38:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well,
what we're doing, kind
of a behind-the-scenes
look at it, we are

38:12.100 --> 38:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working with the
Senate, the House.

38:14.166 --> 38:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're also making sure that
the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee is informed

38:17.733 --> 38:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what we're doing,
the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm told that this is the
first time where we have really
all worked together on this.

38:28.533 --> 38:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my role in policy
communications, we have
met with more than 150 of
our Democratic colleagues.

38:31.066 --> 38:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have met with all the major
caucuses, from the Congressional
Black Caucus, the Progressives,

38:35.533 --> 38:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Blue Dogs, the New Dems.

38:37.466 --> 38:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is a very much
bottoms-up report, our
coalescence of ideas.

38:44.066 --> 38:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But what we will do is,
this will all be about
jobs and the economy.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will roll this
out this month.

38:48.966 --> 38:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then when all these members,
congressional members, go back
home for the August district

38:52.633 --> 38:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work period, we they be talking
about jobs and economy, and
we will be united on that.

38:56.300 --> 39:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that's a
little bit about the process,
but in terms of the vision, what

39:00.433 --> 39:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the vision of the
party for the country?

39:03.233 --> 39:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you say jobs and the
economy -- and I want to bring
in or mention something else

39:08.100 --> 39:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have been saying, is
you have said to your fellow
Democrats, don't talk down to

39:11.966 --> 39:13.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Make sure they know
you respect them.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the message there?

39:16.433 --> 39:18.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well, the
message is, is that we may
be members of Congress.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It just means that we
have a different job.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're no better, no
worse than anybody else.

39:25.900 --> 39:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just a different job.

39:28.166 --> 39:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm blessed by the fact that I
was a newspaper reporter, and
I have been in the homes in

39:35.066 --> 39:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the worst neighborhoods,
the toughest neighborhoods
of my region, to, you know,

39:38.333 --> 39:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the country club lot in life.

39:41.800 --> 39:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I'm comfortable talking
to any of those people.

39:45.833 --> 39:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm also -- I know
that I'm no better or no
worse than any of them.

39:49.333 --> 39:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But back to your question
about what is it about jobs and
the economy, that we're going

39:54.033 --> 39:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to make sure that Social
Security is strong and
will grow stronger.

39:58.066 --> 39:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we're not going
to cut benefits.

39:59.633 --> 40:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's not something
we stand for.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I gave my mom a call today
and she said, what are they
doing to my health care?

40:05.833 --> 40:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's 84 years old.

40:07.866 --> 40:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to make sure that
Medicare is strong and is not
facing financial difficulty.

40:14.133 --> 40:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to make sure that
pensions people that they have
paid into are not sacrificed.

40:17.166 --> 40:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got all the right
policies, but we have
got to talk about that.

40:20.600 --> 40:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So is it a matter
of not changing or cutting
back on government programs?

40:24.733 --> 40:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that the Democrats' idea?

40:26.066 --> 40:28.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: I don't think
government is the entire
answer, but people want to know

40:30.300 --> 40:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that their member of Congress
is going to Washington and
fighting for them, that we

40:34.200 --> 40:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't view that everybody
through the lens that it's all
partisan and we can't work with

40:38.633 --> 40:40.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

40:40.733 --> 40:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I know the people of my
congressional district
send me to Washington
and expect me to get

40:43.800 --> 40:45.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a job done.

40:45.866 --> 40:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want me to work hard,
because I make a pretty good
wage, especially in comparison

40:47.766 --> 40:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a lot of families.

40:49.333 --> 40:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want me to fight for them
if there's a fight to be had.

40:51.433 --> 40:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they want me to get results.

40:53.533 --> 40:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that's so
much different, whether you're
in San Francisco or New York

40:56.133 --> 40:57.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
City or Chicago.

40:57.833 --> 40:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's what people want
in their members of Congress.

40:59.900 --> 41:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what,
frankly, they deserve.

41:02.033 --> 41:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally,
who is the leader of the
Democratic Party right now?

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Who is the leader?

41:06.866 --> 41:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, I suppose it depends
on how you look at it.

41:10.166 --> 41:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On the House side,
it's Nancy Pelosi.

41:11.733 --> 41:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On the Senate side,
it's Chuck Schumer.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At the DCCC, at the DCCC...

41:15.066 --> 41:16.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:16.233 --> 41:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
congressional committee.

41:17.066 --> 41:18.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:18.066 --> 41:19.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHERI BUSTOS: Yes, the
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

41:21.233 --> 41:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it's Tom Perez at the
Democratic National Committee.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
it's a group of people?

41:23.033 --> 41:24.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHERI BUSTOS: Yes,
it's a group of people.

41:26.300 --> 41:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we also have a lot
of young emerging leaders who,
in time, will take different

41:30.500 --> 41:31.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
roles.

41:31.966 --> 41:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm proud of the fact that I
sit at the leadership table now.

41:35.300 --> 41:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The fact that I'm the
only Midwesterner, I
would like a little more
company sitting around

41:38.633 --> 41:40.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the table.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're practical in the
Midwest, and I would like to
see a little more of us sitting

41:43.633 --> 41:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the leadership table.

41:45.733 --> 41:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, you
were just named by the Campaign
Committee the Democratic -- the

41:47.533 --> 41:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chairwoman of the Heartland
Engagement Committee.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congresswoman Cheri Bustos,
thank you very much.

41:54.166 --> 41:55.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:55.166 --> 41:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Thank you, Judy.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We appreciate it.

42:02.666 --> 42:03.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

42:03.666 --> 42:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHERI BUSTOS: Thank you.

42:06.500 --> 42:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now it's time
for Politics Monday with Amy
Walter of The Cook Political

42:12.366 --> 42:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR.

42:14.333 --> 42:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Amy, Tam, you have
just been hearing what
Congresswoman Bustos has said.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In fact, she's still
here at the table.

42:20.366 --> 42:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, Amy, what do
you make of that?

42:22.400 --> 42:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you hearing from the
Democrats where they want
to take this country?

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well, I will say this.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every party that's the out party
always struggles with this.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who are we now that
we're not in charge?

42:34.800 --> 42:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in this case, Democrats
are not only the out party.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't control anything.

42:37.766 --> 42:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just the White House.

42:39.266 --> 42:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have the House or
the Senate or the White House.

42:41.833 --> 42:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is -- and every
election is a referendum
on the party in power.

42:46.033 --> 42:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Republicans are
the party in power.

42:48.066 --> 42:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 2018 election is going to
be a referendum on whether they
were able to accomplish what

42:51.833 --> 42:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they said they were
going to do or not.

42:54.266 --> 42:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's Democrats' job getting,
I think, as we get into 2020
and the battle is for who is

42:59.233 --> 43:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to occupy the White
House to have that message that
their standard bearer -- you

43:03.533 --> 43:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ask the question, who is
the leader of your party?

43:05.633 --> 43:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leader of their party is
going to be the person that they
nominate in 2020 to be their

43:09.700 --> 43:11.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nominee.

43:11.133 --> 43:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's
several years away.

43:12.933 --> 43:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER:
®MD+IMD-IIt's very
®MD+IMD-Imany years away.

43:15.066 --> 43:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Remember, Republicans
were successful in the
midterm elections in
2010, Democrats were

43:17.500 --> 43:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful in the
midterm elections in
2006 in taking control
of Congress away from the

43:23.200 --> 43:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposite party, not because
they were unified with a message
about who they were or what

43:26.333 --> 43:27.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they stood for.

43:27.566 --> 43:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They stood against
the party in power.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was a referendum
on that party.

43:31.933 --> 43:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Voters were not happy
with the party in power.

43:34.900 --> 43:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the out party benefited.

43:36.900 --> 43:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is plenty of time
for Democrats to figure out
who they are, but they are,

43:42.900 --> 43:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just like Republicans,
very divided ideologically.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, from
your reporting on the Hill,
your reporting from the White

43:49.233 --> 43:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House, do the Democrats feel
like a force that's together,
that's found their voice

43:53.300 --> 43:55.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now?

43:55.366 --> 43:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: They have certainly found
a way to oppose the Republican

43:57.566 --> 43:58.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legislation.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They not splintered
when it comes to votes.

44:01.333 --> 44:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of that is credit to
Nancy Pelosi's ability to whip
votes, which she has honed

44:08.166 --> 44:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over many years in leadership,
and also Chuck Schumer
has kept them together.

44:10.933 --> 44:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There haven't been the
defections that -- particularly
in the Senate, that
President Trump had hoped

44:16.533 --> 44:19.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he would get.

44:19.066 --> 44:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had brought some of
these moderate Republicans
in red states who were
up for reelection over

44:23.500 --> 44:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the White House.

44:24.733 --> 44:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He had sort of tried
maybe to woo them.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It didn't work.

44:28.900 --> 44:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have not been in
any way forced to have
a wedge between them and
the rest of the Democratic

44:33.833 --> 44:35.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

44:35.866 --> 44:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which has been
-- so far, Amy, has contributed
to the fact that Republicans

44:38.100 --> 44:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are still struggling to get
an answer on health care.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ®MD+IMD-IRight.

44:42.800 --> 44:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this goes to the challenge,
Judy, which is, when you're a
party that has been successful,

44:48.666 --> 44:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Republicans were successful
in the last few years, by
being basically the party of

44:51.800 --> 44:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, right, they were against
everything that Democrats and
President Obama stood for, that

44:58.800 --> 45:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was successful to get them a
governing -- or a political
majority, but not a governing

45:01.966 --> 45:03.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

45:03.966 --> 45:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So now that they're in
power, they're struggling
with, what do you do?

45:06.500 --> 45:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have multiple
factions in the Republican
Party, just as Democrats
have multiple factions.

45:10.233 --> 45:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trying to get them all together
to agree on something like
a health care bill, which is

45:14.033 --> 45:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
super complicated, is a
lot harder than getting
them all to agree that
Obamacare is terrible.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, you
have been out on the road.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were following Bernie
Sanders in the last
couple of days, who has
been holding rallies,

45:23.800 --> 45:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trying to say what
the Republicans are
doing is all wrong.

45:26.833 --> 45:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you seeing?

45:27.833 --> 45:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you feeling?

45:29.933 --> 45:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD+IMD-ITAMARA KEITH: So,
one interesting thing about that
is that Bernie Sanders wants

45:31.333 --> 45:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Medicare for all,
single-payer health care.

45:34.666 --> 45:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he didn't make a big
thing out of it at this rally.

45:37.800 --> 45:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the focus at this
rally that I went to in West
-- or in Kentucky was about the

45:44.733 --> 45:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican bill and what
it would mean for people.

45:47.666 --> 45:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sanders' message was
really that the Affordable
Care Act, Obamacare,
needs to be fixed, which

45:55.366 --> 45:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is actually standing
for something.

45:58.033 --> 46:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like -- it's not just no.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's yes.

46:01.800 --> 46:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, it's not clear
that Democrats can agree
on what the fix is.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's more people who
are quietly saying, well, maybe
single-payer, maybe Medicare for

46:10.566 --> 46:12.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

46:12.133 --> 46:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But that -- and that
is a longstanding
divide among Democrats.

46:15.366 --> 46:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
Democrats can be unified,
at least around that.

46:18.733 --> 46:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ®MD+IMD-IAt
least around that.

46:19.966 --> 46:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think Tam
is exactly right.

46:22.033 --> 46:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's going to be the
bigger challenge in
2020, as the Democrats
try to figure out their

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
messaging on, do we go further
to the left, talk about
single-payer, Medicare for all,

46:31.633 --> 46:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or do we just say, well,
try to fix what isn't
working in health care?

46:35.266 --> 46:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, I think, is going
to be a big dividing line
in the Democratic primary.

46:38.533 --> 46:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, can't let
you go without a quick question
about our lead tonight, Tam.

46:42.266 --> 46:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the new revelations
about the Trump campaign and
Russia, Donald Trump Jr. meeting

46:48.433 --> 46:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Russian
lawyer and so on.

46:49.666 --> 46:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have been doing
a lot of reporting.

46:51.733 --> 46:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this more of the same, or
have we turned some kind of
an important corner with this

46:54.900 --> 46:56.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information?

46:56.400 --> 47:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think it's hard
to know where the corners are.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a new person.

47:02.400 --> 47:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is Donald Trump Jr., who
is now a person that is involved
in this whose name is out

47:07.700 --> 47:09.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

47:09.766 --> 47:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a remarkable thing
about this is that he
basically confirmed much
of it on the record,

47:14.733 --> 47:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a pretty
remarkable thing.

47:16.866 --> 47:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He confirmed that he arranged
a meeting with top campaign
officials with a Kremlin-linked

47:23.933 --> 47:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lawyer because she was
potentially offering
damaging information
about Hillary Clinton.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's something.

47:29.700 --> 47:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not necessarily collusion.

47:31.833 --> 47:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And collusion isn't necessarily
a violation of the law.

47:35.633 --> 47:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But in this sort of
ongoing drip, drip,
drip, was a bigger drip.

47:39.633 --> 47:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ®MD+IMD-IYes.

47:41.633 --> 47:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it also goes back to
something I feel like we
talk about every time, Judy.

47:43.633 --> 47:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Theoretically, what we should
be talking about today is
simply about health care.

47:49.833 --> 47:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was supposed to be how
we were set up this week.

47:51.300 --> 47:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a big week to
get something through.

47:53.366 --> 47:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president should be
focusing all of his energy
and attention on doing that.

47:57.933 --> 48:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, now we're talking
once again about Russia.

48:00.633 --> 48:03.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The other thing that
is consistent, these
are all self-inflicted.

48:03.466 --> 48:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not something that the
committees brought up or that
Robert Mueller, the special

48:07.266 --> 48:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prosecutor, has brought up.

48:09.333 --> 48:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is coming from the lack
of transparency from people
either during the campaign or

48:15.633 --> 48:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during the transition about
their connections to Russia.

48:18.233 --> 48:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because they had
filled out forms that didn't
include this latest information.

48:21.366 --> 48:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER:
®MD+IMD-ICorrect.

48:22.366 --> 48:23.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Correct.

48:23.833 --> 48:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when this
information comes out...

48:24.500 --> 48:26.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:26.533 --> 48:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ®MD+IMD-INow
it looks like they have to
correct, and then it looks

48:27.966 --> 48:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like they're hiding something,
whether they are or not.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just imagine, in another world,
had they come from the very
beginning and been completely

48:32.666 --> 48:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transparent, even
overtransparent, right?

48:35.533 --> 48:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anybody that I met that even has
a Russian-sounding last name,
I'm going to put their name on

48:39.200 --> 48:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a piece of paper and I'm going
to give it to you, so you
can never say that I'm trying

48:44.066 --> 48:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hide anything.

48:45.266 --> 48:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
that hasn't happened.

48:46.700 --> 48:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ®MD+IMD-IBut
that hasn't happened.

48:48.733 --> 48:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: No, and it's a
direct contradiction of things
that they have said publicly and

48:49.400 --> 48:51.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the record.

48:51.366 --> 48:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara
Keith, Amy Walter, Politics
Monday, thank you both.

48:53.633 --> 48:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: ®MD+IMD-IYou're
welcome, Judy.

48:59.500 --> 49:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

49:03.433 --> 49:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Professional
baseball has reached
the midpoint of its
season, and it's turning

49:09.533 --> 49:12.100 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
out to be a most
compelling year.

49:12.100 --> 49:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of the game's best players
are in Miami for the next couple
of nights for the midsummer

49:16.866 --> 49:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
classic, the All-Star Game.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Things kick off tonight
with the Home Run Derby.

49:22.100 --> 49:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown takes
it from there.

49:23.633 --> 49:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
at bat, another home run.

49:26.600 --> 49:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Balls are flying out of the
park this year at a record pace.

49:29.900 --> 49:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And adding to the excitement,
two of the biggest sluggers are
rookies Aaron Judge of the New

49:36.300 --> 49:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York Yankees and Cody Bellinger
of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

49:39.366 --> 49:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Verducci is an MLB Network
analyst, a senior writer for
"Sports Illustrated," and,

49:43.933 --> 49:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tomorrow, he will be the
FOX MLB reporter for the
All-Star Game in Miami.

49:48.733 --> 49:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He joins us from Marlins
Park, the site of the
all-star festivities.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tom, welcome to you.

49:54.800 --> 49:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first of all, all those
home runs, I have seen different
theories, the changes to the

49:59.933 --> 50:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
balls, changes to the swing.

50:01.566 --> 50:03.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

50:03.566 --> 50:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM VERDUCCI, "Sports
Illustrated": Well, a
little bit of everything.

50:04.366 --> 50:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like baking a cake.

50:05.466 --> 50:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just one ingredient.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are many ingredients.

50:08.966 --> 50:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you talk to the pitchers,
they will definitely talk about
the difference in the baseball,

50:12.733 --> 50:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the baseball actually is
wound tighter and the seams
on the baseball are smaller.

50:16.300 --> 50:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So if you have lower
seams, you have less drag.

50:23.233 --> 50:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have less drag, of
course, that means more carry,
and more fly balls are carrying

50:27.166 --> 50:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of ballparks.

50:28.166 --> 50:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you did bring up something.

50:30.133 --> 50:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hitters now know that to
make money in the baseball,
you have to do damage.

50:36.733 --> 50:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have to hit the
ball in the air.

50:41.233 --> 50:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this generation hitters
is all about launching
the ball in the air and
not necessarily hitting

50:45.900 --> 50:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it on the ground
for batting average.

50:47.133 --> 50:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It more about in
the air or slugging.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, speaking of
this generation, we have these
two new rookie stars, and they

50:51.633 --> 50:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happen to be in very
large markets, right,
New York and L.A.

50:54.700 --> 50:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what kind of impact
are they having this year?

50:57.266 --> 51:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VERDUCCI: Yes, it's
the perfect storm for
baseball, because it
truly is the intersection

51:00.833 --> 51:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the two dominant
trends in baseball, number
one, the home runs we
talked about, and, number

51:06.933 --> 51:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two, the influx of
young stars in the game.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, baseball, traditionally,
there has been a
long learning curve.

51:10.733 --> 51:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even when they get to
the Major Leagues, after
their apprenticeship
in the minor leagues,

51:16.600 --> 51:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it takes a while for a
player to establish himself.

51:19.466 --> 51:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we're seeing now in
recent years -- and Judge and
Bellinger are great examples of

51:26.433 --> 51:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this -- hitters becoming impact
players almost immediately as
soon as they get to the big

51:29.966 --> 51:31.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leagues.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, I think this has
something to do with
our society in general.

51:33.200 --> 51:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're now specializing
at early ages.

51:36.233 --> 51:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, these hitters now
are specializing on the
art of hitting, rather
than playing multiple

51:39.266 --> 51:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sports, locking in on
their specific skills.

51:40.733 --> 51:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Judge and Bellinger
have hit the ground running.

51:44.900 --> 51:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And one more thing.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bellinger, in A Ball a couple
of years ago, specifically
changed his swing to hit more

51:56.933 --> 51:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
balls in the air.

51:58.900 --> 52:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, he's
adapted to this revolution
of fly ball hitters.

52:01.500 --> 52:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's paying off for him.

52:04.033 --> 52:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We have
this sort of overperforming
team in the Houston Astros
and the underperforming,

52:10.233 --> 52:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the reigning
champions, the Cubs.

52:12.233 --> 52:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But do want to ask you in
our last minute about this
continuing problem, the length

52:16.300 --> 52:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the games, something I notice
and probably a lot of the fans.

52:19.866 --> 52:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is it so hard
to change that?

52:21.933 --> 52:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM VERDUCCI: Sure.

52:24.033 --> 52:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, first of all, it's not
so much about length of game
as it is about the pace of

52:26.500 --> 52:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the action, how quickly
or not, as it is, is
the ball put in play.

52:31.266 --> 52:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's all the time
between pitches.

52:33.300 --> 52:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it is a
priority for Major League
Baseball going forward.

52:37.500 --> 52:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The game is strong right
now economically, but
I think baseball is
worried about a younger

52:41.500 --> 52:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generation of fans who get
turned off by the amount
of downtime in the game.

52:48.233 --> 52:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In soccer, football, basketball,
the ball is generally
in motion quite often.

52:51.366 --> 52:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In baseball, it's going
in the opposite direction.

52:54.033 --> 52:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, baseball now is talking
about some remedies,
talking about, now,
including perhaps a pitch

53:01.066 --> 53:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clock, where a pitcher now would
be literally under a clock to
deliver his next pitch, say,

53:05.466 --> 53:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within 20 seconds.

53:06.700 --> 53:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have tried that
in the minor leagues.

53:08.766 --> 53:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It definitely has worked
in transportation of moving
the game at a better place.

53:12.033 --> 53:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now baseball needs the
Players Association to agree
to that kind of change.

53:16.666 --> 53:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As they say,
negotiations are ongoing.

53:19.233 --> 53:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
