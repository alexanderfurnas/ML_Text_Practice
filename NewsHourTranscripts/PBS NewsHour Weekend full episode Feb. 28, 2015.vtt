DEADLINE VOTE KEEPS HOMELAND

00:15.249 --> 00:16.750
SECURITY FUNDED FOR ONE MORE

00:16.750 --> 00:18.685
WEEK; THE LATEST FROM MOSCOW

00:18.685 --> 00:19.953
FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF A

00:19.953 --> 00:21.188
LEADING RUSSIAN OPPOSITION

00:21.188 --> 00:23.190
LEADER; AND IN OUR SIGNATURE

00:23.190 --> 00:24.825
SEGMENT, ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR

00:24.825 --> 00:26.860
YOUTH SPORTS IN AMERICA NOW

00:26.860 --> 00:28.428
FACING SCRUTINY OVER THE RISK OF

00:28.428 --> 00:29.329
CONCUSSIONS.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.331
>> DO WE WANT TO, IN THE NAME OF

00:31.331 --> 00:33.200
SPORT, PUT A CHILD'S BRAIN IN

00:33.200 --> 00:34.101
HARM'S WAY?

00:34.101 --> 00:35.135
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:35.135 --> 00:36.570
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.340
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS OF

00:40.340 --> 00:41.808
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:41.808 --> 00:43.443
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.144
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.078
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.613
CONGRESS MANAGED TO AVOID A

00:46.613 --> 00:47.781
PARTIAL SHUTDOWN OF THE

00:47.781 --> 00:49.216
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:49.216 --> 00:50.851
LATE LAST NIGHT BY PASSING

00:50.851 --> 00:52.819
LEGISLATION THAT EXTENDS FUNDING

00:52.819 --> 00:54.254
FOR ONE MORE WEEK.

00:54.254 --> 00:55.188
THE PRESIDENT SIGNED IT JUST

00:55.188 --> 00:56.156
MINUTES BEFORE MIDNIGHT, WHEN

00:56.156 --> 00:57.824
FUNDING WOULD HAVE RUN OUT.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.626
BUT THE POLITICAL WRANGLING IS

00:59.626 --> 01:00.928
FAR FROM OVER.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.229
HOUSE REPUBLICANS REMAIN DEEPLY

01:02.229 --> 01:02.796
DIVIDED.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.997
SOME MEMBERS WON'T VOTE FOR

01:03.997 --> 01:05.599
FUNDING LEGISLATION UNLESS IT

01:05.599 --> 01:07.567
RESCINDS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

01:07.567 --> 01:09.569
IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.737
DEMOCRATS AND MODERATE

01:10.737 --> 01:12.539
REPUBLICANS ARE CRITICIZING THE

01:12.539 --> 01:14.107
TACTIC.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.510
>> IT'S THE 11th HOUR, AND WE

01:16.510 --> 01:18.245
MUST ACT TO PROVIDE STABLE,

01:18.245 --> 01:19.646
CONTINUOUS FUNDING FOR THE

01:19.646 --> 01:21.648
AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS TASKED

01:21.648 --> 01:24.418
WITH DEFENDING OUR HOME TURF.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.452
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE DETAILS

01:25.452 --> 01:26.787
ON THE POLITICS BEHIND THIS

01:26.787 --> 01:28.055
FUNDING FIGHT, I'M JOINED NOW

01:28.055 --> 01:29.823
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., BY "ROLL

01:29.823 --> 01:31.425
CALL" REPORTER NIELS LESNIEWSKI.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.759
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.795
WHY DID WE GET THIS CLOSE AGAIN

01:34.795 --> 01:35.896
TO ALMOST SHUTTING DOWN THE

01:35.896 --> 01:37.631
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY?

01:37.631 --> 01:38.799
>> WELL, THERE REALLY WAS THE

01:38.799 --> 01:40.901
SOMEWHAT SURPRISING, I THINK,

01:40.901 --> 01:42.436
FOR A LOT OF OBSERVERS,

01:42.436 --> 01:43.704
SITUATION THAT DEVELOPED IN THE

01:43.704 --> 01:46.006
HOUSE WHERE THE HOUSE WAS UNABLE

01:46.006 --> 01:48.308
TO PASS THE THREE-WEEK STOPGAP

01:48.308 --> 01:50.243
SPENDING BILL FOR HOMELAND

01:50.243 --> 01:51.845
SECURITY WHICH SENT EVERYONE

01:51.845 --> 01:54.781
SCRAMBLING WELL INTO THE EVENING

01:54.781 --> 01:56.817
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

01:56.817 --> 01:57.818
WHAT IT DOES, THOUGH, IS, IT

01:57.818 --> 01:59.653
SETS UP A TEST FOR THE COMING

01:59.653 --> 02:02.189
WEEK, REQUIRING BASICALLY THE

02:02.189 --> 02:03.657
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GO

02:03.657 --> 02:07.160
THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN

02:07.160 --> 02:09.162
SOME TIME MONDAY OR LATER IN THE

02:09.162 --> 02:10.097
WEEK.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.932
AND THE QUESTION WILL BE, ONCE

02:11.932 --> 02:14.301
AGAIN, DOES SPEAKER BOEHNER

02:14.301 --> 02:17.804
ALLOW THE FULL-YEAR FUNDING BILL

02:17.804 --> 02:19.006
FOR THE HOMELAND SECURITY

02:19.006 --> 02:20.007
DEPARTMENT THAT HAS ALREADY

02:20.007 --> 02:21.708
PASSED THE SENATE ON TO THE

02:21.708 --> 02:23.343
FLOOR OF HIS CHAMBER, OR IS

02:23.343 --> 02:25.579
THERE ANOTHER SORT OF STOPGAP?

02:25.579 --> 02:26.847
AND IS THE HOMELAND SECURITY

02:26.847 --> 02:27.981
DEPARTMENT GOING TO BE FUNDED

02:27.981 --> 02:30.350
WEEK-TO-WEEK FOR THE FORESEEABLE

02:30.350 --> 02:31.151
FUTURE?

02:31.151 --> 02:31.985
>> Sreenivasan: SO, IS THERE A

02:31.985 --> 02:33.720
RIFT NOW BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND

02:33.720 --> 02:36.156
SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.925
>> WELL, THERE'S A RIFT BETWEEN

02:38.925 --> 02:40.994
MANY PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE OF

02:40.994 --> 02:42.262
REPRESENTATIVES, I THINK, AND A

02:42.262 --> 02:43.997
LOT OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.132
I DON'T KNOW TO THE EXTENT AT

02:45.132 --> 02:46.333
WHICH IT GOES TO THE LEADERSHIP

02:46.333 --> 02:48.235
LEVEL, BUT WE'VE HEARD ANY

02:48.235 --> 02:50.837
NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS

02:50.837 --> 02:54.207
WHO ARE ON THE BALLOT IN 2016--

02:54.207 --> 02:55.709
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE IN

02:55.709 --> 02:57.778
STATES THAT WOULD BE MORE

02:57.778 --> 02:59.780
INCLINED TO VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT

02:59.780 --> 03:01.681
FOR THE SENATE-- WHO ARE SAYING

03:01.681 --> 03:03.083
THAT THIS FIGHT REALLY NEEDED TO

03:03.083 --> 03:04.284
BE RESOLVED AND THEY'RE JUST

03:04.284 --> 03:06.386
PUTTING OFF THE INEVITABLE OVER

03:06.386 --> 03:08.455
ON THE HOUSE SIDE BY USING THESE

03:08.455 --> 03:09.990
SHORT-TERM BILLS.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.091
WE'VE HEARD FROM THAT SENATOR

03:11.091 --> 03:12.492
MARK KIRK IN ILLINOIS AND

03:12.492 --> 03:13.226
OTHERS.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.061
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO, THIS

03:14.061 --> 03:15.929
ALSO MOVES THE CLOCK, RIGHT, ON

03:15.929 --> 03:17.898
WHAT OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION

03:17.898 --> 03:19.466
CONGRESS CAN TRY TO TACKLE, MUCH

03:19.466 --> 03:21.568
LESS GET APPROVED?

03:21.568 --> 03:22.903
>> EVERY TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO

03:22.903 --> 03:25.005
SPEND ANOTHER WEEK WRANGLING

03:25.005 --> 03:27.074
OVER IMMIGRATION AND FUNDING

03:27.074 --> 03:29.376
HOMELAND SECURITY DOING THE

03:29.376 --> 03:31.678
BASIC WORK OF GOVERNMENT, THE

03:31.678 --> 03:33.280
CLOSER THAT YOU GET TO OTHER

03:33.280 --> 03:35.749
THINGS REACHING THEIR DEADLINES.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.885
WE'RE ONLY ABOUT A MONTH AWAY

03:38.885 --> 03:40.821
FROM HAVING THE RECURRING

03:40.821 --> 03:42.255
PROBLEM OVER THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

03:42.255 --> 03:44.825
THAT DOCTORS GET PAID FOR

03:44.825 --> 03:46.660
TREATING PATIENTS WHO HAVE

03:46.660 --> 03:48.528
MEDICARE BENEFITS.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.596
AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF OTHER

03:49.596 --> 03:50.864
THINGS THAT ARE COMING UP, AND

03:50.864 --> 03:52.165
SO THE LONGER YOU SPEND ON THIS

03:52.165 --> 03:53.200
THE LESS TIME THERE IS TO

03:53.200 --> 03:54.901
ACTUALLY ADVANCE AN AGENDA

03:54.901 --> 03:56.169
RATHER THAN JUST PUTTING OUT

03:56.169 --> 03:57.104
FIRES.

03:57.104 --> 03:57.971
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, AND

03:57.971 --> 03:59.239
BRIEFLY, DO YOU KNOW IF THE

03:59.239 --> 04:00.373
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE HEARING

04:00.373 --> 04:02.109
FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT

04:02.109 --> 04:03.643
HOW THIS BRINKSMANSHIP MAYBE

04:03.643 --> 04:05.712
ISN'T REALLY FOR THEM?

04:05.712 --> 04:07.814
>> WELL, THERE'S BEEN SOME SIGN

04:07.814 --> 04:08.415
OF THAT.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.683
THE REAL SIGN OF THAT IS GOING

04:09.683 --> 04:12.219
TO COME ABOUT A WEEK FROM NOW

04:12.219 --> 04:13.553
BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS SCHEDULED

04:13.553 --> 04:15.622
TO GO OUT ON RECESS ACTUALLY IN

04:15.622 --> 04:16.857
MID-MARCH.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.358
THE SENATE'S GOING TO BE HERE

04:18.358 --> 04:19.659
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE EASTER

04:19.659 --> 04:21.595
BREAK, BUT THE HOUSE MEMBERS ARE

04:21.595 --> 04:22.729
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE GOING HOME

04:22.729 --> 04:24.264
FOR A WHOLE WEEK, AND THAT COULD

04:24.264 --> 04:25.765
BE FASCINATING TO WATCH.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.466
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.001
NIELS LESNLEWSKI FROM "ROLL

04:28.001 --> 04:28.702
CALL" JOINING US FROM

04:28.702 --> 04:29.769
WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.570
>> THANK YOU.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.872
>> Sreenivasan: IN RUSSIA, TOP

04:31.872 --> 04:32.772
INVESTIGATORS ARE SAYING THEY

04:32.772 --> 04:34.074
ARE LOOKING INTO "SEVERAL

04:34.074 --> 04:35.275
POSSIBLE MOTIVES" IN THE

04:35.275 --> 04:36.276
ASSASSINATION OF ONE OF

04:36.276 --> 04:37.577
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S MOST

04:37.577 --> 04:38.979
VOCAL CRITICS.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.480
55-YEAR-OLD BORIS NEMTSOV WAS

04:40.480 --> 04:42.215
GUNNED DOWN ON A PUBLIC STREET

04:42.215 --> 04:43.984
NEAR THE KREMLIN FRIDAY.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.051
PUTIN'S SPOKESMAN CALLED THE

04:45.051 --> 04:46.887
SHOOTING A "PROVOCATION" AGAINST

04:46.887 --> 04:47.721
THE STATE.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.089
WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM MOSCOW IN A

04:49.089 --> 04:49.756
MOMENT.

04:49.756 --> 04:50.690
THE TRIAL FOR THE ACCUSED

04:50.690 --> 04:52.125
MARATHON BOMBER WILL BE HELD IN

04:52.125 --> 04:54.227
BOSTON NEXT WEEK AFTER ALL.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.328
DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV'S DEFENSE

04:55.328 --> 04:57.197
ATTORNEY ARGUED THAT A BOSTON

04:57.197 --> 04:58.398
JURY WOULD BE BIASED BY

04:58.398 --> 05:00.233
PUBLICITY SURROUNDING THE CASE,

05:00.233 --> 05:02.035
BUT A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT

05:02.035 --> 05:03.069
DISAGREED.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.371
PROSECUTORS SAY TSARNAEV AND HIS

05:04.371 --> 05:05.906
BROTHER SET OFF TWIN EXPLOSIONS

05:05.906 --> 05:07.174
THAT KILLED THREE PEOPLE AND

05:07.174 --> 05:09.409
WOUNDED MORE THAN 260 OTHERS IN

05:09.409 --> 05:10.744
2013.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.179
HIS BROTHER, TAMERLAN, DIED IN A

05:12.179 --> 05:13.647
SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE FOUR DAYS

05:13.647 --> 05:14.381
LATER.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.515
THE WHITE HOUSE IS PROPOSING

05:15.515 --> 05:16.816
PRIVACY REFORM WHICH WOULD

05:16.816 --> 05:17.751
EMPOWER THE FEDERAL TRADE

05:17.751 --> 05:19.352
COMMISSION TO OVERSEE BOTH THE

05:19.352 --> 05:21.087
TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

05:21.087 --> 05:22.722
COMPANIES COLLECT FROM YOU, AND

05:22.722 --> 05:24.457
HOW THEY USE YOUR DATA.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.759
COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO SET UP A

05:25.759 --> 05:27.527
CODE OF CONDUCT AND SATISFY

05:27.527 --> 05:28.795
CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS LIKE

05:28.795 --> 05:30.764
PROVIDING CLEAR NOTICES ABOUT

05:30.764 --> 05:32.465
HOW YOUR DATA IS COLLECTED, USED

05:32.465 --> 05:33.300
AND SHARED.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.035
CONSUMER PRIVACY ADVOCATES SAY,

05:35.035 --> 05:36.570
HOWEVER, THAT LETTING COMPANIES

05:36.570 --> 05:37.470
COME UP WITH THE CODES OF

05:37.470 --> 05:39.139
CONDUCT IS A BAD IDEA.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.507
THE PROPOSAL STILL NEEDS A

05:40.507 --> 05:41.875
CONGRESSIONAL SPONSOR.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.076
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS

05:43.076 --> 05:44.578
CONFIRMING WHAT YOU'VE PROBABLY

05:44.578 --> 05:45.845
BEEN FEELING THIS MONTH.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.880
THIS HAS BEEN THE COLDEST

05:46.880 --> 05:48.748
FEBRUARY IN DECADES ACROSS THE

05:48.748 --> 05:50.483
NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.651
NEW YORK CITY MARKED THE COLDEST

05:51.651 --> 05:53.520
TEMPERATURES IN 81 YEARS, WITH

05:53.520 --> 05:55.655
AVERAGE TEMPERATURES 11 DEGREES

05:55.655 --> 05:57.224
LOWER THAN NORMAL.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.792
DETROIT ENDURED THE COLDEST

05:58.792 --> 06:01.828
FEBRUARY IN 140 YEARS.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.496
DESPITE THAT, CALIFORNIA IS IN

06:03.496 --> 06:04.864
THE MIDST OF ITS WARMEST AND

06:04.864 --> 06:07.200
DRIEST WINTER ON RECORD.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.377
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE NOW ON

06:17.377 --> 06:18.778
THE SHOOTING DEATH OF RUSSIAN

06:18.778 --> 06:20.947
OPPOSITION LEADER BORIS NEMTSOV,

06:20.947 --> 06:22.115
REPORTER ANDREW KRAMER HAS BEEN

06:22.115 --> 06:23.049
FOLLOWING THE STORY FOR THE "NEW

06:23.049 --> 06:23.617
YORK TIMES."

06:23.617 --> 06:24.684
HE JOINS US VIA SKYPE FROM

06:24.684 --> 06:25.218
MOSCOW.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.653
SO, FOR OUR AMERICAN AUDIENCE,

06:26.653 --> 06:27.821
WHO WAS HE?

06:27.821 --> 06:28.955
>> HE WAS A VERY INFLUENTIAL

06:28.955 --> 06:31.424
POLITICIAN IN THE 1990s.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.793
A VERY DASHING, HANDSOME UP-AND-

06:33.793 --> 06:35.695
COMER UNDER PRESIDENT BORIS

06:35.695 --> 06:36.663
YELTSIN.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.099
HE EMBODIED THE HOPES FOR

06:39.099 --> 06:40.400
DEMOCRATIC REFORM IN THE POST-

06:40.400 --> 06:42.636
SOVIET PERIOD IN RUSSIA.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.804
HE WAS GOVERNOR OF A REGION,

06:44.804 --> 06:46.539
THE NIZHNY NOVGOROD REGION, AND

06:46.539 --> 06:47.841
THEN MOVED INTO NATIONAL

06:47.841 --> 06:49.476
POLITICS.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.610
UNDER PRESIDENT PUTIN, HE WAS IN

06:50.610 --> 06:53.079
THE OPPOSITION, AND HE WAS PART

06:53.079 --> 06:54.481
OF A VERY SMALL AND BELEAGUERED

06:54.481 --> 06:56.483
COMMUNITY OF OPPONENTS OF MR.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.851
PUTIN, SOMETIMES STANDING ON THE

06:57.851 --> 07:00.920
STREET HOLDING SIGNS JUST WITH A

07:00.920 --> 07:01.755
FEW PEOPLE.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.355
>> Sreenivasan: PUT IN

07:02.355 --> 07:04.824
PERSPECTIVE FOR US, IF YOU CAN,

07:04.824 --> 07:06.926
HOW HE ROSE TO PROMINENCE AS A

07:06.926 --> 07:07.560
DISSIDENT.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.262
HE GOT CONDOLENCES FROM WORLD

07:09.262 --> 07:11.331
LEADERS AFTER HE WAS KILLED LAST

07:11.331 --> 07:12.232
NIGHT.

07:12.232 --> 07:12.966
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.367
HE WAS A VERY HIGH-PLACED

07:14.367 --> 07:15.402
POLITICIAN UNDER PRESIDENT

07:15.402 --> 07:18.438
YELTSIN IN THE 1990s, AND MANY

07:18.438 --> 07:19.673
OF HIS COLLEAGUES FROM THAT TIME

07:19.673 --> 07:21.341
WENT INTO BUSINESS OR DROPPED

07:21.341 --> 07:22.475
OUT OF PUBLIC VIEW.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.344
BUT HE, IN CONTRAST, DIVED INTO

07:24.344 --> 07:26.980
OPPOSITION POLITICS, AND HE WAS

07:26.980 --> 07:28.381
ARRESTED A NUMBER OF TIMES.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.716
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAD

07:29.716 --> 07:31.051
COUNTED HIM A PRISONER OF

07:31.051 --> 07:32.118
CONSCIENCE.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.254
AND HE WAS VERY HIGH PROFILE,

07:34.254 --> 07:35.522
OFTEN TRAVELED TO EUROPE AND MET

07:35.522 --> 07:37.691
WITH WORLD LEADERS.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.226
AND SO, IT'S NOT A SURPRISE WHEN

07:40.226 --> 07:41.695
THIS HAPPENED, THERE IS QUITE A

07:41.695 --> 07:43.697
BIT OF SUPPORT AND OUTPOURING OF

07:43.697 --> 07:46.333
CONDOLENCES FOR HIS FAMILY FROM

07:46.333 --> 07:47.400
WORLD LEADERS, INCLUDING

07:47.400 --> 07:48.335
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.102
>> Sreenivasan: SO, THE QUESTION

07:49.102 --> 07:50.770
FOR THE INVESTIGATION NOW IS,

07:50.770 --> 07:52.539
WHO IS BEHIND THE MURDER, RIGHT?

07:52.539 --> 07:54.507
I MEAN, THIS WAS... IT SAYS IT

07:54.507 --> 07:55.575
LOOKS LIKE A CONTRACT HIT, BUT

07:55.575 --> 07:57.977
WHO HAS MOTIVES TO KILL HIM?

07:57.977 --> 07:58.878
>> Reporter: THE POLICE HAVE PUT

07:58.878 --> 08:00.914
OUT A NUMBER OF THEORIES TODAY.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.016
SOME OF THEM ARE NOT CONSIDERED

08:03.016 --> 08:04.184
VERY PLAUSIBLE.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.186
THEY HAD SAID THAT MAYBE ISLAMIC

08:06.186 --> 08:07.787
MILITANTS WERE INVOLVED, OR THAT

08:07.787 --> 08:10.623
THE OPPOSITION HAD ITSELF

08:10.623 --> 08:12.425
ORGANIZED HIS MURDER AS A WAY TO

08:12.425 --> 08:14.294
CREATE A MARTYR AND INVIGORATE

08:14.294 --> 08:16.029
THEIR CAUSE.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.131
MR. NEMTSOV'S OWN COLLEAGUES

08:18.131 --> 08:19.666
HAVE POINTED THE FINGER AT THE

08:19.666 --> 08:20.700
KREMLIN AND AT THE SECURITY

08:20.700 --> 08:22.001
SERVICES HERE IN RUSSIA.

08:22.001 --> 08:22.769
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT DOES

08:22.769 --> 08:23.837
THIS DO TO ANY OF THE

08:23.837 --> 08:24.337
OPPOSITION?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.039
IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM

08:26.039 --> 08:27.374
TO BAND TOGETHER?

08:27.374 --> 08:28.174
>> THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR

08:28.174 --> 08:28.875
THAT HAPPENING.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.210
THE OPPOSITION IN RUSSIA HAS

08:30.210 --> 08:31.211
BEEN VERY FRACTURED AND

08:31.211 --> 08:32.512
MARGINALIZED.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.047
NOW, THEY'VE AGREED TO UNITE FOR

08:34.047 --> 08:35.648
A MEMORIAL MARCH TOMORROW IN

08:35.648 --> 08:36.583
MOSCOW.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.284
WE'LL SEE GOING FORWARD HOW

08:38.284 --> 08:39.519
SIGNIFICANT THIS EVENT IS, BUT

08:39.519 --> 08:40.954
MANY PEOPLE HERE THINK THAT IT'S

08:40.954 --> 08:42.155
PIVOTAL.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.690
THIS IS A GALVANIZING AND

08:43.690 --> 08:44.924
SEARING EXPERIENCE FOR THE

08:44.924 --> 08:47.594
OPPOSITION, AND NOW THERE IS A

08:47.594 --> 08:49.963
RALLYING CRY TO CONTINUE TO

08:49.963 --> 08:51.398
SUPPORT THE CAUSES THAT HE HAD

08:51.398 --> 08:52.098
LIVED FOR.

08:52.098 --> 08:52.799
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, HOW

08:52.799 --> 08:54.534
CLOSELY WILL THE WEST BE

08:54.534 --> 08:56.569
WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

08:56.569 --> 08:57.337
>> VERY CLOSELY.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.139
THIS IS BEING SEEN AS A PIVOTAL

08:59.139 --> 09:01.441
MOMENT FOR RUSSIAN POLITICS.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.709
SOME ARE SAYING THIS SUGGESTS A

09:02.709 --> 09:04.444
RETURN OF FEAR TO RUSSIAN

09:04.444 --> 09:07.280
POLITICS, EVEN OF TERROR.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.049
THIS IS REALLY A NEW HORIZON FOR

09:10.049 --> 09:11.684
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.086
WE'VE HAD DISSIDENTS ARRESTED

09:13.086 --> 09:13.987
BEFORE.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.523
WE'VE HAD THEM GO INTO EXILE.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.590
AND WE'VE HAD JOURNALISTS AND

09:17.590 --> 09:19.659
HUMAN RIGHTS WORKERS OBVIOUSLY

09:19.659 --> 09:20.493
DIE UNDER MYSTERIOUS

09:20.493 --> 09:21.661
CIRCUMSTANCES.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.630
BUT THIS WAS A SENIOR MEMBER OF

09:23.630 --> 09:24.397
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IN THE

09:24.397 --> 09:26.866
1990s, AND HE WAS SHOT VERY

09:26.866 --> 09:28.368
THEATRICALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF

09:28.368 --> 09:29.135
THE KREMLIN.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.069
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

09:30.069 --> 09:31.004
ANDREW KRAMER OF THE "NEW YORK

09:31.004 --> 09:32.338
TIMES" JOINING US VIA SKYPE FROM

09:32.338 --> 09:33.540
MOSCOW, THANKS SO MUCH.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.941
>> THANK YOU.

09:44.851 --> 09:45.652
>> Sreenivasan: NOW TO OUR

09:45.652 --> 09:46.953
SIGNATURE SEGMENT AND A TOPIC

09:46.953 --> 09:48.421
THAT CONTINUES TO WORRY MILLIONS

09:48.421 --> 09:50.423
OF PARENTS ACROSS THE NATION--

09:50.423 --> 09:51.925
THE RISK OF CONCUSSIONS TO

09:51.925 --> 09:53.693
CHILDREN WHO PLAY SOCCER.

09:53.693 --> 09:54.461
SOCCER HAS ALWAYS BEEN

09:54.461 --> 09:56.095
CONSIDERED A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO

09:56.095 --> 09:57.931
FOOTBALL, BUT, ACCORDING TO THE

09:57.931 --> 09:59.332
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL,

09:59.332 --> 10:01.334
ABOUT 10,000 CHILDREN LAND IN

10:01.334 --> 10:03.536
THE E.R. EVERY YEAR FOR SOCCER-

10:03.536 --> 10:05.205
RELATED HEAD INJURIES.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.840
AND NOW, A LEADING NEUROSURGEON

10:06.840 --> 10:08.575
AND ONE OF AMERICA'S BEST-KNOWN

10:08.575 --> 10:10.944
SOCCER STARS ARE GOING PUBLIC TO

10:10.944 --> 10:12.846
SAY THE GAME POSES RISKS NOT

10:12.846 --> 10:14.714
FULLY UNDERSTOOD BEFORE.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.182
WILLIAM BRANGHAM, HIMSELF A

10:16.182 --> 10:18.151
SOCCER DAD, HAS THIS UPDATE IN A

10:18.151 --> 10:19.853
REPORT WE ORIGINALLY BROADCAST

10:19.853 --> 10:22.255
IN OCTOBER.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.890
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE, MY MAN.

10:23.890 --> 10:24.891
WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A

10:24.891 --> 10:26.793
LITTLE LOOK AT YOUR EARS.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.727
>> Reporter: DR. RICHARD FLYER

10:27.727 --> 10:28.661
HAS BEEN MY FAMILY'S

10:28.661 --> 10:30.897
PEDIATRICIAN FOR 13 YEARS, AND,

10:30.897 --> 10:32.365
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, I LOVE THE

10:32.365 --> 10:32.866
GUY.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.034
I ADMIRE HIM, AND I TRUST HIM.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.903
BUT THREE YEARS AGO, WHEN MY SON

10:36.903 --> 10:38.538
JACK WAS TEN, FLYER SAID

10:38.538 --> 10:40.373
SOMETHING THAT FLOORED US.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.175
HE TOLD JACK HE WANTED HIM TO

10:42.175 --> 10:44.444
STOP PLAYING SOCCER COMPLETELY.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.179
FLYER ARGUED THAT THE DOZENS AND

10:46.179 --> 10:47.914
DOZENS OF KIDS HE'D SEEN OVER

10:47.914 --> 10:49.449
THE YEARS WITH SERIOUS,

10:49.449 --> 10:50.750
SOMETIMES LIFE-ALTERING

10:50.750 --> 10:52.018
CONCUSSIONS-- SOME OF THEM FROM

10:52.018 --> 10:53.553
HEADING THE BALL-- HAD CONVINCED

10:53.553 --> 10:56.055
HIM THAT SOCCER ITSELF WAS NOT

10:56.055 --> 10:56.923
SAFE.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.625
>> WE NEED TO LOOK AT THESE

10:58.625 --> 11:00.527
SPORTS REALISTICALLY AND SAY

11:00.527 --> 11:02.695
"ARE THEY REALLY SOMETHING WE

11:02.695 --> 11:04.097
WANT OUR CHILDREN TO DO?"

11:04.097 --> 11:06.065
DO WE WANT TO, IN THE NAME OF

11:06.065 --> 11:08.001
SPORT, PUT A CHILD'S BRAIN IN

11:08.001 --> 11:09.836
HARM'S WAY?

11:09.836 --> 11:10.770
>> Reporter: FLYER'S WARNING GOT

11:10.770 --> 11:12.438
ME AND MY WIFE TORY TO TAKE A

11:12.438 --> 11:14.073
LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE LOOK AT

11:14.073 --> 11:15.308
WHETHER THE SPORT OUR THREE KIDS

11:15.308 --> 11:16.843
LOVE IS SAFE.

11:16.843 --> 11:17.911
THE BENEFITS THEY GET OUT OF THE

11:17.911 --> 11:19.579
GAME, THOSE ARE OBVIOUS.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.647
BUT ARE THEY WORTH THE RISKS OF

11:20.647 --> 11:22.248
A REALLY BAD INJURY?

11:22.248 --> 11:23.449
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS,

11:23.449 --> 11:24.384
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH A

11:24.384 --> 11:25.718
DILEMMA THAT'S FACING REALLY

11:25.718 --> 11:27.053
MILLIONS OF PARENTS ACROSS THE

11:27.053 --> 11:28.521
COUNTRY.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.956
>> I JUST FEEL REALLY CONFUSED

11:29.956 --> 11:34.394
AND WORRIED AND JUST UNSURE WHAT

11:34.394 --> 11:35.461
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.329
>> Reporter: IT'S IMPORTANT TO

11:36.329 --> 11:38.431
SAY WE BECAME A SOCCER FAMILY

11:38.431 --> 11:39.933
PARTLY BY DESIGN.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.100
OUR THREE KIDS ARE JACK, WHO'S

11:41.100 --> 11:43.469
13, GAVIN IS 11, AND ALLY IS

11:43.469 --> 11:44.604
NINE.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.405
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE, THEY

11:45.405 --> 11:47.040
TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT SPORTS,

11:47.040 --> 11:47.840
BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO

11:47.840 --> 11:50.209
OFFICIALLY JOIN TEAMS, WE REALLY

11:50.209 --> 11:51.611
STEERED THEM TO SOCCER, WHICH WE

11:51.611 --> 11:52.879
THOUGHT WAS A "SAFE" SPORT

11:52.879 --> 11:53.947
COMPARED TO SOMETHING LIKE

11:53.947 --> 11:55.648
FOOTBALL.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.950
>> DON BROWN LEFT THE GAME WITH

11:56.950 --> 11:57.717
A CONCUSSION.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.652
>> I THINK I KNEW ENOUGH-- AND

11:59.652 --> 12:01.654
THIS IS NOW TEN YEARS AGO-- TO

12:01.654 --> 12:04.657
KNOW THAT I... FOOTBALL WASN'T

12:04.657 --> 12:06.960
REALLY AN OPTION FOR OUR KIDS.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.794
>> Reporter: BECAUSE IT WASN'T

12:07.794 --> 12:08.428
SAFE.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.329
>> BECAUSE IT WAS CONSIDERED

12:09.329 --> 12:10.263
UNSAFE.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.097
>> Reporter: IN 2008, THAT

12:11.097 --> 12:12.799
CONCERN WAS DRIVEN HOME BY A

12:12.799 --> 12:14.867
HORRIBLE ACCIDENT IN OUR TOWN.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.402
A 16 YEAR-OLD FOOTBALL PLAYER AT

12:16.402 --> 12:17.704
MONTCLAIR HIGH SCHOOL-- HIS NAME

12:17.704 --> 12:19.539
WAS RYNE DOUGHERTY-- DIED FROM A

12:19.539 --> 12:20.840
BRAIN INJURY HE GOT DURING A

12:20.840 --> 12:21.741
GAME.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.042
THE WHOLE TOWN WAS REALLY SHAKEN

12:23.042 --> 12:24.477
UP BY HIS DEATH.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.845
DID WE CONSOLE OURSELVES,

12:25.845 --> 12:27.447
THINKING, WELL, THAT COULDN'T

12:27.447 --> 12:28.715
HAPPEN TO OUR KIDS?

12:28.715 --> 12:29.682
I DON'T KNOW.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.617
MAYBE.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.485
BUT WE KEPT SIGNING THE KIDS UP,

12:32.485 --> 12:34.754
AND THEY LOVED IT.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.856
>> I REALLY LIKE PLAYING, HOW

12:36.856 --> 12:38.591
THERE ARE POSITIONS BECAUSE

12:38.591 --> 12:40.259
THERE'S, LIKE, A SPECIAL THING

12:40.259 --> 12:41.394
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU'RE

12:41.394 --> 12:42.895
DOING IT SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

12:42.895 --> 12:44.631
AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.366
>> YOU GET TO MOVE AROUND A LOT

12:46.366 --> 12:48.468
AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A GOOD

12:48.468 --> 12:50.236
TEAM, NOT JUST BE COMPOSED OF

12:50.236 --> 12:51.638
GOOD PLAYERS.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.905
>> SOCCER IS JUST THE BEST SPORT

12:52.905 --> 12:54.474
THERE IS, PERIOD.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.009
>> Reporter: BUT EVERY SO OFTEN,

12:56.009 --> 12:57.744
DR. FLYER'S CONCERNS WOULD ECHO

12:57.744 --> 12:59.479
IN THE BACK OUR OF HEADS.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.114
IN 2012, ONE OF JACK'S

13:01.114 --> 13:02.949
TEAMMATES, NICK GRAHAM, WENT UP

13:02.949 --> 13:04.884
FOR A HEADER, FELL TO THE GROUND

13:04.884 --> 13:05.752
AND SUFFERED SUCH A SEVERE

13:05.752 --> 13:07.253
CONCUSSION THAT HIS HEADACHES

13:07.253 --> 13:08.621
AND DIZZINESS DIDN'T GET BETTER

13:08.621 --> 13:09.656
FOR MONTHS.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.590
NICK LEFT THE TEAM, AND HE

13:10.590 --> 13:12.358
HASN'T PLAYED SINCE.

13:12.358 --> 13:13.559
WITHIN THE LAST YEAR, AT LEAST

13:13.559 --> 13:14.894
THREE OF JACK'S TEAMMATES

13:14.894 --> 13:16.462
SUFFERED CONCUSSIONS.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.131
DID THAT MAKE US THINK ABOUT

13:18.131 --> 13:19.465
TAKING JACK, OR ANY OF OUR KIDS,

13:19.465 --> 13:20.566
OUT OF SOCCER?

13:20.566 --> 13:22.368
HONESTLY, IT DIDN'T.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.303
SEEING THEM LEARN HOW IMPORTANT

13:24.303 --> 13:26.272
HARD WORK AND DEDICATION IS,

13:26.272 --> 13:27.473
WATCHING THEM DEAL WITH THEIR

13:27.473 --> 13:29.575
SUCCESSES AND THEIR FAILURES, IT

13:29.575 --> 13:31.911
ALL SEEMED WORTH IT TO US.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.846
>> IN THIS DAY AND AGE, THERE'S

13:33.846 --> 13:35.982
SO MANY WARNINGS, PARENTAL

13:35.982 --> 13:36.616
WARNINGS.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.684
IT'S NOT SAFE TO WALK TO SCHOOL,

13:37.684 --> 13:39.786
IT'S NOT SAFE TO DRINK THAT

13:39.786 --> 13:41.254
DRINK, IT'S NOT SAFE TO WATCH

13:41.254 --> 13:42.255
THAT SCREEN.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.457
THERE'S SO MANY "NOs."

13:44.457 --> 13:45.725
AND QUITE FRANKLY, SOME OF THE

13:45.725 --> 13:47.560
THINGS IN LIFE THAT ARE THE MOST

13:47.560 --> 13:49.162
FUN AND ARE THE MOST REWARDING

13:49.162 --> 13:50.730
HAVE SOME RISK INVOLVED.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.266
AND I'M NOT ENCOURAGING MY KIDS

13:53.266 --> 13:55.268
TO SKYDIVE.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.236
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, SOCCER IS

13:57.236 --> 13:58.971
FUN AND IT'S THRILLING AND IT'S

13:58.971 --> 13:59.806
EXCITING, AND...

13:59.806 --> 14:00.740
>> Reporter: AND IT GIVES THEM

14:00.740 --> 14:01.507
SO MUCH.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.608
>> ...AND IT GIVES THEM A LOT OF

14:02.608 --> 14:03.976
PLEASURE, SO I WASN'T PREPARED

14:03.976 --> 14:06.012
TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.480
>> Reporter: THEN CAME THE 2014

14:07.480 --> 14:09.248
WORLD CUP, WHICH WE ALL LOVED,

14:09.248 --> 14:10.550
BUT ALSO WHERE WE SAW SOME OF

14:10.550 --> 14:11.918
THOSE REALLY UGLY BLOWS TO THE

14:11.918 --> 14:12.885
HEAD.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.854
AND THEN I READ THIS STORY ABOUT

14:14.854 --> 14:16.589
A MOVEMENT TO TAKE HEADING OUT

14:16.589 --> 14:17.857
OF KIDS' SOCCER BECAUSE OF

14:17.857 --> 14:19.692
CONCERN OVER CONCUSSIONS.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.094
I MENTIONED THIS TO A FRIEND

14:21.094 --> 14:22.261
WHO'S SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE

14:22.261 --> 14:23.529
AROUND THE GAME.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.497
DECLAN CARNEY WAS BORN IN

14:24.497 --> 14:25.298
IRELAND.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.033
HE MANAGES MY SON JACK'S TEAM,

14:27.033 --> 14:27.834
AND OUR BOYS HAVE PLAYED

14:27.834 --> 14:28.735
TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.869
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

14:29.869 --> 14:31.471
CONCUSSIONS NEED TO BE DEALT

14:31.471 --> 14:32.972
WITH AND NEED TO BE TAKEN VERY

14:32.972 --> 14:35.074
SERIOUSLY WHENEVER THEY HAPPEN.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.243
BUT IF SOCCER, HEADING A SOCCER

14:37.243 --> 14:40.313
BALL WAS ACTUALLY A REAL DANGER

14:40.313 --> 14:42.749
OF SOME SORT OF BRAIN INJURY, I

14:42.749 --> 14:43.683
THINK IT WOULD'VE EXHIBITED

14:43.683 --> 14:45.485
ITSELF SOMEWHERE IN MEDICAL

14:45.485 --> 14:47.820
HISTORY IN EUROPE OR IN SOUTH

14:47.820 --> 14:50.556
AMERICA OR IN ASIA, WHERE PEOPLE

14:50.556 --> 14:52.125
PLAY SOCCER PRETTY MUCH ALL

14:52.125 --> 14:53.926
THEIR LIFE AND HAVE DONE FOR THE

14:53.926 --> 14:55.728
LAST 80, 100 YEARS.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.662
AND I DON'T THINK THE SCIENCE

14:56.662 --> 14:57.964
SAYS IT'S THERE.

14:57.964 --> 14:58.931
>> Reporter: I CHECKED, AND

14:58.931 --> 15:00.366
DECLAN IS RIGHT; THERE AREN'T

15:00.366 --> 15:01.868
ANY LARGE-SCALE, LONG TERM

15:01.868 --> 15:03.302
STUDIES CONNECTING SOCCER TO

15:03.302 --> 15:05.204
BRAIN INJURY AMONG THE MILLIONS

15:05.204 --> 15:06.839
OF SOCCER PLAYERS IN EUROPE OR

15:06.839 --> 15:08.641
SOUTH AMERICA OR ASIA.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.042
BUT THAT ARTICLE I READ CITED

15:10.042 --> 15:12.111
ONE SMALL AMERICAN STUDY SHOWING

15:12.111 --> 15:13.613
THAT ADULT AMATEUR SOCCER

15:13.613 --> 15:14.680
PLAYERS WHO HEADED THE BALL A

15:14.680 --> 15:16.883
LOT-- BETWEEN ABOUT 900 AND

15:16.883 --> 15:19.285
1,500 TIMES A YEAR, WHICH IS WAY

15:19.285 --> 15:20.787
MORE THAN ANY KID I KNOW EVER

15:20.787 --> 15:22.188
HEADS THE BALL-- THOSE PLAYERS

15:22.188 --> 15:23.589
SHOWED ABNORMALITIES IN THEIR

15:23.589 --> 15:25.258
BRAINS-- THEY'RE THE RED AND

15:25.258 --> 15:26.359
YELLOW SECTIONS HERE ON THESE

15:26.359 --> 15:28.361
SCANS-- THAT WERE VERY SIMILAR

15:28.361 --> 15:29.162
TO WHAT YOU'D SEE IN

15:29.162 --> 15:30.463
CONCUSSIONS.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.131
BUT MANY OF THESE PLAYERS SAID

15:32.131 --> 15:34.100
THEY HADN'T HAD CONCUSSIONS.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.434
THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT SOME

15:35.434 --> 15:36.869
KIND OF BRAIN TRAUMA MIGHT BE

15:36.869 --> 15:38.638
OCCURRING FROM A LOT OF HEADING

15:38.638 --> 15:40.306
WITHOUT PLAYERS BEING AWARE IT'S

15:40.306 --> 15:41.774
HAPPENING.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.342
THAT ARTICLE ALSO QUOTED THIS

15:43.342 --> 15:45.144
MAN, DR. ROBERT CANTU.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.479
HE'S A NEUROSURGEON, HE CO-

15:46.479 --> 15:48.047
DIRECTS A BRAIN STUDY CENTER AT

15:48.047 --> 15:49.715
BOSTON UNIVERSITY, AND HE'S ONE

15:49.715 --> 15:51.083
OF THE NATION'S TOP EXPERTS ON

15:51.083 --> 15:52.652
YOUTH CONCUSSIONS.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.120
CANTU ACKNOWLEDGES THE SCIENCE

15:54.120 --> 15:55.421
CONNECTING SOCCER WITH BRAIN

15:55.421 --> 15:56.756
INJURY IS LIMITED.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.024
HE'S IN FACT CALLED FOR MUCH

15:58.024 --> 15:59.458
MORE RESEARCH TO BE DONE.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.260
BUT EVEN SO, HE THINKS IT'S

16:01.260 --> 16:03.296
BETTER TO BE SAFE AND NOT ALLOW

16:03.296 --> 16:04.964
YOUNG KIDS TO REPEATEDLY HEAD

16:04.964 --> 16:05.798
THE BALL.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.966
>> IF YOU TOOK HEADING OUT OF

16:06.966 --> 16:08.935
SOCCER, IT WOULDN'T BE BEHIND

16:08.935 --> 16:10.670
FOOTBALL IN THE INCIDENCE OF

16:10.670 --> 16:11.704
CONCUSSION.

16:11.704 --> 16:12.772
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE IN THE HIGH-

16:12.772 --> 16:14.040
RISK GROUP.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.142
IT WOULD BE IN A LOW-RISK GROUP.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.310
>> Reporter: CANTU TOLD ME THAT

16:17.310 --> 16:18.644
HEADERS, AS WELL AS THE

16:18.644 --> 16:20.279
COLLISIONS AND THE HARD FALLS TO

16:20.279 --> 16:21.614
THE GROUND THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY

16:21.614 --> 16:23.416
THEM, ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR KIDS

16:23.416 --> 16:25.551
BECAUSE, UNLIKE ADULT BRAINS,

16:25.551 --> 16:26.652
KIDS' BRAINS ARE STILL

16:26.652 --> 16:27.653
DEVELOPING.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.455
>> THE YOUNG BRAIN IS LARGELY

16:29.455 --> 16:30.790
NOT MYELINATED.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.358
MYELIN IS THE COATING OF NERVE

16:32.358 --> 16:34.460
FIBERS THAT CONNECT NERVE CELLS.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.728
AND SO, WHEN YOU VIOLENTLY SHAKE

16:35.728 --> 16:37.530
THE YOUNG BRAIN, YOU HAVE A MUCH

16:37.530 --> 16:39.866
GREATER CHANCE TO DISRUPT NERVE

16:39.866 --> 16:42.268
FIBERS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS

16:42.268 --> 16:44.036
THAN YOU DO AN ADULT BRAIN.

16:44.036 --> 16:44.804
>> Reporter: CANTU SAYS

16:44.804 --> 16:46.105
STRENGTHENING A KID'S NECK

16:46.105 --> 16:47.840
MUSCLES CAN HELP, BUT THOSE

16:47.840 --> 16:49.475
SOCCER HELMETS AND HEADGEAR THAT

16:49.475 --> 16:51.143
HAVE BECOME POPULAR DON'T REALLY

16:51.143 --> 16:52.712
OFFER MUCH PROTECTION, SO HE

16:52.712 --> 16:54.814
SAYS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT

16:54.814 --> 16:55.548
TO DO.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.916
>> TAKE THE MOST INJURIOUS

16:56.916 --> 16:59.485
ACTIVITY FOR HEAD INJURY OUT OF

16:59.485 --> 17:01.520
IT, BUT LET THE REST OF THE

17:01.520 --> 17:02.355
SPORT GO ON.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.155
AND THAT'S PLAYING SOCCER

17:03.155 --> 17:04.490
WITHOUT HEADING.

17:06.926 --> 17:07.693
>> Reporter: SOME OTHERS WHO

17:07.693 --> 17:08.661
KNOW FAR MORE ABOUT THE GAME

17:08.661 --> 17:10.062
THAN I DO ARE ALSO LISTENING TO

17:10.062 --> 17:11.864
CANTU, ONE OF WHOM YOU MIGHT

17:11.864 --> 17:13.165
RECOGNIZE.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.433
BRANDI CHASTAIN'S DRAMATIC

17:14.433 --> 17:16.302
PENALTY SHOT AGAINST CHINA WON

17:16.302 --> 17:19.005
THE 1999 WORLD CUP FOR THE U.S.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.606
SHE ALSO HELPED WIN GOLD FOR THE

17:20.606 --> 17:22.675
U.S. AT TWO DIFFERENT OLYMPICS.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.743
SHE NOW LIVES IN NORTHERN

17:23.743 --> 17:25.278
CALIFORNIA WITH HER HUSBAND AND

17:25.278 --> 17:27.146
HER EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON JADEN.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.614
SHE COACHES HIS TEAM AND HELPS

17:28.614 --> 17:30.116
COACH A DIVISION ONE TEAM AT

17:30.116 --> 17:31.617
SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY.

17:31.617 --> 17:32.785
SHE, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OF HER

17:32.785 --> 17:34.186
FORMER TEAMMATES FROM THE U.S.

17:34.186 --> 17:35.922
NATIONAL TEAM, HAVE NOW JOINED

17:35.922 --> 17:37.323
FORCES WITH DR. CANTU'S

17:37.323 --> 17:39.091
ORGANIZATION.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.293
>> WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE HEADING

17:40.293 --> 17:43.062
IN YOUTH SOCCER, 14 AND YOUNGER.

17:43.062 --> 17:43.863
>> Reporter: THE INTERESTING

17:43.863 --> 17:45.564
THING IS, JUST A FEW YEARS AGO,

17:45.564 --> 17:47.700
CHASTAIN WAS ON NBC NEWS SAYING

17:47.700 --> 17:50.102
THAT HEADINGWASSAFE FOR KIDS

17:50.102 --> 17:51.037
AS LONG AS THEY WERE TRAINED

17:51.037 --> 17:52.338
CORRECTLY.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.539
>> IT'S A PART OF THE GAME, AND

17:53.539 --> 17:55.508
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART,

17:55.508 --> 17:57.076
AND I THINK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL

17:57.076 --> 17:57.944
PART OF THE GAME.

17:57.944 --> 17:58.744
>> Reporter: YOU, AT THE TIME,

17:58.744 --> 18:00.680
WERE SAYING, "I THINK THAT IT

18:00.680 --> 18:02.982
CAN BE TAUGHT TO KIDS, AND IT

18:02.982 --> 18:04.116
SHOULD STAY IN THE GAME FOR

18:04.116 --> 18:05.985
KIDS."

18:05.985 --> 18:07.086
NOW YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.254
I WONDER, WHAT WAS IT IN

18:08.254 --> 18:09.255
PARTICULAR THAT CHANGED YOUR

18:09.255 --> 18:10.156
MIND?

18:10.156 --> 18:12.892
>> I THINK IT WAS HEARING THE

18:12.892 --> 18:14.360
INFORMATION THAT DR. CANTU WAS

18:14.360 --> 18:15.194
PUTTING OUT.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.362
THE MORE I STARTED HEARING ABOUT

18:16.362 --> 18:17.663
IT AND THE MORE RESEARCH THAT

18:17.663 --> 18:19.598
HAS COME OUT, I JUST THOUGHT, I

18:19.598 --> 18:21.000
HAVE TO PROTECT THEM.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.335
AND I KNOW THAT SOCCER

18:22.335 --> 18:23.569
DOESN'T... THAT DOESN'T NEED TO

18:23.569 --> 18:25.371
EXIST AT THIS YOUNG AGE.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.172
>> Reporter: CHASTAIN SAYS

18:26.172 --> 18:27.340
TAKING HEADING OUT WON'T HURT

18:27.340 --> 18:28.674
THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG SOCCER

18:28.674 --> 18:29.442
PLAYERS.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.376
SHE SAYS THEY CAN STILL LEARN

18:30.376 --> 18:31.911
THE TECHNIQUES USING SOFTER

18:31.911 --> 18:33.546
BALLS AND THEN INTRODUCE IT BACK

18:33.546 --> 18:35.648
INTO GAMES WHEN THEY'RE 14.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.249
BUT SHE ADMITTED THAT SO FAR

18:37.249 --> 18:38.617
THEIR CAMPAIGN REALLY HASN'T

18:38.617 --> 18:39.719
TAKEN OFF.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.619
JUST A HANDFUL OF SOCCER

18:40.619 --> 18:41.754
PROGRAMS HAVE ACTUALLY REMOVED

18:41.754 --> 18:42.822
HEADING.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.457
SHE SAYS THE LEAD REALLY HAS TO

18:44.457 --> 18:45.758
COME FROM THE TOP, FROM THE

18:45.758 --> 18:46.892
INTERNATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES

18:46.892 --> 18:48.995
OF SOCCER-- FIFA AND THE U.S.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.629
SOCCER FEDERATION.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.630
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

18:51.630 --> 18:53.265
CURRENTLY BEING SUED BY A GROUP

18:53.265 --> 18:55.067
OF SOCCER PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA

18:55.067 --> 18:56.335
WHO SAY THEY HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH

18:56.335 --> 18:57.837
TO PROTECT KIDS FROM HEAD

18:57.837 --> 18:59.005
INJURY.

18:59.005 --> 18:59.672
WE REACHED OUT TO BOTH

18:59.672 --> 19:00.940
ORGANIZATIONS WHO SAID THE

19:00.940 --> 19:02.441
LITIGATION MADE IT HARD FOR THEM

19:02.441 --> 19:04.176
TO COMMENT, BUT BOTH TOLD US

19:04.176 --> 19:06.045
PLAYER SAFETY IS A PRIORITY.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.279
AND U.S. SOCCER ALSO TOLD

19:07.279 --> 19:09.015
NEWSHOUR THAT THEIR CONCUSSION

19:09.015 --> 19:10.449
POLICIES ARE REGULARLY BEING

19:10.449 --> 19:12.885
REVIEWED.

19:12.885 --> 19:13.953
BACK IN NEW JERSEY, THE SOCCER

19:13.953 --> 19:15.354
SEASON ROLLS ON.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.522
WE SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF HEADING,

19:16.522 --> 19:17.556
ESPECIALLY IN MY OLDER SON

19:17.556 --> 19:18.724
JACK'S GAMES.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.493
THE BOYS TAKE HARD ONES, THEY

19:20.493 --> 19:22.461
TAKE SOFT ONES, THEY SCORE GOALS

19:22.461 --> 19:23.429
WITH THEM.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.266
OUR SOCCER CLUB, MONTCLAIR

19:27.266 --> 19:29.368
UNITED, SAYS IT'S VERY CONCERNED

19:29.368 --> 19:30.870
ABOUT CONCUSSIONS AND TRAINS OUR

19:30.870 --> 19:32.138
COACHES THOROUGHLY.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.205
BUT THEY SAY THEY DON'T MAKE THE

19:33.205 --> 19:34.940
RULES, AND SO HEADING REMAINS A

19:34.940 --> 19:36.609
PART OF THE GAME.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.577
BUT OUR PEDIATRICIAN, DR. FLYER,

19:38.577 --> 19:40.312
SAYS TAKING HEADING OUT OF KIDS'

19:40.312 --> 19:42.148
SOCCER DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, IN

19:42.148 --> 19:43.349
HIS OPINION.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.850
HE SAYS WHAT HE'S SEEN IN HIS

19:44.850 --> 19:46.952
OWN PATIENTS FOR THREE DECADES

19:46.952 --> 19:48.454
IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH THAT THE

19:48.454 --> 19:50.356
SPORT ISN'T SAFE FOR KIDS.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.590
>> WE HAVE THIS 30-YEAR

19:51.590 --> 19:52.525
EXPERIMENT.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.692
YOU KNOW, THE RESULTS ARE COMING

19:53.692 --> 19:54.527
IN.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.128
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR CHILDREN TO DO

19:56.128 --> 19:57.063
THIS.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.864
IT'S A CONTACT SPORT THAT...

19:58.864 --> 20:00.566
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALMOST A

20:00.566 --> 20:01.867
EUPHEMISM NOW.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.336
IT'S A BRAIN-INJURING SPORT.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.905
AND IF I DON'T GET THIS

20:05.905 --> 20:07.706
INFORMATION ACROSS, EVEN AT THE

20:07.706 --> 20:10.709
RISK OF UPSETTING PEOPLE, I...

20:10.709 --> 20:11.777
I'VE FAILED.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.212
>> Reporter: SO, WHERE DOES ALL

20:13.212 --> 20:14.346
THIS LEAVE US?

20:14.346 --> 20:15.514
MY WIFE AND KIDS AND I STILL GET

20:15.514 --> 20:17.149
UP EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND

20:17.149 --> 20:18.217
GET READY FOR ANOTHER LONG

20:18.217 --> 20:19.685
WEEKEND OF SOCCER.

20:19.685 --> 20:20.753
BUT AFTER ALL THE INTERVIEWS AND

20:20.753 --> 20:22.521
RESEARCH I'VE DONE, TORY AND I

20:22.521 --> 20:24.223
RECENTLY TOLD OUR KIDS NOT TO

20:24.223 --> 20:25.758
HEAD THE BALL ANYMORE, NOT TILL

20:25.758 --> 20:27.093
THEY'RE 14.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.527
SO FAR, IT'S NOT BEEN AN ISSUE

20:28.527 --> 20:29.795
IN THEIR GAMES OR WITH THEIR

20:29.795 --> 20:31.163
COACHES.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.398
AND SINCE THIS STORY FIRST AIRED

20:32.398 --> 20:34.200
LAST FALL, OUR SOCCER CLUB HAS

20:34.200 --> 20:35.835
UPDATED ITS POLICIES ON HEADING

20:35.835 --> 20:37.103
AND HEAD INJURY.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.204
THEY'RE NOW OFFERING FREE

20:38.204 --> 20:39.905
BASELINE TESTING FOR ALL PLAYERS

20:39.905 --> 20:41.474
SO THAT IF A KID DOES GET A

20:41.474 --> 20:43.175
CONCUSSION, DOCTORS CAN KNOW HOW

20:43.175 --> 20:44.610
SERIOUS IT IS AND TRACK THEIR

20:44.610 --> 20:45.945
RECOVERY BETTER.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.113
THEY'RE ALSO UPDATING HOW THEY

20:47.113 --> 20:48.848
TEACH HEADING TECHNIQUES, USING

20:48.848 --> 20:50.816
SOFTER BALLS FOR YOUNG KIDS AND

20:50.816 --> 20:53.652
FOCUSING ON NECK STRENGTH.

20:53.652 --> 20:54.453
DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING THE

20:54.453 --> 20:55.821
RIGHT THING BY LETTING THEM

20:55.821 --> 20:57.456
PLAY?

20:57.456 --> 21:00.593
>> WE ARE SORT OF PUNTING THE

21:00.593 --> 21:02.628
BALL DOWN THE FIELD AND AVOIDING

21:02.628 --> 21:04.497
A DECISION, WHICH, IN AND OF

21:04.497 --> 21:06.365
ITSELF, IS A DECISION.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.433
OUR DECISION IS THAT WE'VE LET

21:07.433 --> 21:08.901
OUR KIDS CONTINUE TO PLAY

21:08.901 --> 21:09.969
SOCCER.

21:09.969 --> 21:10.669
>> Reporter: AND ARE YOU OKAY

21:10.669 --> 21:11.403
WITH THAT?

21:11.403 --> 21:13.005
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF

21:13.005 --> 21:14.607
JUST SIT THERE SECRETLY HOPING

21:14.607 --> 21:16.742
AT THE END OF EVERY GAME THAT

21:16.742 --> 21:18.911
THEY WALK OFF THE FIELD IN ONE

21:18.911 --> 21:20.012
PIECE.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.481
I JUST WANT THEM TO BE WHOLE.

21:23.649 --> 21:24.783
>> Sreenivasan: WANT TO KNOW

21:24.783 --> 21:26.185
MORE ABOUT THE CONCUSSION RISKS

21:26.185 --> 21:27.953

21:38.531 --> 21:40.366
