02:53.233 --> 02:54.200

>> YOU KNOW, I THINK SO,

03:16.867 --> 03:17.300
HARI.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.267
IT'S SORT OF A COMBINATION

03:18.267 --> 03:19.400
OF A FESTIVAL ENVIRONMENT

03:19.400 --> 03:20.667
AND TOTAL LOCKDOWN.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.167

03:22.767 --> 03:23.967

03:33.533 --> 03:34.967

03:34.967 --> 03:36.167
THE TIME WE WERE IN.

03:36.167 --> 03:37.700
SO THERE'S A LOT OF LOCKDOWN

03:37.700 --> 03:38.633
HERE IF PHILLIE.

03:38.633 --> 03:39.567
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY, WHEN

CORRESPONDENT MILES O'BRIEN.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.733
WHY IS THIS SO SIGNIFICANT

18:40.733 --> 18:41.600
FOR PEOPLE?

18:41.600 --> 18:44.067
>> WHEN THE MOON TURNS BIG,

18:44.067 --> 18:45.700
14% BIGGER AS IT DOES DURING

18:45.700 --> 18:47.800

18:51.267 --> 18:52.567
THIS IS ITS CLOSEST POINT, AND

18:52.567 --> 18:53.500
THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU

18:53.500 --> 18:54.900
GET A TOTAL ECLIPSE, THIS IS

18:54.900 --> 18:56.967
THE FOURTH IN A SO-CALLED LUNAR

18:56.967 --> 19:01.167
TETRAD THAT BEGAN.

19:01.167 --> 19:02.767
FOUR ECLIPSES IN A ROW.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.000

19:04.000 --> 19:04.733
ARE GOING CRAZY.

WHY DOES IT TURN RED ORANGE,

19:06.867 --> 19:07.767
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

19:07.767 --> 19:09.133
>> WHEN YOU SEE AN ECLIPSE

19:09.133 --> 19:10.567
OF THE SUN, THE MOON IS

19:10.567 --> 19:11.867
PASSING FROM THE SUN AND YOU

19:11.867 --> 19:13.033
GET THAT DARK DISK.

19:13.033 --> 19:14.567
IT TAKES A BITE OUT OF THE

19:14.567 --> 19:15.500
SUN AS IT WERE.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.567
IN THIS CASE, THE EARTH IS

19:17.567 --> 19:18.733
ECLIPSING THE SUN'S RAYS ON

19:18.733 --> 19:19.567
TO THE MOON.

19:19.567 --> 19:20.967

19:20.967 --> 19:22.700
OWN, IT'S REFLECTED LIGHT.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.733
WHAT HAPPENS IS, THINK OF IT,

19:24.733 --> 19:26.800
THE COLORS YOU SEE AT SUNSET,

19:26.800 --> 19:27.900
AS THE LIGHT GOES THROUGH

19:27.900 --> 19:29.867
THE ATMOSPHERE OF EARTH, IT

19:29.867 --> 19:30.933
GETS BOUNCED AROUND,

19:30.933 --> 19:32.200
SEPARATED, RETRACTED AND

19:32.200 --> 19:33.833
WHAT ENDS UP SHINING ON TO

19:33.833 --> 19:35.133
THE MOON AN GETTING TO THE

19:35.133 --> 19:36.633
MOON IS THE RED RANGE OF

19:36.633 --> 19:37.367
LIGHT.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.733
AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT

19:38.733 --> 19:40.167
KIND OF REDDISH ORANGE.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.167
NOW IF YOU ARE A TOTAL PRO,

19:42.167 --> 19:43.267
LOOK AT THE BEGINNING AND

19:43.267 --> 19:43.767
THE END.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.467
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE

19:45.467 --> 19:46.567
LOOKING FOR THE GREEN FLASH

19:46.567 --> 19:48.133
WHEN ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THE

19:48.133 --> 19:49.433
SUNSET AM WILL YOU SEE A

19:49.433 --> 19:50.467
BLUE OR VIOLET BAND THAT

19:50.467 --> 19:51.733
WILL APPEAR THERE BECAUSE AS

19:51.733 --> 19:53.567
THE SUN PASSES THROUGH THE

19:53.567 --> 19:56.467
OZONE LAYER ON EARTH, IT

19:56.467 --> 19:57.233
RETRACTS SLIGHTLY

19:57.233 --> 19:58.333
DIFFERENTLY AND YOU GET A

19:58.333 --> 20:00.567
BLUE TOCHBLT GET BINOCULARS

20:00.567 --> 20:01.800
OUT AT THE BEGINNING AND END

20:01.800 --> 20:03.000
AND YOU MIGHT CATCH THAT

20:03.000 --> 20:03.833
BLUE BAND.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.200
>> UNLIKE THE SOLAR ECLIPSE,

20:05.200 --> 20:06.967
THIS IS TOTALLY SAFE TO SEE.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.433
>> IT'S GREAT, THE BEST VIEWING

20:08.433 --> 20:09.300
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

20:09.300 --> 20:10.133
ABOUT LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE

20:10.133 --> 20:10.800
MOON.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.833
IT'S ALL REFLECTED.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

20:13.600 --> 20:14.633
BINOCULARS, YOU CAN JUST GO

20:14.633 --> 20:16.500
OUT AND ENJOY IT AND IT'S

20:16.500 --> 20:17.567
TOTALLY IN PRIME TIME FOR

20:17.567 --> 20:19.433
THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S.,

20:19.433 --> 20:20.267
ASSUME NOTHING CLOUD COVER,

20:20.267 --> 20:22.167
WILL YOU GET QUITE A SHOW.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.333
>> ABOUT 10 TO 11 ON THE

20:23.333 --> 20:24.467
EAST COAST AND THAT MEANS

20:24.467 --> 20:25.733
ABOUT 7:00 ON THE WEST

20:25.733 --> 20:26.567
COAST.

20:26.567 --> 20:27.767
>> YEAH, BY THE TIME THE

20:27.767 --> 20:28.833
MOONRISES ON THE WEST COAST,

20:28.833 --> 20:30.400
IT WILL ALREADY BE UNDER WAY

20:30.400 --> 20:31.633
BUT THEY WILL STILL GET A

20:31.633 --> 20:32.167
SHOW THERE.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.033
THE FULL PRIME TIME SHOW

20:33.033 --> 20:34.567
WILL BE ON THE EAST COAST.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.967
AND YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE

20:35.967 --> 20:37.333
THING REALLY BEGINS AROUNDED

20:37.333 --> 20:40.133
8:00 P.M., HOUR, ALL THE WAY

20:40.133 --> 20:41.400
INTO MIDNIGHT BUT THE ACTUAL

20:41.400 --> 20:43.100
PEAK OF IT WILL BE 10 P.M.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.467
EASTERN TIME ON THE EAST

20:44.467 --> 20:45.300
COAST.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.067
AND IT'S WORTH A LOOK.

20:47.067 --> 20:47.867
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN

20:47.867 --> 20:49.233
AN AREA WHERE IT'S

20:49.233 --> 20:50.567
INCLUDEDDY, AND THESE THINGS

20:50.567 --> 20:51.667
HAPPEN, THERE'S ABOUT THREE

20:51.667 --> 20:53.233
OR FOUR PLACES ON-LINE WHERE

20:53.233 --> 20:54.633
YOU CAN SEE STREAMING

20:54.633 --> 20:57.100
WEBCAST, NASA TV IS DOING IT,

20:57.100 --> 20:59.800
SKY AND TELESCOPE, SLEW IS

20:59.800 --> 21:00.667
DOING IT, YOU WILL BE ABLE

21:00.667 --> 21:02.433
TO SEE IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.200
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS IT

21:03.200 --> 21:04.633
ABOUT THIS THAT FASCINATES

21:04.633 --> 21:05.133
US?

21:05.133 --> 21:06.267
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FASCINATED

21:06.267 --> 21:08.200
BY ECLIPSES FOR AS LONG AS

21:08.200 --> 21:09.400
HISTORY HAS BEEN WRITTEN.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.733
>> OH MY GOD, SOMETHING

21:10.733 --> 21:11.333
STOPPED THE UPON OR

21:11.333 --> 21:12.167
SOMETHING CHANGED THE COLOR

21:12.167 --> 21:13.467
OF THE SUN WHAT HAPPENED?

21:13.467 --> 21:14.467
>> SCIENCE HAS FILLED IN A

21:14.467 --> 21:15.733
LOT OF BLANKS FOR US IN

21:15.733 --> 21:16.367
RECENT YEARS.

21:16.367 --> 21:17.633
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SIMPLY

21:17.633 --> 21:19.467
AN ALIGNMENT OF PLANETS AND

21:19.467 --> 21:21.667
WHEN THE ORBITS LINE UP IN A

21:21.667 --> 21:22.867
CERTAIN WAY THE SUN, EARTH

21:22.867 --> 21:24.400
AN MOON LINE UP PERFECTLY,

21:24.400 --> 21:25.133
YOU GET THIS.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.500
THAT MAKES IT SOUND KIND OF

21:26.500 --> 21:27.433
CLINICAL BUT BEFORE WE KNEW

21:27.433 --> 21:29.133
A LOT ABOUT THIS, THESE WERE

21:29.133 --> 21:30.867
LOOKED AT AS OMENS.

21:30.867 --> 21:31.867
ECLIPSES IN PARTICULAR HAVE

21:31.867 --> 21:33.400
ALWAYS BEEN LOOKED AT AS

21:33.400 --> 21:35.267
SOME INDICATION THAT

21:35.267 --> 21:36.433
SOMETHING USUALLY BAD IS

21:36.433 --> 21:37.867
GOING TO HAPPEN.

21:37.867 --> 21:39.600
SO I THINK WE KNOW

21:39.600 --> 21:40.833
SCIENTIFICALLY THAT ISN'T

21:40.833 --> 21:42.067
NECESSARILY THE CASE.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.333
BUT THERE'S STILL PEOPLE OUT

RESIDENT WHO HAS BEEN HELD AT

TRUE PERSON, RIGHT PERSON OR

SOMEONE ELSE.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.833
RAISED SHAKER'S CASE WITH

23:03.833 --> 23:05.033
OBAMA, THERE WILL BE A LOT

23:05.033 --> 23:05.633
OF QUESTIONS.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.433
>> HE WAS CAPTURED IN 2001

23:07.433 --> 23:08.867
IN AV GANG STAND AND HANDED

23:08.867 --> 23:10.233
OVER TO U.S. FORCES.

23:10.233 --> 23:11.833
HE WAS TRANSFERED TO

23:11.833 --> 23:13.467
GUANTANAMO A YEAR LATER

23:13.467 --> 23:14.967
ACCUSED OF WORKING FOR AL

23:14.967 --> 23:15.967
QAEDA.

23:15.967 --> 23:17.333
THERE HIS LAWYERS CLAIM HE

23:17.333 --> 23:19.800
WAS BEATEN AND TORTURED.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.133
IN 2007 AFTER A DIRECT

23:22.133 --> 23:23.300
REQUEST FROM THE BRITISH

23:23.300 --> 23:24.400
GOVERNMENT, HE WAS CLEARED

23:24.400 --> 23:26.267
FOR RELEASE ALONG WITH FOUR

23:26.267 --> 23:28.167
OTHER U.K. PRISONERS.

23:28.167 --> 23:30.167
AND TWO YEARS LATER HE WAS

23:30.167 --> 23:31.400
CLEARED AGAIN.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.167
BUT DESPITE THAT, THERE WERE

23:33.167 --> 23:34.967
SOME CONCERNS IN WASHINGTON

23:34.967 --> 23:37.867
ABOUT HIS EMINENT RELEASE

23:37.867 --> 23:38.800
-- IMMINENT RELEASE.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.233
>> I BELIEVE HE IS A VERY

23:41.233 --> 23:42.300
DANGEROUS PERSON.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.767
I'M CONCERNED THAT IF HE

23:44.767 --> 23:47.533
WERE RELEASED, AS MY

23:47.533 --> 23:48.500
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESULT

23:48.500 --> 23:50.067
WOULD BE, HE WOULD BE SET

23:50.067 --> 23:52.733
FREE AND COULD RECEIVE A

23:52.733 --> 23:54.767
FINANCIAL WINDFALL, EVEN.
