TESTED MODEL.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE USED THIS AS THE IRAQI

16:35.800 --> 16:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY HAS LIBERATED THE

16:37.633 --> 16:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PARTICULARLY IN THE PAST.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE UNITED NATIONS, UNITED

STATES AND ESPECIALLY THE IRAQI

16:47.300 --> 16:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT HAVE IMPROVED EACH

16:49.433 --> 16:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME THAT THEY LIBERATE A CITY

16:51.900 --> 16:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WORK ON REPAIRING THE

16:54.433 --> 16:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVICES.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MOSUL IS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE

16:56.600 --> 16:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THE LARGEST CITY THAT WILL

16:58.567 --> 17:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE TO BE LIBERATED AND

17:01.200 --> 17:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REHABILITATED.

17:01.633 --> 17:04.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

17:04.667 --> 17:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

17:06.233 --> 17:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS PUT TOGETHER A VERY GOOD

17:08.233 --> 17:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS,

17:10.467 --> 17:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES IN

17:11.833 --> 17:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE EFFORTS.

THESE OTHER CITIES YOU MENTIONED

17:15.467 --> 17:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE A MODEL TO WHAT YOU HOPE

17:17.333 --> 17:19.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL HAPPEN IN MOSUL?

17:19.167 --> 17:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE REHABILITATION FOR THE

17:20.467 --> 17:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER CITIES HAS REALLY BEEN A

17:22.433 --> 17:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LABORATORY FOR THE WAY TO DO

17:23.867 --> 17:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE.

17:26.133 --> 17:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EACH CITY HAS HAD A DIFFERENT

17:28.200 --> 17:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE WITH DAESH AND WITH

17:32.500 --> 17:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR, SO THE STABILIZATION

17:34.900 --> 17:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REHABILITATION OF EACH CITY HAS

17:36.067 --> 17:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

17:38.167 --> 17:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CITY OF

17:40.733 --> 17:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIKRIT, MORE THAN 95% OF THE

17:42.667 --> 17:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIAN POPULATION HAS RETURNED

17:44.633 --> 17:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THEIR HOMES.

17:45.967 --> 17:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOLS ARE OPEN, UNIVERSITY HAS

17:48.200 --> 17:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REOPENED.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SHOPS AND TRAFFIC SEEM VERY

17:52.533 --> 17:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSE TO NORMAL.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN CITIES LIKE RAMADI WHERE

17:55.600 --> 17:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS MORE DESTRUCTION, A

17:58.400 --> 17:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE

17:59.233 --> 18:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULATION HAS RETURNED BUT

18:00.633 --> 18:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE STILL AREAS OF THE

18:02.067 --> 18:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY THAT LITERALLY HAVE TO BE

18:04.133 --> 18:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REBUILT AND THAT WILL TAKE SOME

18:06.000 --> 18:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME FOR BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND

18:07.767 --> 18:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WHO

18:09.067 --> 18:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE TO GO BACK AND RECOVER

18:10.467 --> 18:12.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR LIVES AFTER THE WAR.

18:12.667 --> 18:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE KURDISH FIGHTERS, THE

18:15.400 --> 18:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PESHMERGA HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL FOR

18:18.133 --> 18:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FIGHT, BUT SOME OF THE

18:20.467 --> 18:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERS EXPRESSED THEIR

18:21.867 --> 18:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASPIRATION FOR INDEPENDENCE,

18:22.967 --> 18:24.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY COMPLEX GIVEN

18:24.767 --> 18:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE PLAYERS.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS THE U.S. POSITION ON

18:28.867 --> 18:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURDISH INDEPENDENCE.

18:30.267 --> 18:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT I HAVE BEEN MOST

18:31.333 --> 18:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPRISED AND PLEASED BY, IN THE

18:32.900 --> 18:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN MOSUL HAS

18:34.967 --> 18:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN THE VERY HIGH DEGREE OF

18:37.200 --> 18:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPERATION AND COORDINATION

18:38.900 --> 18:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE IRAQI ARMY AND THE

18:42.633 --> 18:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURDISH PESHMERGA FIGHTERS.

18:47.267 --> 18:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THERE IS RETICENCE ON

18:48.533 --> 18:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH SIDES TO COOPERATE AT THE

18:49.333 --> 18:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGINNING BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT

18:50.467 --> 18:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF AMERICAN ASSISTANCE, THEY

18:52.200 --> 18:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE PUT TOGETHER A VERY GOOD

18:54.433 --> 18:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINT BATTLE PLAN FOR MOSUL AND

18:56.733 --> 19:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EACH SIDE HAS BEEN WORKING VERY

19:00.500 --> 19:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HONESTLY AND OPENLY IN

19:02.367 --> 19:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATING WITH THE OTHER ON

19:03.767 --> 19:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ACTUAL OPERATIONS

19:05.067 --> 19:05.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES.

19:05.967 --> 19:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW AS FOR, IN THE POLITICAL

19:10.000 --> 19:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERSHIP, THIS COOPERATION HAS

19:12.200 --> 19:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO SPARKED GOOD WILL AND

19:15.167 --> 19:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPERATION BETWEEN IRAQI PRIME

19:16.967 --> 19:19.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINISTER ABADI AND IRAQI KURD

19:19.967 --> 19:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAND REGION PRESIDENT BARZANI.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE HAD MORE CONVERSATIONS

19:26.900 --> 19:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN USUAL AND BARZANI HAS COME

19:29.100 --> 19:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO VISIT ABADI IN BAG

19:31.700 --> 19:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAN-- BAGHDAD, SOMETHING HE

19:32.767 --> 19:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HASN'T DONE MUCH IN THE PAST.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PRESIDENT ABADI HAS VISITED

19:39.433 --> 19:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT BARZANI AS WELL.

19:41.533 --> 19:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I'M CONFIDENT THE

19:44.433 --> 19:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION AND POLITICAL LEVEL

19:46.167 --> 19:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD WIL AND COOPERATION WILL

19:47.833 --> 19:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE US WITH A GOOD PATHWAY

19:50.067 --> 19:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORWARD FOLLOWING THE MOSUL

19:51.800 --> 19:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NOW SIR, YOU WORK IN THE

19:54.467 --> 19:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREEN ZONE WHICH IS NORMALLY A

19:55.967 --> 19:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURE AND SAFE AREA.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT WAS PREPARED EARLIER THIS

19:58.533 --> 19:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW LATE LAST MONTH THERE WAS

20:01.167 --> 20:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SECURITY WARNING ISSUED FOR

20:03.967 --> 20:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS SPECIFICALLY

20:04.867 --> 20:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTIONING POTENTIAL KIDNAPPINGS

20:06.833 --> 20:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PEOPLE WORKING FOR NGO'S.

20:08.967 --> 20:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE YOUR SAFETY CONCERNS

20:10.233 --> 20:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR AMERICANS IN IRAQ CURRENTLY?

20:12.767 --> 20:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ALISON, IT IS STILL A

20:15.167 --> 20:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MODERATELY DANGEROUS PLACE IN

20:16.200 --> 20:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

20:18.100 --> 20:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE PRETTY SAFE.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY MEMBERS

20:21.933 --> 20:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DAESH WHO ARE ABLE TO ESCAPE

20:24.900 --> 20:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN

20:27.167 --> 20:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISOLATED BY THE IRAQI MILITARY

20:29.533 --> 20:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CONDUCT SOME ATTACKS.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROGRESS THAT

20:33.867 --> 20:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IRAQI ARMY AND THE IRAQI

20:35.767 --> 20:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST

20:37.333 --> 20:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIX MONTHS, YOU WILL SEE

20:39.233 --> 20:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY FOR THE LARGE

20:40.633 --> 20:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIES LIKE BAGHDAD, THE NUMBER

20:44.033 --> 20:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ATTACKS, ARMED ATTACKED OR

20:47.867 --> 20:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOMBING ATTACKS HAS DROPPED

20:49.800 --> 20:51.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANTLY AS SECURITY HAS

20:51.067 --> 20:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIGHTENED.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FRANKLY AS THE INTELLIGENCE

20:54.167 --> 20:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND COOPERATION THAT WORKS WITH

20:56.467 --> 20:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION AND

20:59.700 --> 21:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN IRAQI POLICE AND

21:01.967 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY AGENCIES HAVE IMPROVED.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT IS STILL A DANGEROUS

21:09.067 --> 21:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE.

21:09.833 --> 21:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE STILL CAUTION AMERICANS

21:10.933 --> 21:12.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE VERY SURE OF YOUR SECURITY

21:12.267 --> 21:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE YOU COME TO

21:14.467 --> 21:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE SEE IN GENERAL THAT THE

21:17.633 --> 21:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY SITUATION IS IMPROVING.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE HOPE THAT ONCE DAESH IS

21:23.367 --> 21:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSHED OUT OF IRAQ, THE SECURITY

21:25.933 --> 21:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENT WILL IMPROVE EVEN

21:27.300 --> 21:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE.

21:28.733 --> 21:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MR. AMBASSADOR, WHAT DO YOU

21:29.733 --> 21:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

21:31.100 --> 21:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION,

21:33.067 --> 21:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST

21:36.033 --> 21:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHALLENGE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

21:37.633 --> 21:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS TRYING TO DECIDE HOW MUCH,

21:40.433 --> 21:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE NEXT STEP WILL BE IN

21:42.733 --> 21:44.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP WITH

21:44.667 --> 21:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW THAT PRIME MINISTER ABADI

21:47.200 --> 21:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WEEK CALLED PRESIDENT-ELECT

21:49.500 --> 21:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP AND HE SAYS THAT HE HAD A

21:51.400 --> 21:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY GOOD CONVERSATION WITH

21:54.167 --> 21:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS

21:57.400 --> 21:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE TO BE

21:59.467 --> 22:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SOLID ONE UNDER THE NEW
