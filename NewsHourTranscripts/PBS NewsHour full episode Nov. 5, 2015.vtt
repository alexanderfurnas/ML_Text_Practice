HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan. Gwen Ifill
and Judy Woodruff are away.

00:09.977 --> 00:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Britain's prime minister says a
bomb is a possible cause in

00:14.214 --> 00:20.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mysterious plane crash above
Sinai, but Russia and Egypt deny
those claims.

00:20.487 --> 00:25.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: inside America's
nuclear arsenal. We take a look
at it's newest $8 billion
upgrade.

00:25.259 --> 00:29.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. GARRETT HARENCAK, U.S.
Air Force: We're bringing this
weapon to the 21st century.

00:29.763 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're bringing it to 2015. We
are updating its components.
We're making it safer, more

00:35.869 --> 00:38.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
secure, and we're making
it more effective.

00:38.272 --> 00:42.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, George
H.W. Bush reveals what he really
thinks about Dick Cheney and

00:42.910 --> 00:47.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Rumsfeld in Jon Meacham's
new biography on the former
president.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM, Author, "Destiny
and Power: The American Odyssey
of George Herbert Walker

00:48.548 --> 00:53.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bush": George H.W. Bush said
that he believed that Cheney was
responsible for a good bit

00:53.854 --> 01:00.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of that hawkish image and that
he wished that Cheney had not
had as much influence, that

01:00.027 --> 01:02.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he -- that Dick Cheney should
have had his -- quote -- "own
State Department."

01:02.663 --> 01:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

01:04.898 --> 01:10.804 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.804 --> 01:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The crash of a
Russian jetliner in Egypt
morphed into an international
dispute

01:23.216 --> 01:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today on whether a bomb was
behind it. All 224 people on
board were killed when the plane

01:28.121 --> 01:32.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broke up Saturday, just 23
minutes after taking of from
Sharm el-Sheikh.

01:32.793 --> 01:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the leaders of Britain,
Russia and Egypt are openly
disagreeing about the cause.

01:37.764 --> 01:42.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: We cannot be certain
that the Russian airliner

01:42.436 --> 01:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was brought down by a terrorist
bomb. But it looks increasingly
likely that that was

01:46.039 --> 01:48.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the case.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: British Prime
Minister David Cameron spent the
day defending his decision

01:51.979 --> 01:57.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stop all British flights to
and from Sharm el-Sheikh in
Egypt, pending the crash
investigation.

01:57.751 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON: The reason we
have acted before that is
because of the intelligence and
information

02:02.122 --> 02:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we had that gave us the concern
that it was more likely than not
it was a terrorist bomb.

02:07.761 --> 02:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Russian
officials insisted any talk that
a bomb destroyed the Metrojet

02:11.765 --> 02:16.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airliner is just speculation.
And the Russian Foreign Ministry
urged Britain to share any

02:16.103 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intelligence it has.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ZAKHAROVA, Russian Foreign
Ministry (through translator):
Honestly, what's really

02:21.274 --> 02:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shocking is the realization that
the British government has some
kind of information that

02:25.712 --> 02:30.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
could shed light on what
happened in the skies above
Egypt. That information, if it
exists,

02:30.617 --> 02:34.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and judging by the fact that the
head of the Foreign Office
pronounced it does exist, that

02:34.021 --> 02:37.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information was never shared
with the Russian side.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Kremlin
said President Vladimir Putin
raised those concerns in a

02:40.660 --> 02:45.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone call with Prime Minister
Cameron. Meanwhile, Egypt's
government maintained the crash
of

02:45.232 --> 02:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russian jet -- quote --
"wasn't a terror act." And under
a new law, news organizations

02:49.936 --> 02:55.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there that report anything to
contrary could face hefty fines.

02:55.909 --> 03:00.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Egyptian president, Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi, was in London
today to meet with Cameron.

03:00.714 --> 03:05.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
El-Sisi has warned against
expecting much from the
investigation anytime soon. But
he

03:05.285 --> 03:08.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said British security teams
checked Sharm el-Sheikh's
airport 10 months ago and would

03:08.422 --> 03:11.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be welcome to do so again.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, Egyptian
President (through translator):
I understand that the prime
minister

03:14.761 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to be assured of his
citizens' well-being. This is
his right. We're prepared to
cooperate

03:19.099 --> 03:23.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
further with any procedures that
reassure all our friends that
the security measures

03:23.737 --> 03:28.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in place at Sharm el-Sheikh
airport are enough and that the
airport is safe to a good
standard.

03:28.775 --> 03:33.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stepped-up
security screenings were in
evidence at the Red Sea resort's
airport

03:33.747 --> 03:38.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. Thousands of tourists
remained stranded there, after
Ireland, Germany and the
Netherlands

03:38.218 --> 03:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed Britain's lead and also
suspended their flights. Later,
British carriers Monarch

03:43.723 --> 03:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and EasyJet announced they will
begin evacuation flights to
Sharm el-Sheikh tomorrow with
official

03:48.795 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
approval to bring the
vacationers home. That process
could take up to 10 days.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington, President Obama
said U.S. officials are taking
-- quote -- "very seriously" the

03:58.772 --> 04:02.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possibility that a bomb
destroyed the Russian plane.

04:02.642 --> 04:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death toll from a factory
collapse in Pakistan rose to at
least 20 today. Some 200

04:08.615 --> 04:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers were believed to be
inside the four-story building
when it gave way overnight in
Lahore.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescuers painstakingly searched
the rubble for signs of
survivors and used heavy
machinery

04:16.990 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to clear debris. Some of those
trapped used cell phones to call
for help.

04:21.661 --> 04:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, 102 people have been
pulled out alive. Survivors say
cracks had appeared in the walls

04:26.500 --> 04:30.470 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
after a powerful
earthquake last week.

04:30.470 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The European Union made a
striking forecast today, that
another three million migrants

04:35.275 --> 04:40.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could arrive next year. That
came as an estimated 25,000
people waited on Lesbos and
other Greek

04:40.614 --> 04:44.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
islands, hoping a ferry
strike there will end.

04:44.751 --> 04:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lindsey Hilsum of Independent
Television News filed this
report from Lesbos.

04:48.488 --> 04:52.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: The Greek prime
minister and the president of
the European Parliament landed

04:52.859 --> 04:58.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Lesbos this morning and were
immediately confronted with the
reality of the situation.

04:58.198 --> 05:04.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SCHULZ, President,
European Parliament (through
translator): Just as we were
arriving

05:04.037 --> 05:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here with Mr. Tsipras, we saw
boats coming across the sea.
People were jumping into the

05:08.208 --> 05:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water and swimming to the beach.
We're truly facing a dramatic
situation here.

05:13.413 --> 05:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: They went to see
a so-called hot spot, where new
arrivals are supposed

05:18.084 --> 05:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be registered and sent on to
other wealthier E.U. countries.

05:22.722 --> 05:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister: The key issue is to
not encourage these people

05:26.326 --> 05:34.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take the boat of death and to
take the risk to lose their
lives in the Aegean Sea. And

05:34.568 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only way is to give the hope
that someday they will have the
chance to be in this mechanism

05:43.210 --> 05:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for resettlement directly from
the Turkish coast to Europe.

05:46.913 --> 05:53.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: Just a few yards
from the airport, we met the
Omira family from Damascus.

05:53.920 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sitting on the rocks in the
sunshine, they looked as if they
might be on holiday; 77-year-old

05:59.859 --> 06:06.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Omar is getting pretty
good at skimming stones.

06:06.399 --> 06:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hard to imagine what they were
going through night before last,
as a people smuggler crammed

06:10.070 --> 06:12.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them into a boat on
the Turkish coast.

06:12.839 --> 06:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMER OMIRA, Refugee: He told us
30 people only, then maybe 50
people, 70 people, I don't

06:19.412 --> 06:20.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LINDSEY HILSUM: So you
were really crowded?

06:24.484 --> 06:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMER OMIRA: Yes, yes, yes. We
told us -- no, it's very, very
dangerous. Then he brought

06:31.124 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the gun, and pow, pow. If you
don't believe me, we will -- a
gun.

06:36.696 --> 06:39.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LINDSEY HILSUM: So he
threatened to shoot you?

06:39.299 --> 06:41.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMER OMIRA: Yes, yes.

06:41.568 --> 06:45.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: Around the port,
we found hundreds of people
stranded because the ferry

06:45.839 --> 06:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operators have been on strike
since Monday, so there's no way
to get to Athens.

06:50.443 --> 06:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They sleep in tents or on the
streets. The people here are
hoping to get on the ferry

06:56.683 --> 07:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Athens tomorrow, when the
strike is over, but that's not
going to be an end to the
problem;

07:01.988 --> 07:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
5,000 or 6,000 refugees and
migrants are turning up on the
Greek islands every day still,
100,000

07:08.795 --> 07:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here in Lesbos just in
the last three weeks.

07:12.866 --> 07:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the background, Lesbos' own
Statue of Liberty, the brain
child of a local man who went to

07:18.938 --> 07:25.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York years ago. He can't
imagine that, 85 years on, the
huddled masses would come

07:25.345 --> 07:28.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his home island.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The United
Nations warned today that even
rough winter seas are not

07:31.551 --> 07:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
likely to stop the waves of
migrants trying to reach Greece.

07:36.056 --> 07:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. House overwhelmingly
approved a $325 billion highway
bill today. It maintains current

07:42.095 --> 07:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
levels of spending over six
years, amid concerns that aging
roads and bridges will need more

07:47.934 --> 07:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding. It also includes a
provision to reauthorize the
Export-Import Bank. The House
version

07:52.372 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
must be reconciled with the
Senate's highway bill.

07:55.942 --> 08:01.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. and 11 other countries
released the text of a sweeping
Pacific Rim trade deal

08:01.648 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, setting up a fight in
Congress. The Trans-Pacific
Partnership was negotiated for

08:05.985 --> 08:11.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than five years. The White
House says its eliminates some
18,000 taxes that other

08:11.291 --> 08:15.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
countries impose on U.S.
exports. It also contains
provisions to discourage forced
labor

08:15.061 --> 08:18.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and provide rights
to workers overseas.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the U.S. Capitol, the new
House speaker, Paul Ryan, said
lawmakers need time to digest

08:21.768 --> 08:24.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the thousands of pages.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: I'm pleased with
the process we have coming

08:26.639 --> 08:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before us, open, transparent.
People get to see it, members of
Congress get to see it,

08:32.379 --> 08:36.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and then we will decided
independently after consulting
with our constituents and our
conscience

08:36.316 --> 08:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what our position on anything
like a trade agreement will be.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
Democratic side, presidential
hopeful Hillary Clinton and
others

08:41.388 --> 08:44.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have already come out
against the deal.

08:44.958 --> 08:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reform Jewish movement in
the U.S. passed a far-reaching
resolution today in support

08:49.462 --> 08:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of transgender rights. Meeting
in Orlando, members of the Union
for Reform Judaism voted

08:54.567 --> 09:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for gender-neutral language and
bathrooms in their
congregations. The group has 1.5

09:00.840 --> 09:04.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million members. Other religious
bodies, including the Episcopal
Church and the United Church

09:04.778 --> 09:09.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Christ, have approved
transgender resolutions, but
none has gone as far as this
one.

09:09.682 --> 09:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street had a quiet day,
ahead of the October jobs report
being released tomorrow.

09:13.686 --> 09:17.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost four points to close at
17863. The Nasdaq fell

09:17.824 --> 09:22.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
14 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 dropped two.

09:22.862 --> 09:27.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the National Toy Hall of
Fame has announced its class of
2015. The new inductees include

09:27.901 --> 09:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the classic party game Twister,
which Sears initially deemed too
racy to advertise in

09:33.306 --> 09:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1966, the high-powered Super
Soaker water gun also made the
hall, along with the puppet,

09:39.112 --> 09:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a toy that goes back thousands
of years. The board game
Battleship came up short this
year.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So did Wiffle balls and
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

09:46.953 --> 09:51.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
rising tensions in the South
China Sea; upgrades to U.S.
nuclear

09:51.758 --> 09:56.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons; a new book reveals
President George H.W. Bush's
criticisms of his son's
administration,

09:56.329 --> 10:08.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

10:08.808 --> 10:13.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Naval activity by the United
States prompted another negative
reaction from Beijing today,

10:13.012 --> 10:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Pentagon Chief Ashton Carter
went on an unusual voyage with a
U.S. ally.

10:20.453 --> 10:25.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fighter pilots on the U.S.
Theodore Roosevelt went about
their business today. But this

10:25.158 --> 10:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, Defense Secretary Ash
Carter and his Malaysian
counterpart were on board
watching

10:29.295 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as the aircraft carrier
plied the South China Sea.

10:33.933 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ship and its escort group
were moving some 150 nautical
miles south of the Spratly

10:40.073 --> 10:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islands. They fall in a vast
area that's claimed by Beijing.
China also claims a 12-mile
territorial

10:47.146 --> 10:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zone around artificial islands
in the Spratlys, including
airstrips and other military
facilities.

10:52.886 --> 10:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A U.S. Navy destroyer challenged
that 12-mile zone last week.
Today, the Chinese Foreign

10:58.191 --> 11:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ministry again criticized
the American actions.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (through translator):
China

11:04.764 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has consistently respected all
countries' freedom of navigation
under international

11:09.702 --> 11:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law. What we oppose is waving
the banner of freedom of
navigation to push forward the

11:15.108 --> 11:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
militarization of the South
China Sea. We hope the relevant
actions and intentions of

11:19.312 --> 11:23.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. can be made more
open and transparent.

11:23.249 --> 11:27.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just
yesterday, defense ministers
from Southeast Asia ended a
meeting

11:27.220 --> 11:32.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Malaysia without issuing a
final statement. It was scrapped
after China objected to
mentioning

11:32.559 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sea dispute. Secretary
Carter was there.

11:36.396 --> 11:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: I reminded everyone
that the United States doesn't
take

11:40.133 --> 11:46.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sides in these maritime
disputes, but we do take the
side of peaceful resolution
under

11:46.372 --> 11:48.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
international law.

11:48.841 --> 11:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today, Carter
said his carrier visit is a
response to regional fears about

11:51.778 --> 11:54.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Chinese behavior.

11:54.814 --> 11:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called it -- quote -- "a sign
of the critical role the United
States' military power plays

11:58.184 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a very consequential region."

12:01.354 --> 12:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. officials say the Navy
means to continue challenging
the Chinese territorial claims,

12:06.392 --> 12:09.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a regular basis.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to help us
understand the United States'
recent activity in the South
China

12:12.999 --> 12:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sea and what it means is Bonnie
Glaser, director of the China
Power Project at the Center for

12:16.302 --> 12:19.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.

12:19.372 --> 12:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first, how big a deal is
this, if Ash Carter gets on a
very nice ship and decides

12:23.543 --> 12:27.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to take a cruise in
territorially disputed waters?

12:27.313 --> 12:30.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: Well, Secretary Carter
has done this

12:30.216 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
previously, when he attended the
Shangri-La dialogue in June of
this year.

12:34.854 --> 12:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was on a P-8 surveillance
aircraft flying over the Malacca
Straits. So it's not unusual

12:40.259 --> 12:45.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the United States secretary
of defense to be on a military
platform out in the South

12:45.365 --> 12:50.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China Sea demonstrating to the
region that the United States
has an abiding interest

12:50.103 --> 12:52.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in peace and stability
in the region.

12:52.872 --> 12:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it a
provocative act to be in this
specific place at this time?

12:57.110 --> 13:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: Undoubtedly, the
Chinese see it as a provocative
act, but I think that

13:00.513 --> 13:04.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the other nations in
the regions do not.

13:04.217 --> 13:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think if you look at Malaysia,
Vietnam, the Philippines, the
other claimants, they

13:10.356 --> 13:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are very happy to see the United
States' flag shown in the
region. They supported the
United

13:17.697 --> 13:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States exercising freedom of
navigation around what is called
Subi Reef, which is the
elevation,

13:23.569 --> 13:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the low-tide elevation that the
USS Lassen, a destroyer,
conducted a freedom of
navigation

13:30.309 --> 13:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operation just a few days ago.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is something that the
region supports generally.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The freedom of
navigation idea, is it a right
that sort of use it or

13:40.353 --> 13:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lose it? If you don't use it, is
that kind of what we're
stressing here by having carrier

13:43.589 --> 13:45.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
groups go through?

13:45.958 --> 13:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: The United States
has been doing this of course
for centuries. And since

13:49.595 --> 13:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1979, it has had a freedom
of navigation program.

13:55.268 --> 14:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, this is the
seventh what we call FONOP that
has been conducted since 2011

14:02.375 --> 14:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the South China Sea. And,
yes, I think if the Navy does
not sail through, and not

14:07.213 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just the U.S. Navy, but
Australia navy, Japan's navy
doesn't sail through waters that
are

14:14.721 --> 14:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high seas, that they are not
territorial seas of other
countries, even in territorial
seas,

14:18.591 --> 14:21.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we can sail through
making innocent passage.

14:21.828 --> 14:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, that is really
what we did in this case. We
sailed through a territorial

14:26.532 --> 14:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sea of China's Subi Reef. So,
yes, you have to exercise it or
other countries may claim

14:33.306 --> 14:36.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it and may try to
exclude other navies.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
other countries and their
claims, what have the other
countries

14:40.379 --> 14:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the region that have vested
interests in these waters, what
have they been doing, besides

14:45.051 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just China and the United States
that get kind of pinned in this
conversation?

14:48.521 --> 14:54.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BONNIE GLASER: Well, the
Philippines is trying to enhance
its capability to conduct what

14:54.594 --> 14:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we call better maritime domain
awareness, to know what's going
on inside its 200 nautical

14:59.198 --> 15:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mile exclusive economic zone.

15:02.034 --> 15:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in fact Japan and the United
States has been providing some
capability. The same is

15:07.073 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
true with Vietnam. And the
thinking here is that if other
claimants know what's going

15:12.011 --> 15:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on inside their waters, that the
Chinese will be less apt to use
coercion against them.

15:20.453 --> 15:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diplomatically, there's also
some steps being taken. The
Philippines has taken a very
important

15:25.057 --> 15:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case to the court under the U.N.
Convention of the Law of the
Sea, and there was just

15:31.130 --> 15:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an announcement today that the
merits of that case will be
heard at the end of November.

15:35.868 --> 15:39.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court has already found
jurisdiction on a number of the
counts.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, next year, there is going to
be likely a ruling that will
come down and that will

15:43.009 --> 15:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also have implications for the
behavior of China and other
countries going forward.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, does
China respect the decision of
that court?

15:50.116 --> 15:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: China has already
said that this court doesn't
have jurisdiction and it

15:54.086 --> 15:57.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has said that its finding will
be null and void, it will reject
it.

15:57.990 --> 16:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think that China cares
about its international
reputation, and so there is

16:03.029 --> 16:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a possibility that China will
reconsider that as we go
forward. I hope other countries
will

16:08.634 --> 16:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impose some more costs on China,
particularly in terms of its
coercive strategy in the region,

16:15.208 --> 16:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that we can convince the
Chinese that they're playing at
an ineffective game.

16:20.313 --> 16:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They should have good relations
with their neighbors, rather
than exert their sovereignty

16:25.218 --> 16:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claims over these rocks and
reefs in the South China Sea
that I think are less important

16:29.822 --> 16:32.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Chinese interests
over the long run.

16:32.525 --> 16:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How different
have China's actions been
compared to other people trying

16:36.395 --> 16:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stake a claim? We had video
of newly developed airstrips on
some of these islands and even

16:42.068 --> 16:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military armaments that are
really kind of ramping up.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: The Chinese do
see themselves as playing
catchup, because every other
claimant

16:50.943 --> 16:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the South China Sea, with the
exception of Brunei, has an
airstrip.

16:55.481 --> 17:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have all conducted a small
amount of land reclamation. That
is taking a land feature

17:01.821 --> 17:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and making it a little bit
bigger. The Chinese went in
there and dredged an enormous
amount

17:05.558 --> 17:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of sand and built these very
large artificial islands.

17:09.929 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So now the Chinese occupy the
largest land feature, which is
three times larger than

17:15.534 --> 17:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the largest natural-produced
island in the area. The Chinese,
the scope of what they

17:22.942 --> 17:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have done, and now they will
have four airstrips in the South
China Sea. Their capability
really

17:28.381 --> 17:31.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outstrips every other claimant.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Bonnie Glaser of the Center for
Strategic and International

17:33.452 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Studies in Washington, thanks
so much for joining us.

17:34.453 --> 17:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: Thank you.

17:40.293 --> 17:51.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: During the
Cold War, the United States
built tens of thousands of
nuclear

17:51.437 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons. Now that it's over and
with arms control treaties in
place, the arsenal has

17:55.074 --> 17:58.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shrunk significantly.

17:58.110 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Departments of Defense and
Energy say the remaining bombs
need to be rebuilt, but

18:03.249 --> 18:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
critics say those departments
are building new nuclear bombs
and spending too much money.

18:08.454 --> 18:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Veteran correspondent Jamie
McIntyre, now Al-Jazeera
America's national security
correspondent,

18:12.325 --> 18:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went on special assignment for
the "NewsHour" to examine the
claims.

18:16.429 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The story was produced in
partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting.

18:21.567 --> 18:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: At Eglin Air
Force Base, a solitary F-15
takes to the skies over the

18:28.207 --> 18:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swamps of Western Florida on a
mission that hearkens back to
the Cold War.

18:38.751 --> 18:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looks like any old-fashioned
gravity bomb as it falls to
earth. But what you're seeing

18:43.489 --> 18:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is one small part of an $8
billion project, the most
extensive and expensive
improvement

18:49.996 --> 18:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever to the B-61 nuclear bomb.
It's a nuclear test of sorts
without a mushroom cloud,
because

18:57.169 --> 19:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's being tried out is a new
guidance system to increase
accuracy.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The first test mission was
flown by pilot Jeff Searcy.

19:05.611 --> 19:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAJ. JEFF SEARCY, U.S. Air
Force: We are able to enter in
coordinates into our system and

19:10.649 --> 19:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then transfer those coordinates
into the weapon now. And the
weapon is built to be able to

19:15.121 --> 19:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guide to those coordinates.

19:17.356 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: This is a B-61 bomb, a
lightweight two-stage
thermonuclear weapon.

19:23.295 --> 19:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: The B-61 was
designed and first built in the
early 1960s. As this vintage

19:29.235 --> 19:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Air Force film shows, it lacked
any of today high-tech guidance
systems, relying on a parachute

19:33.706 --> 19:37.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to give the plane time
to escape the blast.

19:37.710 --> 19:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A half-century later, it's still
the mainstay of the Air Force's
nuclear arsenal, long overdue

19:43.282 --> 19:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for an overhaul, argues Major
General Garrett Harencak.

19:46.752 --> 19:51.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. GARRETT HARENCAK, U.S.
Air Force: These components age,
just like any component

19:51.157 --> 19:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would in an automobile or in an
appliance, and it has certain
aspects of it that just

19:57.163 --> 19:59.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to be modernized.

19:59.732 --> 20:05.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: The "PBS
NewsHour" was given exclusive
and unprecedented access to the

20:05.805 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
labs and facilities across the
country involved in the
multibillion-dollar makeover,
such

20:11.310 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the National Security Campus
in Kansas City, where crash
tests help determine the

20:14.780 --> 20:21.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
durability of key components.

20:21.554 --> 20:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The B-61 is just one program in
a $100 billion effort dubbed
stockpile stewardship, an
ambitious

20:28.861 --> 20:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan that includes modernizing
America's remaining arsenal of
1,500 nuclear bombs and
warheads.

20:35.768 --> 20:40.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At Sandia National Laboratory in
New Mexico, senior engineer Brad
Boswell showed me the

20:40.239 --> 20:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obsolete analog innards of the
old 1960s version of the bomb.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one of the things that was
surprising to me was that we
still have nuclear weapons

20:49.615 --> 20:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using vacuum tubes, like the
ones we had in our old TVs.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRAD BOSWELL, Sandia National
Laboratories: That is correct.

20:54.887 --> 21:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: And so this kind
vacuum tube is now part of this
printed circuit board?

21:01.494 --> 21:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD BOSWELL: That is correct.
As you look at this printed
circuit board, vacuum tubes

21:04.797 --> 21:09.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this are replaced by the
smaller, commonly used
electronic, discrete components
that

21:09.568 --> 21:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you see on these boards today.

21:12.037 --> 21:16.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: While many of
the components of the B-61 are
being upgraded and modernized,

21:16.709 --> 21:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the big change is the addition
of this tail fin kit, which
allows the bomb to be guided

21:21.780 --> 21:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to its target, a big improvement
over the old system that
deployed a parachute, which

21:25.851 --> 21:29.155 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
floated the bomb
down to the ground.

21:29.155 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It won't make the bomb as
precise as a GPS-guided smart
bomb, but it will increase its
accuracy.

21:36.061 --> 21:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You might think that with all
their destructive power, nuclear
weapons wouldn't need to hit

21:41.300 --> 21:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a target dead center. But the
B-61 has a feature dubbed
dial-a-yield, which allows its
explosive

21:47.840 --> 21:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force to be reduced. And when
combined with better accuracy,
that results in a weapon

21:53.112 --> 21:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war-fighters might actually be
tempted to use on the
battlefield.

21:57.449 --> 22:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In his Washington office, Hans
Kristensen, with the Federation
of American Scientists,

22:01.453 --> 22:04.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
called up a Web site
to show me an example.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANS KRISTENSEN, Federation of
American Scientists: Here you
have, the White House itself is
gone,

22:07.459 --> 22:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so is much of the downtown
area, but a much smaller radius.

22:12.064 --> 22:17.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Smaller blast
area, less radiation, fewer
casualties, all add up to a more
palatable

22:17.836 --> 22:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last-resort option, argues
Kristensen, making the B-61 less
deadly, but, perversely, more

22:22.975 --> 22:24.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dangerous.

22:24.977 --> 22:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANS KRISTENSEN: It's more
likely that a military commander
will go to the president with
this

22:28.914 --> 22:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapon and say, Mr. President,
all our other options are out of
the question, but we have

22:33.052 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good one here that doesn't
pollute a whole lot.

22:36.455 --> 22:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: It's one thing
for an arms control advocates to
make that case, but another

22:40.125 --> 22:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when the former top commander of
America's nuclear forces to
agree.

22:45.631 --> 22:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Retired Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs Marine General
James Cartwright supports the

22:49.268 --> 22:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
B-61 upgrade, but can see how it
could change the calculus in a
crisis.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. JAMES CARTWRIGHT (RET.),
Former Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs: If I can drive

22:56.108 --> 23:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the yield, drive down,
therefore, the likelihood of
fallout, et cetera, does that

23:01.714 --> 23:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make it more usable in the eyes
of some -- some president or
national security
decision-making

23:08.053 --> 23:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process? And the answer is, it
likely could be more usable.

23:13.859 --> 23:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: The Pentagon
argues making nuclear weapons
more usable makes them a more

23:18.731 --> 23:23.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
realistic threat, thereby
increasing their deterrent value
and decreasing the risk of

23:23.068 --> 23:26.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
miscalculation.

23:26.272 --> 23:30.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Cook is a deputy
administrator at the National
Nuclear Security Administration,

23:30.142 --> 23:32.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is overseeing
the B-61 project:

23:32.645 --> 23:35.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD COOK, Deputy
Administrator, National Nuclear
Security Administration: If we
have

23:35.180 --> 23:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a weapon that is lower-yield and
greater accuracy, and our
adversaries know that, it's my
own

23:42.054 --> 23:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
belief that that weapon then is
a more effective deterrent and
is, therefore, less likely to

23:48.227 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ever be used in anger.

23:50.829 --> 23:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: The Pentagon is
careful to portray the new B-61
as basically the same

23:56.235 --> 24:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
old bomb with just a few more
modern parts. That's a key
point, since the Obama
administration

24:01.307 --> 24:05.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had pledged not to build
new nuclear weapons.

24:05.878 --> 24:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But officials also stress
they're making the bomb safer
and more reliable. At Los Alamos

24:11.884 --> 24:16.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Laboratory, engineers
are testing a new high-explosive
material that's used

24:16.855 --> 24:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to trigger the nuclear chain
reaction in the B-61 warhead.
It's called insensitive high

24:26.131 --> 24:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explosive, insensitive because
it's really hard to detonate,
just what you want in a

24:29.268 --> 24:32.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear warhead.

24:32.638 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The standard for nuclear weapons
is always/never, as in, they
must always work when they
should,

24:39.745 --> 24:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and never when they shouldn't.
Critics of the B-61 say they
have no objection to making

24:45.017 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear weapons safer, but they
allege the Energy Department
labs that rebuild the weapons

24:49.922 --> 24:53.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have a financial motive,
lobbying Congress, sometimes
with government money, to
approve

24:53.726 --> 24:56.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lucrative contracts.

Jay Coghlan is with Nuclear
Watch New Mexico, an
anti-nuclear watchdog group.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY COGHLAN, Nuclear Watch New
Mexico: The American taxpayers
should know that the directors

25:06.538 --> 25:11.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of these nuclear weapons
laboratories that are pushing
these extreme proposals actually

25:11.143 --> 25:15.180 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have an inherent
conflict of interests.

25:15.180 --> 25:20.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're both the lab directors,
but at the same time they're the
presidents of corporations

25:20.619 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running the labs. It's in their
interests and their bottom line
to be able to have these

25:25.891 --> 25:28.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
life extension programs.

25:28.761 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: At Sandia,
deputy laboratory director Steve
Rottler said his people believe

25:33.432 --> 25:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are performing a vital
national security function.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE ROTTLER, Sandia National
Laboratories: We very much view
what we're doing as a public

25:39.471 --> 25:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service. We approach it with
objectivity. We approach it with
the sober understanding

25:44.042 --> 25:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what we're doing and the
impact of what that could mean
if these weapons were ever

25:47.045 --> 25:48.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
used.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Critics like to
point out the estimated $20
million price tag for a

25:52.618 --> 25:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
single retooled B-61 is more
than if the 700-pound bomb were
made out of solid gold. And they

25:59.324 --> 26:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argue the billions could be
better spent on more
conventional arms, weapons that
will

26:02.394 --> 26:06.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be used every day.

26:06.432 --> 26:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That argument rankles Air Force
General Harencak, who says
deterring potential adversaries
is

26:10.035 --> 26:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a real return on investment.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. GARRETT HARENCAK:
Eight-point-one billion dollars
is a lot of money, but what

26:15.974 --> 26:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can't do is just take the
number of missiles and divide it
by 8.1 and say, OK, this is

26:20.646 --> 26:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cost. This is a weapon that
is going to be used every single
day in a deterrent mission.

26:27.653 --> 26:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when you add that over 40
years, find out, I think you
come to the realization that

26:31.523 --> 26:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's a pretty good bargain
for the American people.

26:34.226 --> 26:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: The cost of the
program has already doubled once
from the initial estimate,

26:38.831 --> 26:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and one internal Pentagon review
back in 2012 suggested the final
cost could end up higher.

26:45.037 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever the price tag, the B-61
will be the Pentagon's most
expensive bomb project ever.

But, first, it's been more than
a year since actor and comedian
Robin Williams died. But

27:39.658 --> 27:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new details shared this week by
his widow are calling attention
to a form of dementia

27:43.795 --> 27:46.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has received little
public focus until now.

27:46.632 --> 27:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

27:49.234 --> 27:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After Robin
Williams took his own life, his
press representative said

27:53.005 --> 27:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Williams was battling severe
depression. His widow, Susan
Schneider Williams, also said

27:57.142 --> 28:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back then that he was struggling
with depression and early stages
of Parkinson's disease

28:01.780 --> 28:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this week, Mrs. Williams
told ABC News and "People"
magazine that an autopsy
revealed

28:06.051 --> 28:11.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something else. He had what is
known as Lewy body dementia. She
described battling a mysterious

28:11.890 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
set of symptoms for a year,
something she compared to
playing Whac-A-Mole -- quote --
"They

28:16.662 --> 28:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
present themselves like a
pinball machine," she said. "You
don't know exactly what you're

28:20.165 --> 28:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at. I have spent this
last year trying to find out
what killed Robin, because we

28:23.769 --> 28:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't know. He didn't know."

28:27.105 --> 28:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now to help us
understand more about this
disease is neurologist Dr. James

28:30.976 --> 28:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Galvin. He's a professor and
associate dean for clinical
research at Florida Atlantic

28:33.745 --> 28:34.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

28:34.947 --> 28:39.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Galvin, thank
you for joining us.

28:39.952 --> 28:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems that before this news
about Robin Williams broke, most
of us had never heard

28:43.855 --> 28:46.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this disease. Can you tell
me a little bit more about it?

28:46.391 --> 28:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN, Florida
Atlantic University: Sure.

28:49.261 --> 28:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lewy body dementia may be
the most common disease you have
never heard of. It's the

28:54.199 --> 28:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second most common cause of
memory problems after
Alzheimer's disease and affects
over

28:59.271 --> 29:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1.3 million Americans. Its
predominant symptoms are a
progressive change in memory and
other

29:05.877 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thinking functions, signs of
Parkinson's, so, slow movement,
stiffness, balance problems,

29:12.884 --> 29:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visual hallucinations, seeing
things that aren't there, like
little people or furry

29:17.923 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little animals, fluctuations in
levels of attention,
concentration, and, lastly, a
sleep

29:25.063 --> 29:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disorder where people
act out their dreams.

29:28.033 --> 29:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Among that
huge array of symptoms, I'm
curious about the particular

29:33.171 --> 29:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visual hallucinations you
described. Is that common for a
certain type of dementia to have

29:36.975 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
such specific hallucinations?

29:39.244 --> 29:44.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN: It's very
common in Lewy body dementia.

29:44.049 --> 29:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Typically, if other dementias,
other memory problems develop
hallucinations, they're not

29:49.154 --> 29:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until much later in the course
of the disease, and the
hallucinations are not so
well-formed.

29:54.459 --> 30:00.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What's particularly
characteristic of Lewy body
dementia are these very
well-formed hallucinations.

30:00.432 --> 30:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're usually not frightening
initially to the patient, but
they are very well-formed.

30:04.403 --> 30:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They usually can describe
exactly what they're seeing.

30:07.673 --> 30:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Is it partially
because -- it sounds like the
symptoms seem to mimic
Alzheimer's

30:13.111 --> 30:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other diseases. Is that why
this is such a difficult to
diagnose?

30:16.515 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. JAMES GALVIN:
That's exactly why.

30:20.452 --> 30:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early on, some of the symptoms
may mimic other diseases, like
Alzheimer's if it's just the

30:25.057 --> 30:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
memory problems, Parkinson's
disease, if it's the movement
problems, or a psychiatric
disease

30:29.394 --> 30:33.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like schizophrenia if
it's the hallucinations.

30:33.031 --> 30:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really takes an experienced
clinician to be able to be able
to put all the pieces together

30:36.868 --> 30:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and come up with the diagnosis.

30:39.438 --> 30:43.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, is this a
degenerative disease? And is
there any cure? Does it just

30:43.542 --> 30:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get worse, or is there any
prognosis that is a hopeful one?

30:47.012 --> 30:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN: Well, it is a
progressive degenerative
disease, and we do not have a

30:49.715 --> 30:53.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cure for it yet.

30:53.085 --> 30:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can effectively treat many of
the symptoms of the disease
using medicines for other
diseases.

30:58.090 --> 31:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, we can use the
medicines that are used in
Alzheimer's disease and
Parkinson's

31:02.828 --> 31:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disease and schizophrenia to
treat the individual symptoms,
but I think it takes a very
careful,

31:08.567 --> 31:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individualized approach to
decide which is the best regimen
of medicines for each patient.

31:13.371 --> 31:18.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Robin
Williams' widow described
battling these symptoms as akin
to playing

31:18.510 --> 31:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the game Whac-A-Mole. Is that
similar to what you have heard
from other parents, that it's

31:22.180 --> 31:26.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this very mysterious, hard thing
to pin down, you just don't know
what's coming at you?

31:26.518 --> 31:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN: It can be very
mysterious and very difficult
and challenging for the

31:30.689 --> 31:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patients and the families and
for the clinicians, frankly.

31:35.427 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the symptoms begin to appear,
it really takes a while to kind
of sort out what is

31:40.432 --> 31:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on. With the Lewy Body
Dementia Association, we had
conducted a survey over 950
caregivers

31:46.605 --> 31:52.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to try to understand the
diagnostic experience. And what
we found was up to an 18-month
delay,

31:52.277 --> 31:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with patients seeing multiple
doctors over multiple visits,
before finally getting a

31:55.280 --> 31:57.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
correct diagnosis.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand
that there is some question
about whether people who

32:01.686 --> 32:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suffer from Lewy body dementia
might be more at risk to harm
themselves or to commit suicide.

32:07.325 --> 32:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell me a little bit
about that? Why would that be
and is that true?

32:11.196 --> 32:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN: Well, there's
no evidence that any of the
dementias, Lewy body dementia

32:16.001 --> 32:19.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or Alzheimer's disease, for that
matter, by themselves increase
the risk of people committing

32:19.638 --> 32:22.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suicide.

32:22.541 --> 32:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, for some individuals, when
they hear they have a chronic
disease and they're trying

32:27.045 --> 32:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deal with a chronic disease,
and maybe the diagnosis isn't
given or isn't correct

32:31.850 --> 32:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the time, and their symptoms
aren't responding, people can
make decisions to harm
themselves.

32:36.855 --> 32:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the disease itself is not
associated with a higher risk of
suicide.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I see.

32:42.427 --> 32:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, looking forward, I mean, is
there any optimism that we're at
the cusp of a treatment

32:46.765 --> 32:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for this type of a disease?

32:49.401 --> 32:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN: Well, I think
there is great room for
optimism. We know more and more
about

32:54.172 --> 32:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the disease. We understand more
and more about the abnormal
proteins that aggregate or clump

32:58.777 --> 33:03.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
together, that cause the
changes in the brain.

33:03.014 --> 33:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so now this is beginning to
allow us to develop medications
that may have some effect.

33:07.919 --> 33:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very recently, several companies
have made announcements that
they're beginning specific

33:12.257 --> 33:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinical trials to treat Lewy
body dementia. And these would
be the first medicines
specifically

33:15.594 --> 33:19.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
indicated for treating
Lewy body diseases.

33:19.631 --> 33:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think there is great
optimism. I think it's important
that patients remain hopeful

33:25.403 --> 33:29.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and families remain hopeful and
stay engaged and advocate for
their loved ones, so that

33:29.040 --> 33:32.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can get more research funding
to develop new treatments.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Dr.
James Galvin of Florida Atlantic
University, thank you

33:34.246 --> 33:35.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

33:35.280 --> 33:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. JAMES GALVIN: Thank you.

HARI SREENIVASAN: The latest
jobs report is due out tomorrow,
and, once again, it's expected

33:54.933 --> 33:58.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to show a large percentage of
people who are now
self-employed.

33:58.703 --> 34:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A New York-based start-up has
come up with a new business
model that rents office and

34:03.508 --> 34:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work spaces to freelancers and
others. And it's growing. The
company announced a new

34:08.213 --> 34:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
round of fund-raising this week
as it opens more locations
around the country, as well

34:11.349 --> 34:14.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as in England, Israel
and the Netherlands.

34:14.619 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the company's premise also
raises some fundamental
questions about the
transformation

34:17.789 --> 34:20.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the workplace.

McKelvey in 2010.

35:51.583 --> 35:57.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thinking was that, given the
swelling ranks of the
self-employed, why not lease

35:57.222 --> 36:03.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and then spiff up empty
buildings, subdivide the space
and sublet it, in units as small

36:03.495 --> 36:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as one desk, while providing

RICHARD GREENWALD: I'm
hard-pressed to see a sector of
the economy where outsourcing

37:12.464 --> 37:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't having a huge impact. And
I think for many Americans, they
think of it as a temporary

37:20.305 --> 37:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing. Eventually, people are
going to have to recognize that
this is not an in-between

37:23.408 --> 37:25.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stage. This is the new normal.

37:25.777 --> 37:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But to Greenwald,
the insecurity of contingent
work without benefits isn't

37:30.849 --> 37:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normal at all. The premise of
WeWork, however, is that if
outsourcing is inexorable, at
least

37:37.122 --> 37:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the outsourced have a cool and
convenient place to set up shop.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Anastasia Morozova does
marketing for a start-up real
estate firm. Why doesn't she
telecommute

37:46.297 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for free from home
or at Starbucks?

37:49.601 --> 37:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANASTASIA MOROZOVA, Curzon Real
Estate: Too many distractions.
One could say that there

37:52.470 --> 37:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are distractions in a space like
this, but they're the good kind.
It's everyone working.

37:56.674 --> 38:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's coffee and spa water on
draft, beer after 5:00. It's a
good space to feel energetic

38:02.147 --> 38:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and inspired to get work done.

38:06.584 --> 38:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Am I being too
negative to think that what
you're doing is providing
community

38:11.689 --> 38:18.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people who would otherwise
be lonely, as opposed to
inspiring people and giving

38:18.663 --> 38:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them meaning, whereas they
couldn't come up with meaning on
their own?

38:23.735 --> 38:30.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIGUEL MCKELVEY: Well,
certainly, there's components of
both of those things, but as

38:30.975 --> 38:38.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an entrepreneur who had spent
time working at home, I could
have all the ideas in my

38:38.750 --> 38:43.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head, and they could all be
incredibly genius, amazing
things that inspired me all day.
But

38:43.588 --> 38:46.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
without someone to share
that with, where does it go?

38:46.824 --> 38:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, WeWork chose
spaces to maximize mingling.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIGUEL MCKELVEY: Most of our
buildings are on corners. We
choose buildings that have

38:53.765 --> 38:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
great daylight, because that
makes people feel good.

38:57.702 --> 39:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And then McKelvey
designed the spaces to further
spur interaction.

39:01.606 --> 39:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIGUEL MCKELVEY: At the expense
of convenience, we will
sometimes make, you know, people
walk

39:07.712 --> 39:12.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
further, make people walk
through a space in order to just
potentially have the opportunity

39:12.617 --> 39:17.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to see more people doing
different things. Maybe there is
someone doing a whiskey tasting

39:17.655 --> 39:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over there or there is a cold
brew thing here or there is
someone presenting on the screen

39:22.193 --> 39:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over there. Maybe I will take a
minute and go check that out.

39:25.730 --> 39:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And so glass-walled
offices, festooned with funky
furniture, the inevitable

39:31.069 --> 39:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ping-pong table, fussball, a
quiet room when it all becomes a
bit much, free coffee all

39:37.642 --> 39:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day, of course, and beer on tap
at beer hour, which kicks off at
5:00 p.m.

39:42.981 --> 39:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the coffee is to keep people
working hard and to stay awake,
but the alcohol is to...

39:48.653 --> 39:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGUEL MCKELVEY: Lubricate.

39:49.153 --> 39:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To lubricate.

39:49.454 --> 39:50.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:50.188 --> 39:51.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIGUEL MCKELVEY: Yes.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.391 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: To
lubricate community?

39:53.391 --> 39:56.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIGUEL MCKELVEY: Yes.

39:56.160 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: WeWork isn't the
only firm housing the
self-employed these days. Not
long ago,

40:02.166 --> 40:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I flailed away against real
estate developer Ashish Dua of
Acumen Capital, which buys and

40:08.606 --> 40:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refurbishes manufacturing
buildings, like this former
Pfizer pharmaceutical plant in

40:12.510 --> 40:14.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brooklyn.

40:14.779 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It now houses a host of
artisanal food vendors, a maker
of handmade dog leashes. But
WeWork

40:22.887 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targets office workers. And it's
a phenomenon, growing
exponentially, 56 locations in
17

40:30.428 --> 40:34.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cities as disparate as London
and Tel Aviv. The company added
two more sites just during

40:34.565 --> 40:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the week we were shooting.

40:37.201 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company was valued earlier
this year at $5 billion. But
within six months, the valuation

40:43.775 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doubled to $10 billion. As
"Bloomberg" magazine points out,
however, you could build and own

40:50.581 --> 40:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the World Trade Center building,
with three million square feet
of office space, almost

40:55.953 --> 41:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as many square feet as WeWork
temporarily leases, for only $4
billion. WeWork owns no

41:01.893 --> 41:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
space of its own and took out
leases when rents were cheap.

41:06.998 --> 41:12.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens to its costs when
it has to renew in a hot rental
market? What about just
collecting

41:12.603 --> 41:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rent, given the fact that
most start-ups fail? In other
words, a contingent work force

41:18.910 --> 41:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could be a problem for WeWork,
and perhaps, says Professor
Greenwald, for us all.

41:23.948 --> 41:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD GREENWALD: If we're
moving to this entrepreneurial
utopia, where everyone's their

41:28.052 --> 41:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own boss, those who are lucky
can be successful and march up
the chain. But most of America

41:34.625 --> 41:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not going to be, and that's
what I'm troubled by, as this
pattern continues.

41:39.464 --> 41:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, for the
moment, WeWork tenants like Lily
Brynes embrace the new freelance

41:43.901 --> 41:46.170 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

41:46.170 --> 41:52.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you feel vulnerable being a
member of the contingent work
force? That is, you're a
freelancer.

41:52.543 --> 41:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LILY BRYNES: I don't necessarily
feel vulnerable. If anything, I
just try to capitalize on being

41:57.715 --> 42:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around all of these other
freelancers, because my business
is all edible marketing. And
when

42:02.587 --> 42:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are in an environment full
of companies and people looking
to gift people with unique

42:07.125 --> 42:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- unique things like this, it
just always works in my
advantage.

42:10.528 --> 42:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, what's next for
McKelvey and his team at WeWork?
This building in Arlington,

42:16.200 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Virginia is being repurposed for
micro-apartments, 360 square
feet or less, with common
kitchens

42:23.674 --> 42:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and living space, branded as
WeLive, and a brand-new WeWork
space will be in the same

42:29.814 --> 42:34.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
building, a lot like
a college dorm.

42:34.452 --> 42:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New York, New York, this is
economics correspondent Paul
Solman, still with a full-time
job, reporting

42:38.756 --> 42:47.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the "PBS NewsHour."

42:47.665 --> 42:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Biographies
don't always make news, but a
new book on George H.W. Bush

42:57.475 --> 43:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is garnering headlines across
the country today for how Bush
41 felt about his son's

43:02.880 --> 43:07.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
response to the 9/11 attacks and
subsequent invasion of Iraq,
among other things.

43:07.985 --> 43:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The book will not be published
until next week, but we have an
early look. For "Destiny

43:13.591 --> 43:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Power: The American Odyssey
of George Herbert Walker Bush,"
Jon Meacham, the executive

43:18.062 --> 43:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
editor at Random House, relied
not only on extensive interviews
of the president's family,

43:22.667 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staff, and friends, but also on
the nearly daily audio diaries
the president recorded

43:26.704 --> 43:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while in the White House.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy Woodruff talked with him
earlier this week for the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

43:32.243 --> 43:34.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jon
Meacham, welcome.

43:34.545 --> 43:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM, Author, "Destiny
and Power: The American Odyssey
of George Herbert Walker

43:34.312 --> 43:36.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bush": Thank you, Judy.

43:36.180 --> 43:42.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You had
extraordinary, maybe
unprecedented access to this
president, all

43:42.053 --> 43:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his diaries, Barbara Bush's
diaries, the ability to
interview almost everybody in
the

43:46.257 --> 43:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family. Why do you think they
trusted you with all this?

43:49.160 --> 43:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Well, I hope they
felt that I would call it like I
saw it, which was the

43:52.497 --> 43:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of the mandate
from the president.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A life of
privilege. I mean, he certainly
grew up in this family involved

43:59.637 --> 44:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in politics, great wealth, but
he also had a sense of
responsibility from a very early

44:04.108 --> 44:06.811 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
age. What do you
think shaped him?

44:06.811 --> 44:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Well, you know, he
comes out of the same world of
noblesse oblige that

44:11.249 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shaped Theodore Roosevelt and
Franklin Roosevelt, and,
frankly, some of the founding
fathers.

44:15.152 --> 44:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could argue that, culturally
and temperamentally, George H.W.
Bush has more in common with the

44:21.125 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
founders than he does with his
successors generationally, in
terms of their life experience.

44:26.264 --> 44:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, his mother was hugely
important. She was very
religious and very competitive

44:31.769 --> 44:35.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in equal parts, I think,
it's safe to say.

44:35.273 --> 44:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he believed in the doctrine,
to whom much is given, much is
expected. What's really

44:41.045 --> 44:45.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interesting, I think -- and I
hadn't realized this until I got
into Mrs. Bush's diary -- is

44:45.249 --> 44:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there was an expectation,
there was a sense that he could
be president, that that

44:49.921 --> 44:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possibility was within the realm
of the probable, as early as the
1950s.

44:55.760 --> 45:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You -- there's so
much about him and his
relationship, of course, with

45:00.731 --> 45:04.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his family, with Ronald Reagan,
who -- he was vice president to
Reagan for eight years.

45:04.535 --> 45:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, of course, his son went on
to be president for eight years.

45:09.140 --> 45:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he was very different from
them. And this touches on what
you said a minute ago. I mean,

45:12.643 --> 45:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his view of politics was more of
a pragmatic, rather than an
ideological...

45:16.347 --> 45:18.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

45:18.149 --> 45:20.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Labels are for cans,
he used to say.

45:20.818 --> 45:22.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:22.720 --> 45:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: And, you know, you
look at where we are now, and he
was part of this for a

45:27.558 --> 45:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
half-century. Mrs. Bush said in
1963, right before he first ran
for the Senate in 1964,

45:33.698 --> 45:37.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the nuts will
never love him.

45:37.268 --> 45:41.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were talking about the
John Birch Society back then.
The Republican base was

45:41.038 --> 45:47.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always wary of George H.W. Bush.
In 1980, he called Reaganomics
voodoo economics.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

45:50.047 --> 45:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: In 1988, he lost
Iowa. You know, the party had
always -- the conservative part

45:53.951 --> 45:56.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the party had always
been uneasy with him.

45:56.854 --> 46:01.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he was the
one, after saying during the
campaign, "Read my lips, no new

46:01.959 --> 46:04.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taxes," he went on to be elected
president, but when he saw the
budget deficit was out

46:04.662 --> 46:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of control, he raised taxes.

46:05.997 --> 46:08.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: Right.

46:08.132 --> 46:12.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Dukakis told me a great
story, that, when they met after
the election, Bush said,

46:12.870 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Well, I won't be able to raise
taxes in the first year." And
Dukakis thought: "In the

46:16.841 --> 46:20.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first year? I just lost to this
guy saying he'd never raise
taxes."

46:20.411 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was
interesting. You talked to him,
of course, about what happened
in

46:23.114 --> 46:28.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his presidency and how he was
devastated by the loss. I mean,
he thought, I guess
understandably,

46:28.986 --> 46:31.088 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that this was a
reflection of him.

46:31.088 --> 46:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: He thought he
was a failed president.

46:35.126 --> 46:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I open the book on election
night 1992, and I would argue
that, in many ways, the 20th

46:40.431 --> 46:45.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
century ended on November 3,
1992, when Bill Clinton, the
first baby boomer president,

46:45.936 --> 46:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defeats George H.W. Bush, the
last World War II president.

46:50.541 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Bush really just doesn't
quite get it, not in the sense
that we all remember he was

46:55.579 --> 46:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of -- seemed out of touch
about the economy. That is not
-- that's not true. In fact, he

46:59.517 --> 47:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knew the economy was going to
be a hugely important issue.

47:03.354 --> 47:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he says to his tape-recorded
diary, by himself, sitting in
the Houstonian Hotel:

47:09.093 --> 47:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Duty, honor, country, I always
thought that's what Americans
were made of, but, quite
plainly,

47:12.797 --> 47:15.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's not."

47:15.199 --> 47:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was just subsumed with
anguish that he had not been
able to finish the job.

47:22.039 --> 47:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I do want to ask
you, Jon Meacham, about what he
says about his son, President

47:26.177 --> 47:30.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bush 43, President
George W. Bush.

47:30.781 --> 47:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's very supportive, loves his
son. But you get him to talk
about how he was really
uncomfortable

47:38.155 --> 47:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with what he called too much
hawkishness. He didn't like the
-- he didn't like the axis

47:40.858 --> 47:43.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of evil.

47:43.127 --> 47:46.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Right. He said,
"Historically, I don't think
that will be -- will benefit

47:46.063 --> 47:48.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anything."

47:48.599 --> 47:53.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't like the swaggering
rhetoric of his son's
administration.

47:53.437 --> 47:55.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then
the Dick Cheney...

47:55.706 --> 47:57.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: Right.

47:57.475 --> 48:02.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, who he
-- turns out he felt was -- had
too much influence in his

48:02.913 --> 48:05.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
son's administration.

48:05.182 --> 48:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: George H.W. Bush
said that he believed that
Cheney was responsible for a

48:10.688 --> 48:17.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
good bit of that hawkish image,
and that he wished that Cheney
had not had as much influence,

48:17.461 --> 48:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he -- that Dick Cheney
should have had his -- quote --
"own State Department," and

48:21.198 --> 48:24.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that vice presidents
shouldn't do that.

48:24.135 --> 48:29.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When I took that to Vice
President Cheney, he read it and
said, "Fascinating."

48:29.006 --> 48:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when you took
it to President Bush 43, George
W. Bush, what did he say?

48:36.180 --> 48:40.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: Well, he said that
he had never -- his father had
never said that to him.

48:40.351 --> 48:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it would have been out
of character for his father to
say, "Hey, you have got

48:44.155 --> 48:48.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to rein in Cheney, he's ruining
your administration, that that
conversation never took place.

48:48.425 --> 48:52.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He was publicly
supportive of going into Iraq,
the decision to invade

48:52.396 --> 48:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraq in 2003, but he clearly
had misgivings about it.

48:56.967 --> 49:01.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: He had what a
friend called anxieties. He was
anxious about it.

49:01.438 --> 49:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also privately wrote his son
a note, saying that if the man
won't comply, meaning Saddam,

49:06.944 --> 49:12.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you have to do what you
have to do. And one of the
things about that I think
historically

49:12.516 --> 49:19.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is important is, George H.W.
Bush had his own war with
Saddam, in which he was quite

49:19.456 --> 49:24.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unilateral. He was willing --
one of the things that emerges
in the president's diary is
that,

49:24.028 --> 49:27.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on five or six different
occasions, he talks about how he
would be willing to be
impeached,

49:27.598 --> 49:32.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, even if the Congress said
in 1990-'91, we're not
authorizing the use of force, he

49:32.703 --> 49:35.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was willing to go.

49:35.472 --> 49:39.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first Bush to talk about
Saddam in terms of good vs. evil
wasn't George W. Bush...

49:39.243 --> 49:39.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

49:39.844 --> 49:40.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: ... but Bush 41.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Was -- was
this -- was the father.

49:42.346 --> 49:44.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: Right.

49:44.048 --> 49:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet he went
on to have, as you said,
anxieties about what his son

49:47.051 --> 49:49.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did after 9/11.

49:49.720 --> 49:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: One of the key
things about Bush 41 is the
sense of deference to whomever
the

49:54.225 --> 49:57.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president happens to
be at a given moment.

49:57.862 --> 50:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He believed that his son was
confronting something that no
president since Lincoln had
done,

50:01.799 --> 50:05.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which was warfare
on American soil.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have
talked to him a lot since he
left office, which was, what,

50:08.672 --> 50:09.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
23 years ago.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JON MEACHAM: Yes.

50:11.876 --> 50:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does he say
about the hyper-partisanship in
Washington now?

50:16.247 --> 50:21.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: It worries him
enormously, because he -- and he
saw it happen as he was
governing.

50:21.518 --> 50:24.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happened right around him.

50:24.455 --> 50:29.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the rise of Gingrich,
the rise of freelance
partisanship happened when he
was

50:29.593 --> 50:32.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
willing to take the political
heat, break the "Read my lips"
pledge, do what he thought

50:32.863 --> 50:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was best for the country.

50:35.065 --> 50:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one of the key things
about George Bush, is, no matter
how you feel about how

50:41.205 --> 50:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he campaigned -- and he was a
tough campaigner -- in fact, he
talks in his diary about, "I'm

50:46.210 --> 50:50.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stronger, I'm tougher. If I had
kept letting the press define me
as a wimp or a loser,

50:50.881 --> 50:55.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't be here,
almost winning in 1988."

50:55.586 --> 51:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But once he was in office, he
tried to put the country first,
and he acted against his

51:03.961 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own political interest. The
great example is the 1990 budget
deal. He had run against

51:09.667 --> 51:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raising taxes. He got into it.
He saw he needed to, so he did
that. And he knew at the time

51:14.405 --> 51:16.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it could cost
him reelection.

51:16.607 --> 51:21.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said to me,
just finally, a moment ago this
may be the last time a president

51:21.545 --> 51:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gives this kind of access while
he or she is still alive.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JON MEACHAM: It's possible.

51:27.885 --> 51:35.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- these kind of diaries
are unique. He kept audio
diaries throughout his --
episodically

51:35.259 --> 51:39.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as vice president, and then
fairly regularly as president.
There are all sorts of legal

51:39.863 --> 51:44.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues with that and
who listens to them.

51:44.535 --> 51:50.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is as close as many of
us, I think, are going to get to
actually sitting in the

51:50.507 --> 51:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oval Office. This is him talking
at moments of great triumph, at
moments of tragedy. It's

51:58.015 --> 52:04.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a remarkable historical
document, his presidential
diary, because it's as high
politics really

52:04.722 --> 52:09.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is, but we so rarely get
to see. And, here, we do.

52:09.093 --> 52:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The book is
"Destiny and Power: The American
Odyssey of George Herbert Walker

52:13.230 --> 52:14.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bush,"
