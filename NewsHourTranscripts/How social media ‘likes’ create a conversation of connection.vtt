JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally
tonight: Linguist Deborah
Tannen has written a new
book on women's friendships,

00:06.600 --> 00:08.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
"You're the Only
One I Can Tell."

00:08.666 --> 00:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, tonight, she offers
her Humble Opinion on the
new language of liking.

DEBORAH TANNEN, Author, "You're
the Only One I Can Tell:
Inside the Language of Women's

00:13.833 --> 00:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friendships": For a book about
friendship, I interviewed
over 80 women, ages 9 to 97,

00:20.500 --> 00:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and heard a lot of worry
that people are getting
more self-absorbed,
constantly texting and

00:24.533 --> 00:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
posting pictures of trivial
things, like plates of food.

00:28.766 --> 00:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One woman complained: "I
don't care what somebody
had for dinner, all this
stuff out there that

00:33.333 --> 00:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nobody needs to know."

00:35.466 --> 00:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a linguistics professor,
so you might think I would
lament the effects of social

00:39.700 --> 00:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
media, especially how
it corrupts language.

00:43.133 --> 00:45.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But I don't.

00:45.133 --> 00:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have spent my career studying
the language of everyday
conversation, and I know that

00:49.433 --> 00:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most everyday talk isn't about
information we need to know.

00:53.433 --> 00:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about staying connected
to the people we care about.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a need
that social media is
extremely well-suited to.

01:00.633 --> 01:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My students at Georgetown
University have helped me
understand how this works.

01:07.566 --> 01:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They like each other's
pictures to show they're
paying attention, like
nodding and saying

01:10.366 --> 01:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uh-huh when a friend is talking.

01:12.333 --> 01:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they use tagging to link
their pictures to their friends'
accounts, drawing friends

01:17.833 --> 01:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into their circle.

01:19.833 --> 01:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A student in my class explained
that a photo of bowls of food
and glasses of wine might

01:25.333 --> 01:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seem to scream, look at me
and this cool party I had.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But tagging the friends who
brought the food and drink to
the party was a way to thank

01:31.133 --> 01:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them for helping make the party
a success, and to remind them
of the time they all spent

01:35.700 --> 01:37.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

01:37.033 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Surely, selfies are
self-indulgent, you might think.

01:40.300 --> 01:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the way my students
use them, they aren't,
at least not if they
observe selfie etiquette.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, a selfie usually
includes at least one other
person, so the one taking

01:49.900 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it isn't really
focusing on herself.

01:52.733 --> 01:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she shows she doesn't
take herself too seriously by
mugging and adding captions that

01:57.200 --> 02:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are funny or self-deprecating,
or, preferably, both.

02:00.966 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think of social media
as an extension of
the how-was-your-day
conversations that let

02:07.566 --> 02:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you know someone cares
about you, so you feel
less alone in the world.

02:10.433 --> 02:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not that I don't
see downsides, but those
are also extensions of
liabilities that have

02:16.166 --> 02:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
always been with us.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, seeing what your
friends and family are doing
when you're not there can

02:21.100 --> 02:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make you feel
included or left out.

02:25.833 --> 02:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Social media haven't
transformed human relations.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have intensified them.

02:30.466 --> 02:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While that means ramping up some
of the stresses and frailties
of friendships, it also gives

02:37.066 --> 02:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us new, more immediate, more
creative ways to stay connected
to the people we care about,

02:41.066 --> 02:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who care about us.
