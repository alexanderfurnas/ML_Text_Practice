JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: And I'm Alison
Stewart.

00:08.041 --> 00:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
the future of health care in the
balance.

00:11.712 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Obama and vice
president-elect Pence
head to the Hill to make their
case to lawmakers.

00:17.284 --> 00:21.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Also ahead this
Wednesday,
the second part of Judy's
conversation with

00:21.288 --> 00:25.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIA Director John Brennan,
looking ahead to
the Trump administration's
relationship with

00:25.659 --> 00:27.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russia and U.S. intelligence.

00:27.694 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, from Iraq,
as the battle
for Mosul continues, residents
flee to camps

00:33.567 --> 00:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where security concerns are
ripping families
apart.

00:37.104 --> 00:41.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE, Human Rights
Watch: Now, all
of them might be in official
detention facilities,

00:41.041 --> 00:44.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and maybe the moment the
operation is done,
we will see a lot of these
people released.

00:44.077 --> 00:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for the moment, we don't
know that, and
all their families know is that
they have

00:48.916 --> 00:50.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gone missing.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:52.119 --> 00:55.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.389 --> 01:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle over
repealing Obamacare
has been joined at the U.S.
Capitol tonight.

01:10.103 --> 01:15.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both the sitting president and
the incoming
vice president were there,
making their cases

01:15.275 --> 01:17.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for reprieve or repeal.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

01:20.013 --> 01:25.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the Capitol,
President
Obama and vice president-elect
Pence were

01:25.185 --> 01:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minutes apart in arrival, and
light years
apart in purpose.

01:29.256 --> 01:33.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama, in a private meeting
with Democrats,
urged them to defend his
signature health

01:33.360 --> 01:34.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care law.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Hello, everybody.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Happy new year.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While a few
floors up, Mr.
Pence rallied his former
Republican colleagues

01:40.067 --> 01:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the House to dismantle it.

01:42.169 --> 01:46.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said afterward that
Republicans are paying
attention to how to avoid ripple
effects of

01:46.807 --> 01:48.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repeal, for individuals and the
market.

01:48.842 --> 01:52.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R), Vice
President-Elect: We're
working right now, the White
House staff is,

01:52.746 --> 01:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a series of executive orders
that will
enable that orderly transition
to take place,

01:59.820 --> 02:06.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
even as the Congress
appropriately debates
alternatives to, and replacement
of, Obamacare.

02:06.593 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Pence gave no
specifics,
saying it's too soon.

02:10.263 --> 02:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who will have to wrestle
with the specifics,
rank-and-file Republicans,
focused on their

02:15.002 --> 02:15.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
energy.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It was more a pep rally.

02:17.938 --> 02:21.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for a
timeline on a Republican
replacement plan, Trump
transition team member

02:21.608 --> 02:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chris Collins and others offered
this.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS COLLINS (R), New York:
We're going to
have to, over the next six
months, put that

02:26.913 --> 02:27.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pen to paper.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.949 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRISTI NOEM (R), South Dakota:
Oh, absolutely.

02:30.751 --> 02:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's our agreed-upon agenda,
is to get it
done within six months.

02:35.222 --> 02:39.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not wholly united on one
idea right
now, but I would say we're
definitely in a

02:39.426 --> 02:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better spot than we were six
months ago.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is a good
time to explain
how Republicans plan this
repeal.

02:45.899 --> 02:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Step one, what's happening now,
is a procedural
move, not the actual repeal yet.

02:51.471 --> 02:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both chambers will instruct
committees to
submit budget ideas by January
27.

02:55.876 --> 03:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, step two, inside those
budget resolutions
will be the repeal of all or
part of Obamacare.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why budget resolutions?

03:04.951 --> 03:08.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They require just 51 votes in
the Senate.

03:08.922 --> 03:12.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So those budget plans will be
the actual repeal.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans hope to do that by
March.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Step three is the replacement,
and that could
come in several pieces.

03:17.998 --> 03:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you heard, many Republicans
want to propose
something within six months.

03:22.736 --> 03:28.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All of those decisions,
affecting nearly every
American, are politically
precarious.

03:28.041 --> 03:34.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump himself
warned Republicans
on Twitter today to be careful.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama didn't speak
publicly at the
Capitol today.

03:37.918 --> 03:42.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, Democratic leaders did
in a fiery
news conference, insisting
Republicans could

03:42.522 --> 03:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make things worse, a point
highlighted in
a new Trump-inspired motto.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: The
Republican plan to cut health
care wouldn't

03:50.297 --> 03:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make America great again.

03:52.466 --> 03:58.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would make America sick
again, and lead
to chaos, instead of affordable
care.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats are,
of course,
in the minority in both
chambers, but they

04:02.609 --> 04:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were joined by one Republican
this afternoon.

04:05.545 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky
voted against
the first procedural move toward
health care

04:10.217 --> 04:12.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
repeal, citing cost concerns.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It passed without him.

04:15.088 --> 04:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if Rand Paul continues
to be a no
vote, Republicans have enough
votes to repeal

04:20.494 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obamacare.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is not clear is if they
have enough votes
for any one replacement plan.

04:25.565 --> 04:30.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There will be a lot of
maneuvering and speeches
over the next couple of weeks,
but, Alison,

04:30.303 --> 04:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is key to watch for is the
decision Republicans
make as to when the Obamacare
repeal should

04:36.209 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take effect, quickly or over
years -- Alison.

04:39.312 --> 04:43.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: In the day's
other news: The
white supremacist who killed
nine black church

04:43.650 --> 04:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worshipers in Charleston, South
Carolina,
insisted he is not mentally ill.

04:48.355 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dylann Roof is acting as his own
lawyer for
the death penalty phase of his
federal hate

04:52.459 --> 04:54.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
crimes trial.

04:54.394 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his opening statement, he
said -- quote
-- "There is nothing wrong with
me psychologically."

04:58.098 --> 05:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't address his crimes,
and didn't ask
to be spared execution.

05:03.069 --> 05:06.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The prosecution argued that
Roof's actions
justify capital punishment.

05:06.606 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Turkey,
authorities say
they have identified the gunman
in a New Year's

05:11.044 --> 05:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eve nightclub attack that killed
39 people.

05:14.614 --> 05:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they didn't release the name
today, and
the killer remained at large.

05:18.752 --> 05:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish police detained 20
suspects linked
to the assault, all said to be
Islamic State

05:24.491 --> 05:27.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
militants, including 11 women.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan addressed
the nation, insisting he won't
surrender to

05:32.299 --> 05:34.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorists.

05:34.334 --> 05:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Nobody's lifestyle
is under systematic

05:39.272 --> 05:40.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
threat in Turkey.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will never allow this.

05:42.309 --> 05:46.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't allowed this since we
took the
helm 14 years ago.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anyone who claims otherwise must
prove it
with concrete examples.

05:49.282 --> 05:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Islamic State
group has
said the nightclub attack was
retaliation

05:54.654 --> 05:57.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Turkish military operations
in Northern
Syria.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: A military court
in Israel
has convicted a soldier of
manslaughter for

06:01.861 --> 06:05.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killing a Palestinian who had
stabbed another
soldier.

06:05.832 --> 06:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sergeant Elor Azaria shot the
attacker, who
was wounded, disarmed and laying
on the ground.

06:11.705 --> 06:16.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supporters of Azaria clashed
with police outside
the courtroom today, and Prime
Minister Benjamin

06:16.109 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Netanyahu called for Israel's
president to
grant a pardon.

06:19.479 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, president-elect
Trump announced he has chosen
Wall Street

06:24.217 --> 06:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer Jay Clayton to chair the
U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.

06:29.256 --> 06:34.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clayton is noted for his
expertise in public
and private mergers and public
offerings.

06:34.427 --> 06:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Macy's announced
today its
cutting more than 10,000 jobs
and going ahead

06:39.366 --> 06:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with plans to close 68 stores.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, retailers
helped lead
the way higher.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 60
points to close at 19942.

06:49.209 --> 06:55.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose almost 48
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added nearly 13.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
part two of my discussion with
the CIA director

07:00.053 --> 07:06.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- we talk about the
president-elect's distrust
of the intelligence community;
boys taken

07:06.126 --> 07:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from ISIS-held areas, never to
be heard from
again; and much more.

07:16.169 --> 07:22.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from ISIS-held areas, never to
be heard from
again; and much more.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return now to my conversation
with CIA
Director John Brennan.

07:27.013 --> 07:32.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, we focused largely
on allegations
of Russian hacking of U.S.
political operations

07:32.485 --> 07:35.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during the election and the war
in Syria.

07:35.388 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we begin with concerns
raised by
European intelligence officials
about possible

07:41.294 --> 07:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian intrusion in upcoming
elections there,
and whether Director Brennan
believes the

07:46.900 --> 07:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. is facing a new Cold War
with Russia.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director:
Well, I certainly
hope not.

07:52.572 --> 07:55.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I certainly hope that,
looking out over
the next several years, the
relationship between

07:55.842 --> 08:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moscow and Washington improves,
because it
is critically important for
global stability

08:00.180 --> 08:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the United States and Russia
to have a
better relationship, absolutely,
and so I

08:04.417 --> 08:06.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fully endorse that.

08:06.186 --> 08:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, we see that there are
still a lot
of actions that Russia is
undertaking that

08:10.623 --> 08:15.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
undermine the principles of
democracy in so
many countries.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What has happened in our recent
election is
not new.

08:17.664 --> 08:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians have engaged in
trying to manipulate
elections in Europe for a number
of years.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see that they take advantage
of corrupt
politicians.

08:28.475 --> 08:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will fund the parties and
groups that
support their aims.

08:33.446 --> 08:37.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so there's active
exploitation and manipulation
of the political processes.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But some now have
the sense
that this will all improve under
a President

08:42.021 --> 08:44.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, that this may have just
been a feature
of the Obama administration.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Oh, I don't think
it was a feature
of the Obama administration.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was more a feature of
the Putin
administration in terms of what
the Russians

08:51.164 --> 08:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been doing over the last
eight years,
and certainly before that.

08:55.602 --> 08:59.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not to say that we
cannot find ways
to be able to work together, the
United States

08:59.506 --> 09:00.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Russia.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, I think it's critically
important that
we do.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe now, with a new
administration,
there will be opportunities to
do that.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I certainly hope so.

09:07.147 --> 09:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the facts are that the
Russians tried
to interfere in our electoral
process recently,

09:13.520 --> 09:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and were actively involved in
that.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is something that we
can't countenance,
because, as you point out, there
are a number

09:19.125 --> 09:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of countries in Europe that are
going to be
having elections in this year,
whether it

09:22.896 --> 09:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be Germany, France, and others.

09:24.697 --> 09:28.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I must tell you, there is
level of anxiety
among my European counterparts
about what

09:28.535 --> 09:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russians might have up their
sleeve in
order to promote their
objectives in these

09:33.673 --> 09:35.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
electoral processes.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other
question about the
president-elect and the
intelligence community.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has been very critical of
parts of the
intelligence community.

09:40.980 --> 09:45.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has the well already been
poisoned before
he takes office between him and
the CIA, which

09:45.218 --> 09:47.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he has been particularly
critical of?

09:47.053 --> 09:49.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are your colleagues saying
to you about
that?

09:49.956 --> 09:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: The professionals
at the CIA
are very much looking forward to
having the

09:54.828 --> 10:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunity to demonstrate their
expertise,
their capabilities to the
incoming administration,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
president-elect, vice
president-elect, and
others.

10:03.470 --> 10:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so every time there's a
transition, the
CIA recognizes that it has a
special responsibility

10:08.608 --> 10:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and obligation to make sure
those who have
our national security in their
hands are going

10:12.745 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be as best informed and as
enlightened
as possible about the
complexities of world

10:16.950 --> 10:18.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I know there have been a
lot of things
in the media and the press.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have told our folks, just
focus on your
work and look forward to the
opportunity to

10:25.325 --> 10:26.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brief the incoming team.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, nothing is soured at this
point.

10:29.028 --> 10:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really do believe that
agency officers
are ready and looking forward to
this opportunity.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A few other
important parts
of the world I want to ask you
about.

10:37.103 --> 10:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea, over the weekend,
its leader,
Kim Jong-un, said that his
country is -- quote

10:41.574 --> 10:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "finalizing preparations of a
test launch
of an intercontinental ballistic
missile,"

10:46.880 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which one assumes would mark --
well, would
mark an advance in Korea's
attempt to build

10:53.219 --> 10:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a nuclear weapon capable of
reaching the United
States.

10:57.090 --> 11:01.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are the North Koreans as far
along as it sounds
like they are?

11:01.094 --> 11:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much should the United
States, should
the incoming president be
concerned about

11:06.499 --> 11:08.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: I think the
incoming administration
needs to be very concerned about
North Korea.

11:10.436 --> 11:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They continue to advance their
ballistic missile
capability, and as Kim Jong-un
said, even

11:14.974 --> 11:17.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the intercontinental
ballistic range.

11:17.410 --> 11:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They continue to develop their
nuclear program
in terms of having nuclear
capability that

11:23.816 --> 11:26.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they could then marry with a
ballistic missile.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that would be a threat and
is a threat
to regional states, as well as
potentially

11:29.989 --> 11:31.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the U.S. homeland.

11:31.891 --> 11:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the trajectory that
Pyongyang has
been on over the past two
decades, to include

11:36.563 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last number of years under
Kim Jong-un,
has not been a good path.

11:42.602 --> 11:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we, the United States, along
with our
partners and allies around the
world, to include

11:47.540 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
China, which has an
extraordinary amount of
influence on North Korea, we
need to work

11:52.845 --> 11:57.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
together to change that
trajectory, so that
North Korea doesn't pose that
threat to regional

11:57.984 --> 11:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stability, as well as to global
stability.

11:59.819 --> 12:04.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your
administration has, in
effect, celebrated the nuclear
agreement with

12:04.057 --> 12:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran, holding off Iran's ability
to have a
breakout capability when it
comes to nuclear

12:10.396 --> 12:11.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does North Korea represent a
failure in that
regard?

12:13.466 --> 12:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, North Korea
has been embarked
on this for the last couple of
decades, it's

12:17.170 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clear.

12:18.972 --> 12:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been a number of
steps taken
to try to prevent its continued
march along

12:22.942 --> 12:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this path in terms of sanctions
and international
program and criticism and
isolation of North

12:28.348 --> 12:29.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

12:29.916 --> 12:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Kim Jong-un and his father
and grandfather
before him were on this path.

12:33.152 --> 12:41.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's a -- it's an
unfortunate failure
of the international community
to find a way

12:41.628 --> 12:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring North Korea to its
senses, so that
it can focus on the health and
well-being

12:45.832 --> 12:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and welfare of its people, who
are impoverished,
and for him not to be able to
continue to

12:51.137 --> 12:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invest in a military capability
that is only
leading to North Korea's
continued isolation.

12:56.509 --> 13:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How close is
North Korea to
being able to strike the United
States with

13:00.813 --> 13:02.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a nuclear weapon?

13:02.582 --> 13:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: To me, the fact
that he has
a ballistic missile capability
and he has

13:05.585 --> 13:11.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that he is going on the
intercontinental
side of it, and he has a nuclear
capability,

13:11.457 --> 13:12.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to me, that's too close.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what does
that mean?

13:14.193 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean...

13:16.062 --> 13:25.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: It means that we
cannot be -- we
shouldn't feel comfortable with
the continued

13:25.672 --> 13:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military capabilities and the
growth of those
capabilities in North Korea.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That needs to be addressed.

13:32.278 --> 13:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What should
president-elect
Trump, once he's in office, and
your successor,

13:37.650 --> 13:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman now Mike Pompeo, be
lying awake
worrying about in the months to
come, more

13:43.556 --> 13:44.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than anything else?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think it's
all these
things.

13:46.459 --> 13:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's trying to make sure that
they understand
the complexities of the various
challenges

13:52.198 --> 13:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are out there, whether
you're talking
about a Ukraine or Iraq or Syria
or North

13:56.703 --> 14:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea or any of the issues we
deal with cyber
and terrorism.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are complex and
complicated issues.

14:03.576 --> 14:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're not -- they don't
lend themselves
to easy and simple solutions.

14:09.415 --> 14:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, in my experience, the
past five,
eight years or so, the number of
these challenges

14:15.855 --> 14:17.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continues to go up.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it's not just
complexities of these
issues.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the simultaneity of it.

14:21.694 --> 14:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the United States is the
global superpower,
remains so.

14:26.699 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they need to worry
about is how are
they going to ensure that
they're able to

14:31.037 --> 14:34.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
monitor what's going on around
the world,
protect U.S. national security
interests,

14:34.941 --> 14:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not overcommit, and also make
sure that the
policy course that they stake
out is one that

14:41.347 --> 14:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has near-term interests in mind,
but also
longer-term strategic goals and
objectives

14:47.754 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you believe
they're up to
that challenge?

14:50.857 --> 14:55.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: I believe that any
administration
that comes in, I think,
sometimes is taken

14:55.962 --> 15:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aback by the scope, the scale,
the complexity
of the problems.

15:00.166 --> 15:05.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was part of the incoming Obama
administration,
and I had served in government
before.

15:05.037 --> 15:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I must tell you, once you
have that responsibility,
it's rather daunting.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And where will
John Brennan
be?

15:11.477 --> 15:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: I will be on the
sidelines,
will be finishing up on
Inauguration Day.

15:16.048 --> 15:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the absolute best
job that I could
ever imagine.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this will be my last job
in government.

15:22.755 --> 15:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will be doing what I can
to support
our national security from the
sidelines.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Brennan, the
director
of the CIA, thank you very much
for joining

15:32.165 --> 15:33.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Thank you, Judy.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

15:36.068 --> 15:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
my entire
interview with Director Brennan
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

15:39.238 --> 15:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we explore the widening rift
between the
president-elect and the
intelligence community.

15:47.013 --> 15:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After we recorded the Brennan
interview yesterday,
Mr. Trump tweeted: "The
'intelligence' briefing

15:53.619 --> 15:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on so-called 'Russian hacking'
was delayed
until Friday.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Perhaps more time need to build
a case.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very strange!"

16:02.528 --> 16:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that briefing, it was
widely reported,
was always scheduled for Friday.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this divide, or what
appears to
be a divide, we turn to James
Woolsey.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the CIA director during
the Clinton
administration.

16:14.507 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is now at Booz Allen, a major
defense contractor,
and he is a senior adviser to
the Trump transition.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jeffrey Smith, he's a former
general counsel
at the CIA.

16:25.117 --> 16:30.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He currently serves on the
Department of Defense
Legal Policy Advisory Board.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

16:32.558 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I'm going to start with you,
James Woolsey.

16:34.493 --> 16:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These tweets that we're quoting
from Donald
Trump are just the latest in a
series of statements

16:38.531 --> 16:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's made dismissing either the
CIA or the
intelligence agency.

16:43.469 --> 16:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does he -- you're advising
the transition.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does he really think of the
professionals
in the intelligence community?

16:49.475 --> 16:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY, Former CIA
Director: I think
he's got an open mind.

16:52.278 --> 16:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we need to have some
things take place
which haven't taken place yet.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He needs to get to know the top
people in
the agency.

17:02.455 --> 17:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they need to go the
extra mile in
order to present things to him
in a way that

17:08.160 --> 17:09.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he wants.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't want the morning
briefing, apparently.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, neither did Bill Clinton
when I was
director of central
intelligence.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He read the briefing and asked
questions sometimes.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there's not any one way to do
that.

17:21.507 --> 17:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the point is that they need
to find out
what will help him get into this
very important

17:28.247 --> 17:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job quickly and effectively and
plan their
presentations that way, rather
than complaining,

17:34.620 --> 17:36.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
frankly.

17:36.422 --> 17:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeffrey Smith,
what do you
make of what we have heard,
really just a

17:40.059 --> 17:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stream of critical comments by
Donald Trump
about the intelligence
community, the CIA

17:45.531 --> 17:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the rest of it?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SMITH, Former CIA
General Counsel:
I find them deeply disturbing
and potentially

17:49.969 --> 17:51.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very dangerous.

17:51.871 --> 17:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're disturbing because he
seems to be
saying, I don't trust the
intelligence community.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't know quite why he
believes that.

18:00.846 --> 18:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We all understand they have made
mistakes
in the past, but I think they
have also understand

18:07.153 --> 18:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how important it is to get it
right.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think he's prejudging them
a little bit.

18:11.490 --> 18:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they're dangerous
because he's
set in motion all kinds of
potential conflicts

18:16.062 --> 18:19.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
down the road and some
uncertainty with our
allies.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It may go further
than criticism.

18:21.067 --> 18:25.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are just tonight seeing,
literally just
in the last few minutes, Jim
Woolsey and Jeffrey

18:25.671 --> 18:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smith, a report in The Wall
Street Journal
that a source close to Donald
Trump, the Trump

18:30.142 --> 18:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transition, is saying that he's
looking at
restructuring the entire
intelligence community,

18:35.948 --> 18:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
frankly, overhauling the CIA.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is it your understand
understanding that that's
what he may be up to?

18:41.787 --> 18:49.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: There's been talk
about this
not just within the Trump
transition, but

18:49.595 --> 18:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the community now for
some months,
verging into years.

18:53.966 --> 18:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the reason is that the
director of
national intelligence, which
does the sort

18:59.705 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of chairman of the board job
that used to
be done by the director of
central intelligence,

19:05.544 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as managing the CIA,
that sort of
chairman of the board job was
done more or

19:11.917 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less by 18, 19 people when I was
director
back in the '93-'94 time.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

19:19.558 --> 19:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: It's now done in
one way or
another by 2,000 or 3,000.

19:25.197 --> 19:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been a huge surge
in numbers
of people in the community as a
whole, not

19:32.038 --> 19:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just at the CIA, and I think
they're going
to, understandably, take a look
at that.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Jeffrey
Smith, we don't
know -- again, this report just
came out by

19:39.478 --> 19:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal, and the
person, the
source is not named.

19:42.648 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what would an overhaul like
that mean?

19:45.151 --> 19:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY SMITH: Well, I agree
with Jim.

19:46.919 --> 19:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the size of the ODNI staff
could be reduced
and streamlined, I think that's
good.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has become overhead that is
largely unnecessary.

19:55.327 --> 19:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the story also suggests that
CIA should
do more in the field.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's probably right.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also think that it's wise
for an administration
to come in and take the measure
of things

20:07.006 --> 20:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before they start reshuffling
everything,
because a huge amount of effort
would be spent

20:13.479 --> 20:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on reorganizing things at a time
when that
energy would be better spent, it
seems to

20:19.952 --> 20:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, on addressing the crises
that exist in
the world.

20:22.655 --> 20:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I want to
come back, Jim
Woolsey, to what Donald Trump
has been saying.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's siding -- frankly, appears
to be siding
with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks
over the

20:33.299 --> 20:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CIA, pretty much dismissing the
CIA and the
entire intelligence community
finding that

20:39.805 --> 20:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians were behind this
hacking of the
Democrats during the election.

20:45.111 --> 20:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we have any precedent for an
incoming president
of the United States having this
much disregard

20:52.818 --> 20:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the entire intelligence
community?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Well, I don't
know that it's
disregard.

20:55.721 --> 20:58.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It certainly is raising issues.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no doubt about is that.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump does that in his
own way.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He raised issues in a way that
turned out
to be very successful for him
politically,

21:07.766 --> 21:11.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got him elected president of the
United States,
when virtually everybody that he
talked to

21:11.871 --> 21:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said you can't raise issues that
way.

21:14.039 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think we all need to take
half a step
back and look at the fact that
he handles

21:20.146 --> 21:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like this differently
than a lot of
other people.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me stop and
ask Jeffrey
Smith.

21:25.351 --> 21:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Jim Woolsey said a few
moments ago was
that the intelligence community
needs find

21:29.922 --> 21:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another way to come to Donald
Trump.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he doesn't like the way the
current briefings
are structured, they need to
find another

21:35.995 --> 21:37.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way to do it.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Could that be a solution here?

21:38.664 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SMITH: That could help.

21:40.466 --> 21:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However it's done matters less
than they need
to convince the president, their
new boss,

21:46.572 --> 21:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they can be trusted.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he needs to work to develop
their trust.

21:50.409 --> 21:55.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This has to be a mutual
understanding of trust
between both sides, because
there's going

21:55.314 --> 22:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be some crisis very early in
the administration,
and the president is going to
rely on what

22:00.452 --> 22:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he hears from the intelligence
community.

22:02.922 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he has been saying before
he became
president that they can't be
trusted, what

22:07.293 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does he say to the American
people now that
I'm relying on them to make
recommendations

22:12.198 --> 22:13.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to take action?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jim Woolsey,
I think that's
the question, because if
something comes up

22:15.734 --> 22:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Donald Trump has declared
that he doesn't
trust the CIA, what does that
mean?

22:20.272 --> 22:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Well, I think
those -- some
things like that can be
surmounted by spending

22:25.110 --> 22:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some time together and so forth.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think that's the main
problem.

22:29.014 --> 22:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main problem is that I think
the entire
leadership, not just the
president-elect himself,

22:34.587 --> 22:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the entire leadership in the
national
security area needs to realize
that one of

22:39.959 --> 22:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most important things you're
going to
do in this job is deal with
crises of one

22:44.096 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort or another.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in crises, it has
historically been the
case that almost always the
first reports

22:49.668 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are wrong.

22:51.470 --> 22:56.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You cannot deal with them by
making a quick
judgment based on the first
things that you

22:56.542 --> 22:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hear, even though they sound --
if they sound
reasonable.

22:58.477 --> 23:05.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Tonkin Gulf resolution is
one example
of something that was taken off
of a non-occurrence.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That sounds like
a warning
to the incoming administration.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What other advice would you
have, just quickly,
Jeffrey Smith?

23:11.690 --> 23:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SMITH: Mr. Trump has had
an extraordinary
business career, but dealing
with sovereign

23:17.429 --> 23:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states with nuclear weapons is
fundamentally
different than building a golf
course in Scotland.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has to understand that he has
huge responsibilities.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has to be extremely careful
about what
he says.

23:30.409 --> 23:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has to listen to those
terrific professionals
in the intelligence community,
the diplomatic

23:35.547 --> 23:37.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
community, the military
community.

23:37.816 --> 23:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to begin to trust him,
and he has
to begin to trust them.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeffrey Smith,
Jim Woolsey,
we thank you both.

23:43.622 --> 23:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Good to be with
you, as always.

23:48.727 --> 23:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SMITH: Thank you.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Stay with us.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
protests against
Senator Jeff Sessions, Donald
Trump's pick

24:01.974 --> 24:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for attorney general; and the
potential for
nuclear technology to lower
carbon emissions.

24:08.947 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: For nearly three
months, Iraqi
forces backed by the U.S. have
been fighting

24:13.385 --> 24:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to re-take the ISIS-held city of
Mosul.

24:16.255 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The militants still hold much of
the city
and its nearly one million
residents.

24:20.859 --> 24:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost 130,000 people have fled
Mosul since
the battle began.

24:25.331 --> 24:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security officials are now
trying to harbor
the displaced, while also
containing the spread

24:29.268 --> 24:31.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of ISIS.

24:31.036 --> 24:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the process of screening and
detaining
men and boys who have left to
ensure they

24:34.506 --> 24:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are not extremists is fraught
and controversial.

24:38.077 --> 24:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Northern Iraq, special
correspondent
Marcia Biggs and videographer
Eric O'Conner

24:41.880 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(ph) report.

24:43.615 --> 24:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It's a slow and
steady exodus,
civilians fleeing the battle for
Mosul.

24:49.254 --> 24:53.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Those who make it to the
relative safety of
Iraqi checkpoints tell harrowing
stories.

24:53.859 --> 24:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): A
mortar landed
on my house, destroyed it, and
killed my wife.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had no place to bury her, and
now our daughter
has no mother.

25:02.368 --> 25:07.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The danger of
Mosul behind them,
they are first screened by
Iraqis, then boarded

25:07.840 --> 25:10.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
onto buses for a journey into
the unknown.

25:10.409 --> 25:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
shelling destroyed
us.

25:13.612 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All our houses are gone now.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nothing remains for us.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you know where
you're going?

25:18.884 --> 25:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
don't know,
but they are saying that they
are taking us

25:21.787 --> 25:23.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the tents.

25:23.589 --> 25:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: They're heading to
a handful
of camps for internally
displaced people here

25:28.460 --> 25:33.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Iraqi-held Kurdistan.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a long wait.

25:35.267 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're facing a bottleneck from
previous
buses as the newly arrived
register and receive

25:39.571 --> 25:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supplies, and, at every stage,
more screening.

25:43.142 --> 25:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both Iraqi security forces and
the Kurdish
authorities have a mandate to
keep members

25:47.546 --> 25:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ISIS from escaping through
the mass of
civilians fleeing the battle,
and they have

25:52.518 --> 25:57.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gathered intelligence on tens of
thousands
of ISIS suspects, creating a
database with

25:57.556 --> 25:59.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a list of names.

25:59.324 --> 26:01.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everywhere we went in the camps,
we heard
the same story.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
only have one
son.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They took him 20 days ago.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know where he is.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went to get gas and they just
took him.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's innocent.

26:12.438 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Aziza says she and
her 18-year-old
son, Radwan, escaped Mosul, only
to be ripped

26:16.542 --> 26:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apart by local authorities once
they arrived
at the camp.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): Oh,
my son.

26:23.015 --> 26:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel safe here, but I feel sad
because he's
not here.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The tent is empty.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been 20 days since they
took him.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm cold and empty without him.

26:32.691 --> 26:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: This man wouldn't
let us show
his face, but says his cousin
was arrested,

26:37.463 --> 26:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
based on what he says was the
word of an informer
in the camp.

26:40.299 --> 26:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE, Human Rights
Watch: In Mosul,
we have got thousands of
individuals being

26:44.169 --> 26:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screened, subsequently being
detained, and
disappearing.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Belkis Wille is
with Human Rights
Watch, based in Iraq.

26:50.809 --> 26:54.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE: Now, all of them
might be in
official detention facilities,
and maybe the

26:54.880 --> 26:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment the operation is done, we
will see
a lot of these people released.

26:57.716 --> 27:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for the moment, we don't
know that, and
all their families know is that
they have

27:02.488 --> 27:04.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gone missing.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: General Najim
al-Jabouri is
one of Iraq's top commanders in
the battle

27:06.658 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Mosul, and his men are the
first line
of screening for civilians
coming out of ISIS

27:11.463 --> 27:13.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They detain anyone who appears
on the list,
even though he knows some may
not be hard-line

27:17.569 --> 27:18.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is members.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

27:20.472 --> 27:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAJIM AL-JABOURI, Iraq: I hope
the prime minister
give amnesty to the majority of
the people,

27:26.678 --> 27:32.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
join ISIS, but they not kill,
they not involved
in very bad thing.

27:32.718 --> 27:39.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just to took some salary to
keep them
and families from revenge of
ISIS.

27:39.725 --> 27:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, ISIS don't have any
mercy.

27:43.395 --> 27:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: They're just
trying to stay
alive and feed their families.

27:46.231 --> 27:47.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAJIM AL-JABOURI: Yes, yes.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Is there ever
anyone that's
on that list that you say he's
just someone

27:51.370 --> 27:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's trying to get by, let's
let him go?

27:53.405 --> 27:54.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAJIM AL-JABOURI: Yes, sure.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, sure.

27:57.643 --> 28:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the judge will decide that,
not me.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I fight in the field.

28:03.849 --> 28:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anyone stand in front of me and
fight me,
I kill him.

28:08.921 --> 28:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But after the field, this the
mission of the
judge.

28:14.059 --> 28:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: We traveled south
of Mosul to
Qayyarah, where, under the black
cloud of

28:18.463 --> 28:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil fires set by ISIS, we found
one of those
judges, whose job is to
investigate the cases

28:24.236 --> 28:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of ISIS suspects and prepare
them for trial.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How many people are on the list?

28:29.141 --> 28:31.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We heard 40,000?

28:31.076 --> 28:33.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMER ABDULLAH KHODIR, Judge
(through translator):
No, there are more than 40,000
who are not

28:33.445 --> 28:35.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arrested yet.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: How do you
differentiate between
someone who is just trying to
make ends meet

28:38.183 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in occupied Mosul, and someone
who is an ISIS
terrorist?

28:41.954 --> 28:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMER ABDULLAH KHODIR (through
translator):
We have people who are helping
us identify

28:44.957 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the individuals who were just
doing their
job, without being members of
ISIS.

28:49.094 --> 28:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE: The real question
for us is,
how do you get onto that list?

28:54.032 --> 28:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's allegations that you are
affiliated with
ISIS, but they could be made by
your neighbor,

28:58.403 --> 29:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your neighbor who envies your
land or your
neighbor who had a feud with you
for many

29:03.408 --> 29:05.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The judge denies
that charges
can be based solely on witness
testimony,

29:08.780 --> 29:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but admits that the system is
bogged down.

29:10.882 --> 29:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMER ABDULLAH KHODIR (through
translator):
It will take a long time to
complete these

29:13.819 --> 29:15.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In most of the cases, the
victims' bodies
are missing.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were kidnapped by ISIS
terrorists, killed
and disappeared.

29:21.927 --> 29:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to find the bodies, but
this will
prolong the investigations.

29:25.330 --> 29:30.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: For the families
of those that
languish in detention, it's a
reminder of

29:30.736 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abuses against Sunnis that took
place last
spring, when Iraqi forces retook
Fallujah

29:35.974 --> 29:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from ISIS, but then allowed Shia
militias
to control those villages.

29:39.544 --> 29:43.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE: We know the
history of previous
operations, and we know that
hundreds of people

29:43.515 --> 29:44.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have gone missing.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not saying let everybody
go.

29:46.351 --> 29:51.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're saying is, there are
simple things
you can do to try and decrease
the chance

29:51.123 --> 29:52.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of abuse afterwards.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of those things is informing
family members
of where their loved ones are.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other is putting out public
numbers.

29:58.697 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why have we not seen the
authorities put out
a single public number on how
many people

30:03.135 --> 30:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are being detained in this
operation?

30:05.003 --> 30:08.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: This is your
husband, Zaojek?

30:08.206 --> 30:14.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the camp, 27-year-old
Miad shows me
the only picture she has of her
husband, Ramy.

30:14.479 --> 30:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says they had been here for
10 days when
he went to camp security to get
permission

30:18.717 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for her to see a doctor.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He never came back.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIAD, Lives in Camp (through
translator):
The night that they arrested
him, I waited

30:25.657 --> 30:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up until midnight, but he didn't
come.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I went to the camp manager.

30:30.662 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said it's a normal
investigation, and he
will be back soon, it will only
take a couple

30:35.100 --> 30:36.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of days.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was 17 days ago.

30:38.203 --> 30:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember they put his name in
the database
two times, and they didn't find
anything on

30:43.909 --> 30:44.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

30:44.910 --> 30:45.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was cleared.

30:45.977 --> 30:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't have anything to do
with ISIS.

30:48.046 --> 30:52.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: She's here alone
with her two
children and her 80-year-old
grandmother.

30:52.317 --> 30:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diagnosed with uterine cancer,
she has special
permission to go to her
chemotherapy appointments,

30:57.889 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but like everyone else, is
otherwise forbidden
to leave the camp.

31:01.460 --> 31:06.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIAD (through translator): I
went to the camp
security and he didn't give me
any information.

31:06.264 --> 31:10.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just told me, if he is
innocent, we will
bring him back to you.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he's guilty, don't ask about
him.

MARCIA BIGGS: Halkwat Rafaat is
in charge
of security at the camps in this
area, in

31:17.375 --> 31:21.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
total hosting almost 60,000
people.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why they are not allowed to
leave the camp?

31:22.848 --> 31:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HALKWAT RAFAAT, Iraq (through
translator):
Because they have been under is
control for

31:26.118 --> 31:27.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more than two years.

31:27.919 --> 31:31.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And you are
worried that maybe
there may be ISIS fighters
hiding in plaint

31:31.757 --> 31:32.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sight?

31:32.991 --> 31:34.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HALKWAT RAFAAT (through
translator): Of course
they are.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: What do you say to
the officials
that say, we have got a real
security problem;

31:38.330 --> 31:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we can't let people leave?

31:40.298 --> 31:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE: If the screening
processes are
not working, then improve the
screening processes.

31:43.502 --> 31:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once someone's been cleared
through that
process, it is unacceptable to
be holding

31:47.105 --> 31:49.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them in a camp that is
essentially being used
as a prison.

31:49.975 --> 31:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Miad says she now
wishes she
had never left Mosul.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIAD (through translator): I
need my husband
by my side.

31:57.215 --> 32:01.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I am sick, he takes care of
the kids,
and makes sure we have food.

32:01.953 --> 32:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now I have no one, only God
and my two
kids.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My life here is very hard.

32:08.260 --> 32:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I had known they would arrest
my husband,
I never would have left my
village.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Some residents
held out.

32:18.703 --> 32:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi armed forces had cleared
this village
in North Mosul 20 days ago when
we arrived,

32:23.642 --> 32:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the civilians here chose not
to go to
the camps.

32:26.444 --> 32:31.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that the Iraqi army
controls this
area, checkpoints are
everywhere, and no one

32:31.249 --> 32:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes in or out without special
permission.

32:34.653 --> 32:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they're grateful to be
rid of ISIS,
but say there is no clean water,
no electricity,

32:39.925 --> 32:41.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not enough food.

32:41.693 --> 32:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have received
food only two times in the last
two weeks.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need gas for the generators.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't want to go to the
camps.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to stay here to keep
what is ours.

32:51.670 --> 32:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Half-an-hour
later, we were
at a former ISIS bomb factory
looking at some

32:56.107 --> 33:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vehicles that ISIS left behind.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were hustled to a nearby home
to wait out
the shelling.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we just received a mortar
from around five
to six kilometers away.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The general believes that
perhaps one of the
civilians that saw us talking to
all of the

33:11.990 --> 33:16.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
neighbors may have given
information to ISIS
that we were here, which is why
we have received

33:16.561 --> 33:18.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this mortar.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no way to know for sure
if someone
informed on us, but it is a
reminder that,

33:21.733 --> 33:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even in so-called liberated
areas, there is
still a very real war being
fought.

33:27.272 --> 33:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who choose to stay may
keep their homes
and their dignity, but they now
live in a

33:31.209 --> 33:37.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state of limbo between ISIS and
the Iraqi
army, and with that comes
suspicion and danger.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eight more rounds hit areas
around us that
afternoon.

33:41.019 --> 33:45.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This local villager emerged from
his home
carrying a white flag and
begging the army

33:45.724 --> 33:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to let him take his family to
the next village.

33:48.793 --> 33:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was told to stay in his home.

33:53.231 --> 33:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the camp, Miad may be
out of the line
of fire, but she faces every day
alone, no

33:59.471 --> 34:00.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
information, no answers.

34:00.972 --> 34:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIAD (through translator): God
willing, he
will come back to us.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am not the only one.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Too many others have been taken
who have nothing
to do with ISIS.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: For now, all she
can do is wait.

34:13.451 --> 34:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs,
outside Mosul, Northern Iraq.

34:21.793 --> 34:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: The confirmation
hearings
for president-elect Trump's
controversial

34:32.637 --> 34:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick for U.S. attorney general,
Alabama Senator
Jeff Sessions, are next week,
but already

34:38.043 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his detractors are making
themselves heard.

34:40.445 --> 34:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NAACP mounted protests
across Alabama
on Tuesday against the Sessions
nomination.

34:51.423 --> 34:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Mobile, the group's national
president,
Cornell Brooks, and five others
staged a sit-in

34:56.328 --> 34:58.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the senator's local office.

34:58.630 --> 35:03.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were finally arrested for
trespassing,
when they refused to leave as
the office closed

35:03.201 --> 35:05.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

35:05.103 --> 35:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, more than 1,100 law
professors
wrote to leaders of the Senate
Judiciary Committee,

35:10.275 --> 35:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said, in part -- quote --
"Nothing in
Senator Sessions' public life
since 1986 has

35:16.181 --> 35:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convinced us that he is a
different man than
the 39-year-old attorney who was
deemed too

35:20.485 --> 35:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
racially insensitive to be a
federal judge."

35:23.755 --> 35:28.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sessions' own Senate career
began 20 years
ago, but that failed
confirmation battle still

35:28.893 --> 35:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
echoes in this new fight.

35:31.262 --> 35:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NAACP and others cite at
least three reasons
to disqualify him as attorney
general, on

35:37.569 --> 35:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voting rights, his support for
stricter I.D.
laws and criticism of the 1965
Voting Rights

35:42.540 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act, on civil rights, claims
Sessions has
repeatedly supported attempts to
overturn

35:48.179 --> 35:50.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
desegregation.

35:50.048 --> 35:55.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On criminal justice reform, the
NAACP Highlights
his opposition to consent
decrees to reform

35:55.120 --> 35:56.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police departments.

35:56.688 --> 36:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this comes to a head next
week, at
Sessions' confirmation hearings.

36:01.793 --> 36:05.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big question is, what kind
of attorney
general could Sessions be?

36:05.997 --> 36:10.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For an idea, let's take closer
look at his
record in the Senate, as well as
his career

36:10.135 --> 36:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a prosecutor in Alabama.

36:12.270 --> 36:17.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are joined by John Sharp, a
reporter for
the Alabama Media Group, and
Sari Horwitz.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She covers the Department of
Justice for The
Washington Post.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John, I want to start with you.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions
III has never
lost an election.

36:26.918 --> 36:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So over the course of his career
as a prosecutor,
as Alabama's attorney general,
and as a senator,

36:33.191 --> 36:35.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what contributes to his
popularity back at
home in Alabama?

36:35.260 --> 36:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHARP, Alabama Media Group:
Well, he
stayed true to his roots over
the years.

36:38.763 --> 36:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's an ultraconservative
politician, and
he's never really wavered from
that.

36:44.936 --> 36:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Alabama is one of the
reddest of the red
states.

36:48.440 --> 36:55.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It has supported a GOP
presidential candidate
since 1980.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's only getting redder.

36:57.082 --> 37:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's returns on
November 8 were
the most that a presidential
candidate's had

37:03.488 --> 37:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Alabama since Richard Nixon
in 1972.

37:06.391 --> 37:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Senator Sessions has -- you
know, he's
been a darling for the
conservative movement

37:12.130 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Alabama.

37:13.698 --> 37:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he has a spotless election
record.

37:18.169 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His conservative viewpoints on
anything from
gun control to immigration
reform to religious

37:25.043 --> 37:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberty has really sold well
with the conservative
voters here in this state who
turn out and

37:30.482 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dominate on Election Days.

37:32.283 --> 37:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: What's an
example of a way
he stayed true to his roots on
the local level?

37:35.753 --> 37:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHARP: Back in the early
2000s, he -- The
Mobile Press-Register at the
time ran a series

37:40.625 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of stories about dental services
in underserved
areas, in small rural counties.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Senator Sessions, he saw
those stories.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was interested in them.

37:54.739 --> 37:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he traveled around to
various county where's
these clinics were located and
people weren't

37:59.577 --> 38:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
receiving dental services.

38:01.412 --> 38:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, he made quite a
high-profile
splash at the time, at least on
a local level,

38:08.219 --> 38:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about wanting to get federal
money set aside
for some of these clinics to
help support

38:12.757 --> 38:16.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them and provide services for
folks at the
time that were not receiving
them.

38:16.594 --> 38:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Sari, when
Sessions was the
U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of

38:20.999 --> 38:25.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alabama, he was described by one
paper as
an in-the-trenches prosecutor.

38:25.370 --> 38:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the national level, how does
he work as
a senator?

38:28.373 --> 38:33.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ, The Washington
Post: Well, he's
very respected by his
colleagues.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's courteous and friendly.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he works well in the Senate.

38:38.883 --> 38:40.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's been there for 20 years.

38:40.852 --> 38:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's really known for some
very extreme
views on immigration, hard-line
views on immigration.

38:47.225 --> 38:54.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in some cases, he's
actually struck out
in opposition to his Republican
colleagues

38:55.033 --> 39:01.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and spoken out against
legislation, especially
on immigration, that was
supported by his

39:01.072 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican colleagues.

39:02.874 --> 39:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: John, when
Sessions was up
for a federal judgeship in the
1980s, he had

39:07.845 --> 39:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some very tough hearings.

39:09.681 --> 39:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was testimony that he
called another
attorney, a black attorney boy,
that he joked

39:14.652 --> 39:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the KKK, that he had
disparaging words
about the NAACP and the ACLU.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He obviously didn't get that
post.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did that play pack home?

39:24.762 --> 39:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHARP: Well, that was an
initial setback
for Senator Sessions, but it
played -- it

39:29.867 --> 39:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
played really well back at home.

39:32.904 --> 39:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, the people that
were opposing
Senator Sessions were some of
the big names

39:38.343 --> 39:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Democratic Party back
then, Ted Kennedy,
Joe Biden, Senator Paul Simon
from Illinois.

39:44.649 --> 39:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And folks back home in Alabama
saw that and
looked upon the whole situation
as, well,

39:51.389 --> 39:53.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's us vs. them.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Jeff Sessions
was one of the
first senators, if not the first
senator,

39:55.927 --> 39:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to support candidate Trump.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's such an interesting
mix.

39:59.597 --> 40:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have this millionaire from
New York and
this down-to-his-roots son of
the South.

40:04.836 --> 40:05.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do they meet?

40:05.837 --> 40:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: You're right.

40:07.305 --> 40:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was actually the first
senator in February
to endorse Donald Trump.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They met several years ago.

40:13.111 --> 40:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump came to testify on
Capitol Hill,
and they really hit it off.

40:17.448 --> 40:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're both -- they both have
deeply conservative
views.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They see the world the same way.

40:23.121 --> 40:30.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They see the world as sort of
divided between
working class and the elites.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Sessions refers to the
elites as masters
of the universe.

40:33.564 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think both Donald Trump and
Senator Sessions
see themselves, they position
themselves as

40:39.070 --> 40:40.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
champions of the working class.

40:40.805 --> 40:45.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Sari, almost two
years ago,
Jeff Sessions was on the Hill,
and he was

40:45.977 --> 40:49.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addressing attorney general
candidate Loretta
Lynch, and he said this:

40:49.981 --> 40:51.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS (R), Alabama: You
will have
to tell the president yes or no
on something

40:53.751 --> 40:55.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he may want to do.

40:56.020 --> 41:02.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you able and willing to tell
the president
of the United States no if he
asks to -- permission

41:02.894 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a legal opinion that supports
an action
you believe is wrong?

41:07.498 --> 41:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Sari, has Jeff
Sessions ever
been in that position, when he's
had to go

41:11.269 --> 41:14.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the grain, when he's had
to say no
or yes to something like that?

41:14.672 --> 41:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: I remember that
moment when
he said that to Loretta Lynch,
and he actually

41:18.676 --> 41:23.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ended up voting against Loretta
Lynch, partially
because of her answer, which was
that she

41:23.448 --> 41:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supported President Obama's
executive actions
on immigration.

41:27.952 --> 41:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Sessions himself has gone
against the
grain, but it's really been in
the Senate,

41:32.657 --> 41:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, against his own party,
when he took
on views on immigration that
were opposed

41:38.129 --> 41:39.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by other Republicans.

41:39.997 --> 41:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I said, the Republicans
backed and Democrats
in 2013 backed an immigration
bill, and he

41:47.271 --> 41:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spoke out strongly against it.

41:49.273 --> 41:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has gone against the grain
when he really,
deeply believes in something, as
he does on

41:54.512 --> 41:56.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Sari, Senator
Sessions has
described the attorney general's
position

41:58.783 --> 42:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as, he or she set the tone for
law enforcement
in America.

42:03.354 --> 42:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we have any idea what his
tone might be
based on his actions as senator?

42:07.658 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARI HORWITZ: You know, it's
hard to say how
he will be as attorney general,
but civil

42:11.629 --> 42:13.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rights groups are very
concerned.

42:13.765 --> 42:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is what we have seen in
the last
couple of days, the NAACP
Staging a sit-in

42:18.336 --> 42:26.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Mobile, Alabama, six people
arrested, the
ACLU today coming out with a big
report critical

42:26.210 --> 42:28.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Jeff Sessions.

42:28.045 --> 42:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't take a position a
candidate, for
or against, but very critical,
because they're

42:31.482 --> 42:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worried about what he will be
like as attorney
general, especially in the area
of civil rights.

42:37.388 --> 42:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're worried about the Civil
Rights Division
that under Eric Holder and
Loretta Lynch enforced

42:42.360 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strongly the Voting Rights Act
and oversight
of police departments.

42:47.965 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Justice Department in the
last couple
years has sued many police
departments across

42:52.537 --> 42:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America and forced reforms in
civil liberties
for police departments.

42:58.476 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have sued two states,
specifically
North Carolina and Texas, on the
Voting Rights

43:03.381 --> 43:05.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Sari Horwitz of
The Washington
Post, and John Sharp from the
Alabama Media

43:07.518 --> 43:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Group, thank you so much.

43:15.460 --> 43:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: why some
engineers and
investors are making big bets to
develop a

43:24.168 --> 43:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new generation of nuclear
reactors.

43:27.371 --> 43:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story.

43:29.173 --> 43:34.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a co-production with our
friends at
PBS "NOVA" tied to the January
11 documentary

43:34.779 --> 43:36.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"The Nuclear Option."

43:36.147 --> 43:39.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His story is part of our weekly
series the
Leading Edge.

43:39.417 --> 43:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is where
nuclear power
began.

43:43.821 --> 43:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome to the Idaho National
Laboratory.

43:46.257 --> 43:51.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It covers a vast swathe of high
desert nearly
the size of Rhode Island.

43:51.562 --> 43:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is dotted with experimental
nuclear reactors
that wrote the textbooks on how
to generate

43:56.300 --> 43:59.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
power by splitting atoms.

43:59.237 --> 44:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now a new chapter is being
written here.

44:01.606 --> 44:03.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK PETERS, Director, Idaho
National Laboratory:
If we're going to mitigate
climate change,

44:04.008 --> 44:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have to think about how to
develop new
nuclear.

44:07.478 --> 44:12.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Laboratory
director Mark Peters
says concerns about climate
change have brought

44:12.617 --> 44:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his industry out of a long
nuclear winter.

44:15.786 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK PETERS: We're restarting
and testing
infrastructure to start to
develop the next

44:19.156 --> 44:20.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generation of nuclear power.

44:20.992 --> 44:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm just incredibly excited
about the fact
that we're finally starting to
get a public

44:24.195 --> 44:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dialogue going now that it's
important to
build the next generation.

44:26.764 --> 44:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Bush and
Obama administrations
and Congress have concurred on
that point.

44:32.970 --> 44:39.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Together, they authorized tens
of billions
in loan guarantees for nuclear
plant construction,

44:39.377 --> 44:44.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tens of millions in funding
to develop
what's known as Generation IV
technology.

44:44.649 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK PETERS: Generation IV are
future reactors
that are based on different
concepts, different

44:49.854 --> 44:51.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
core designs, different
coolants.

44:51.756 --> 44:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And perhaps his
most promising
client is an innovator from
another industry.

44:57.929 --> 45:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Microsoft founder Bill Gates is
among a handful
of entrepreneurs with seemingly
bottomless

45:03.301 --> 45:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pockets making big bets on
nuclear power.

45:06.537 --> 45:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a 2010 TED Talk, he announced
he had co-founded
a company called TerraPower.

45:12.677 --> 45:17.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His partner is his former chief
technology
officer at Microsoft, Nathan
Myhrvold.

45:17.882 --> 45:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN MYHRVOLD, TerraPower: We
need to have
base load carbon-free power, and
nuclear is

45:24.255 --> 45:28.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a great example of something
that is base
load carbon-free power.

45:28.960 --> 45:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Base load means seven by 24, day
and night,
whenever, it's going to be
there.

45:34.732 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: TerraPower's
reactor uses a
design that dates back to the
first ever nuclear

45:39.704 --> 45:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power plant, built here in
Idaho.

45:42.873 --> 45:47.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It illuminated its first
lightbulbs in 1951.

45:48.012 --> 45:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an entirely different
design than the
vast majority of nuclear
reactors currently

45:52.984 --> 45:55.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
operating.

45:55.620 --> 46:02.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fuel wasn't cooled with
water, but, rather,
liquid metal, sodium mixed with
potassium,

46:02.126 --> 46:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has a lower melting point,
absorbs more
heat, and has a much higher
boiling point

46:07.265 --> 46:09.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than water.

46:09.600 --> 46:15.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had some inherent safety
advantages over
water-cooled reactors, which
cannot safely

46:15.172 --> 46:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shut down without electricity
from the grid
to keep cooling pumps running.

46:20.111 --> 46:23.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is what happened at
Fukushima in 2011.

46:23.414 --> 46:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An earthquake and tsunami caused
a station
blackout that also destroyed
backup generators

46:29.987 --> 46:31.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and batteries.

46:31.455 --> 46:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The reactors overheated and
three melted down.

46:34.992 --> 46:38.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It's now about five minutes
until test
time.

46:38.129 --> 46:43.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Twenty-five years
earlier in
Idaho, engineers staged a
prescient demonstration

46:43.668 --> 46:47.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Fukushima scenario in a
sodium reactor.

46:47.872 --> 46:50.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They deliberately shut off the
coolant flow.

46:50.241 --> 46:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a water-cooled reactor, like
Fukushima,
this would have caused an
explosion, but this

46:56.447 --> 46:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reactor safely shut itself down.

46:59.083 --> 47:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK PETERS: It reaches a
certain temperature,
and the reaction automatically
shuts down,

47:03.087 --> 47:04.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the reactor cools down by
itself.

47:04.989 --> 47:10.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Sodium reactors
do not need
the equivalent of premium gas,
refined or

47:10.528 --> 47:12.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enriched uranium.

47:12.663 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, TerraPower says it can
run its reactors
on the leftovers from
enrichment, depleted

47:18.235 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
uranium.

47:20.037 --> 47:24.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The biggest stockpile in the
U.S. is here
in Paducah, Kentucky, at a
uranium enrichment

47:24.809 --> 47:26.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plant.

47:26.644 --> 47:30.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: With our
reactors, Paducah,
Kentucky becomes the energy
capital of the

47:30.281 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, because Paducah
alone has enough
of this low-level nuclear waste,
the depleted

47:36.687 --> 47:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uranium, that we could run all
of America's
electricity needs for 750 years.

47:44.061 --> 47:48.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This is a model of the
Navy's first nuclear-powered
submarine, the Nautilus.

47:48.933 --> 47:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The seeds of the
decline for
liquid metal reactors were
planted by Admiral

47:54.105 --> 47:57.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hyman Rickover, the father of
the nuclear
Navy.

47:57.274 --> 48:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This is the reactor or the
atomic pile.

48:00.444 --> 48:02.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is uranium in here.

48:02.179 --> 48:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He selected
nuclear reactors
cooled with water to propel the
Nautilus,

48:06.650 --> 48:08.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first nuclear-powered
submarine.

48:08.986 --> 48:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For utilities, adapting the
nuclear Navy technology
for use on land offered the
fastest path to

48:15.826 --> 48:17.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market.

48:17.495 --> 48:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Water-cooled nuclear reactors
quickly became
the norm all over the world.

48:20.965 --> 48:26.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN LYMAN, Union of Concerned
Scientists:
I think that there was a victory
on the merits

48:26.370 --> 48:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, and the other reactor
designs did have
the opportunity to prove
themselves, and they

48:31.575 --> 48:33.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fell short.

48:33.277 --> 48:36.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Physicist Edwin
Lyman is with
the Union of Concerned
Scientists.

48:36.981 --> 48:41.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the promise of this new
generation
of nukes should be tempered by
the uncertainties.

48:41.952 --> 48:49.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EDWIN LYMAN: Some
non-water-cooled systems
have a lower risk of certain
types of accident,

48:49.260 --> 48:54.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they have greater risks of
other kinds
of accidents, or they introduce
other security

48:54.632 --> 48:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or safety issues, so there's
really no free
lunch here.

48:58.135 --> 49:02.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But the private
sector is apparently
not dissuaded.

49:02.072 --> 49:09.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A D.C.-based think tank, Third
Way, found
more than 40 startups across the
U.S. developing

49:09.113 --> 49:12.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
advanced nuclear power designs.

49:12.449 --> 49:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These atomic business plans have
lured more
than a billion dollars in
investment.

49:16.587 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE DEWAN, Transatomic Power:
I think a
lot of it might just be the
changing demographics

49:19.924 --> 49:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of nuclear engineers, that now
there are a
large number of young nuclear
engineers who

49:24.962 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, I have a really good
idea.

49:26.831 --> 49:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to raise some funding.

49:28.165 --> 49:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to see if I can do
this on my own.

49:31.602 --> 49:33.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much do you have to worry
about free fluorine?

49:33.470 --> 49:38.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Leslie Dewan is
one of the
young entrepreneurs leading this
revolution.

49:39.009 --> 49:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She became enamored with some
nuclear technology
first developed 50 years ago at
the Oak Ridge

49:44.181 --> 49:46.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Laboratory.

49:46.350 --> 49:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's called a molten salt
reactor, not table
salt, liquid fluoride salts.

49:51.956 --> 49:57.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLIE DEWAN: A molten salt
reactor uses liquid
fuel, rather than solid fuel.

49:57.328 --> 50:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Having uranium
dissolved in
liquid offers some safety
advantages.

50:02.700 --> 50:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the fuel gets too hot, the
liquid expands,
and the uranium atoms become too
dispersed

50:08.372 --> 50:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to maintain a nuclear chain
reaction.

50:10.908 --> 50:13.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It shuts itself down.

50:13.611 --> 50:19.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the case of a station
blackout, like
Fukushima, the liquid fuel
drains into a larger

50:19.149 --> 50:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tank, where it cools down
passively, no electricity
needed.

50:24.521 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Oak Ridge, they successfully
ran and tested
a molten salt reactor for four
years, and

50:29.927 --> 50:31.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it worked.

50:31.795 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But building a reactor that can
withstand
something as corrosive as a very
hot bath

50:36.567 --> 50:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of salt is a huge engineering
challenge.

50:39.670 --> 50:43.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At Oak Ridge, the funding ended
before they
could work on that.

50:43.807 --> 50:49.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the corrosion problem is the
focus of
early testing for Leslie Dewan's
startup company,

50:50.014 --> 50:51.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Transatomic.

50:51.849 --> 50:56.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE DEWAN: We can make
something that works
for five years, that works for
10 years.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, that, we certainly know.

50:58.789 --> 51:03.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we are trying to figure out
now is whether
we can use newer materials or
new methods

51:03.560 --> 51:09.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of corrosion control to extend
the lifetime
of the facility, because,
ultimately, we care

51:09.233 --> 51:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about making this low-cost.

51:11.535 --> 51:15.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have to replace your key
components
every 10 years, it's not going
to be cheaper

51:15.306 --> 51:16.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than coal.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it's not cheaper than
coal, then it's
not worth doing.

51:18.442 --> 51:23.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Without a tax, or
a cap, on
carbon emissions, matching the
cost of fossil

51:23.847 --> 51:28.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fuels will likely be an
impossible order for
these new nuclear designs.

51:28.852 --> 51:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWIN LYMAN: We don't put a lot
of stock in
seeing an alternative to a
water-cooled reactor

51:34.558 --> 51:40.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being developed anytime soon,
certainly not
quickly enough to make a dent in
the greenhouse

51:40.397 --> 51:41.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gas problem.

51:41.899 --> 51:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, in Idaho,
they are pressing
forward with urgency.

51:45.569 --> 51:50.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the U.S., there are currently
about 100
nuclear reactors in operation.

51:50.174 --> 51:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The majority of them are slated
for retirement
in the 2030s.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What will replace them?

51:56.046 --> 51:57.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wind and solar?

51:57.648 --> 52:01.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not without a breakthrough in
battery technology
to store power on the grid.

52:01.919 --> 52:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: The fate of the
whole planet
depends on us renewing our
energy system with

52:08.392 --> 52:11.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
renewables and with nuclear.

52:11.829 --> 52:17.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we step back from that,
we are going
to create a tremendous problem
for future

52:17.468 --> 52:19.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
generations.

52:19.303 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Worries about
waste, weapons
proliferation and safety nearly
derailed nuclear

52:23.574 --> 52:25.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
energy in the past.

52:25.476 --> 52:31.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the quest to meet rising
demand for energy,
without wrecking the planet, has
put new nuclear

52:31.181 --> 52:34.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
technology back on the agenda.

52:34.752 --> 52:41.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," at the
Idaho National Laboratory.

52:41.425 --> 52:48.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: And that's the
"NewsHour"
for tonight.

52:48.866 --> 52:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And...

52:49.867 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: I'm Alison
Stewart.

52:50.868 --> 52:51.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:51.869 --> 52:52.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sorry.

52:52.870 --> 52:53.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I stepped on you.

52:53.871 --> 52:55.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening, when I sit down at the
White house

52:57.374 --> 52:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Vice President Biden.

52:59.443 --> 53:09.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "NewsHour,"
thank you,
and good night.

53:09.553 --> 53:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "NewsHour,"
thank you,
and good night.
