JUDY WOODRUFF: Our lead
story tonight: James
Comey tells his story.

00:04.233 --> 00:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a prepared statement
to the Senate Intelligence
Committee, released one
day ahead of his hearing

00:11.166 --> 00:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tomorrow, the former
FBI director details his
personal conversations
with the president,

00:16.233 --> 00:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine in total, compared
with just two during three
years with President Obama.

00:21.933 --> 00:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey describes how Mr. Trump
asked repeatedly for a pledge
of personal loyalty, asked that

00:28.766 --> 00:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he drop the investigation
into General Michael
Flynn, and complained that
allegations surrounding

00:32.933 --> 00:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia were a cloud
over his presidency.

00:36.033 --> 00:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey also confirms that he told
President Trump that he wasn't
under investigation himself.

00:43.100 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Moments ago, Mr. Trump's
attorney responded in
a written statement,
quoting, "The president

00:49.200 --> 00:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is pleased," it says, "that
Mr. Comey has finally publicly
confirmed his private reports

00:54.066 --> 00:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the president wasn't
under investigation
in any Russia probe."

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And continuing, he wrote, "The
president feels completely
and totally vindicated."

01:03.133 --> 01:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, there is a
lot to unpack here.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to walk through
much of it now with reporter
Matt Apuzzo of The New York

01:08.400 --> 01:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Times and with John Carlin.

01:10.666 --> 01:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as assistant attorney
general for national security
from 2014 until October

01:16.433 --> 01:17.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of last year.

01:17.733 --> 01:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now an attorney
in private practice.

01:20.333 --> 01:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's start with their
first meeting on January 6
at Trump Tower in New York.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Matt, and -- we're going
-- I'm going to ask both of
you right now about this.

01:30.366 --> 01:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To set a little background,
it was New York City.

01:34.433 --> 01:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Comey was meeting the
president for the first time.

01:37.633 --> 01:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He showed up at Trump Tower
to meet the president's
national security team,
and then, privately,

01:44.633 --> 01:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he and the president-elect then
had a one-on-one session where
Comey shared with Mr. Trump

01:50.566 --> 01:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
information -- he called
it sensitive information
of a salacious nature
that had been gathered

01:56.666 --> 01:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as part of the
Russia investigation.

01:58.633 --> 02:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, with that background,
here is what James
Comey goes on to say.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They had a meeting.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here are some specifics now,
beginning with a dinner at the
White House three weeks later

02:09.866 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this is January 27,
after Mr. Trump is president.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On that day, the president
invited Comey over.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They dined alone
in the Green Room.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And here's how
Comey describes its.

02:21.700 --> 02:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says: "My instincts told me
that the one-on-one setting, and
the pretense that this was our

02:26.466 --> 02:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first discussion about my
position, meant the dinner was,
at least in part, an effort

02:31.400 --> 02:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have me ask for my job
and create some sort of
patronage relationship.

02:38.866 --> 02:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That concerned me
greatly, given the FBI's
traditionally independent
status in the executive

02:42.466 --> 02:44.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
branch.

02:44.533 --> 02:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I replied that I loved my work
and intended to stay and serve
out my 10-year term as director.

02:50.566 --> 02:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"And then, because the set-up
made me uneasy, I added that I
was not 'reliable' in the way

02:56.400 --> 03:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politicians use that word,
but he could always count
on me to tell him the truth.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few moments later, the
president said, 'I need
loyalty, I expect loyalty.'

03:07.600 --> 03:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't move, speak, or change
my facial expression in any
way during the awkward silence

03:12.300 --> 03:13.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that followed.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We simply looked at
each other in silence."

03:16.133 --> 03:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matt Apuzzo, how does
this square with the
reporting you have done?

03:19.500 --> 03:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT APUZZO, The New York Times:
Well, a lot of the -- a lot of
the details here, my colleagues

03:24.066 --> 03:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I have been reporting
out here over the
last several weeks.

03:28.400 --> 03:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's hard to overstate just
the extraordinary nature of
the portrait we're seeing here.

03:33.066 --> 03:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're really getting -- we're
really getting the backstory
to the Jim Comey firing.

03:37.533 --> 03:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing a president who
was preoccupied with, as you
said, getting the cloud lifted,

03:42.433 --> 03:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cloud of this Russia
investigation that was -- become
a real liability for the Trump

03:48.300 --> 03:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
administration from day one.

03:51.833 --> 03:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the idea that at
this private dinner that
the president starts
their relationship by

03:56.633 --> 04:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asking for this loyalty pledge,
you can -- you just read these
memos, you can see Comey,

04:01.233 --> 04:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just his anxiety
here in the words.

04:04.833 --> 04:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just the uncomfortable
-- you know, the discomfort
he has is palpable.

04:09.633 --> 04:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see Trump getting
more and more frustrated that,
you know, why is this guy

04:14.066 --> 04:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not doing what I'm asking?

04:16.133 --> 04:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Carlin, from
your perspective, what is the
significance of this exchange

04:19.500 --> 04:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the president
asking for loyalty?

04:21.933 --> 04:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN, Former Justice
Department Official:
Well, the FBI has a
unique institutional role,

04:27.233 --> 04:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as does the
Department of Justice.

04:29.933 --> 04:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, because both the FBI and
prosecutors in the Department
of Justice may be called

04:36.966 --> 04:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upon to investigate potential
criminal activity by members of
the president's party, by actual

04:43.100 --> 04:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of the
administration, and in some
circumstances investigate
conduct of a president

04:50.133 --> 04:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him or herself, there's been
a history where the department
has attempted to shield itself

04:53.533 --> 04:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from political interference.

04:55.566 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there have been times in
that history where maintaining
that independence has been

05:00.866 --> 05:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particularly fraught.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

05:03.766 --> 05:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: In my tenure as
chief of staff at the FBI, and
in my time at the department,

05:07.100 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can't recall something
quite like this.

05:09.833 --> 05:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I just
want to pick up on that, later
on in that January 27 dinner,

05:14.533 --> 05:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone with the president
in the White House in the
green room, Mr. Comey writes.

05:18.933 --> 05:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He says: "He then
said, 'I need loyalty.'

05:21.600 --> 05:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I replied, 'You will always
get honesty from me.'

05:24.900 --> 05:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He paused and then said, 'That's
what I want, honest loyalty.'

05:28.500 --> 05:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I paused, and then said,
'You will get that from me.'"

05:32.066 --> 05:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something, John
Carlin, that was appropriate?

05:35.933 --> 05:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, you can
see how the president's
demanding loyalty, that
might be appropriate

05:43.700 --> 05:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in some other context
of a political campaign,
or even other parts
of the administration.

05:50.700 --> 05:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Director Comey is very
focused, it look likes in that
exchange, and understands the

05:56.900 --> 05:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unique independence of the
role of the FBI director.

05:58.966 --> 06:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason why the statute
was changed so that the FBI
director's term of years is

06:05.366 --> 06:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 years designed to cut across
administrations to ensure that
the president who appointed

06:10.766 --> 06:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the director, that the
director would outlast the
tenure of that president.

06:14.700 --> 06:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so Director Comey, I
think, is trying to explain
in this awkward context why he

06:21.633 --> 06:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be honest, not disloyal in
some sense, but loyal ultimately
to the Constitution and

06:29.900 --> 06:31.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, now I want
to turn both of you to this
-- I think it was their next

06:33.733 --> 06:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting, February the 14th, in
a meeting in the Oval Office.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this time it was with
the president, the vice
president, the attorney general,

06:40.800 --> 06:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
several other senior
administration officials.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of that meeting,
the president asked everyone
to leave, except for Comey.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And according to Mr. Comey's
statement, Mr. Trump turned
back to the subject of General

06:53.200 --> 06:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Flynn, who had been
fired just the day before, and
he said -- quote -- "'I hope

06:57.966 --> 07:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you can see your way
clear to letting this
go, to letting Flynn go.

07:02.666 --> 07:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is a good guy.

07:03.766 --> 07:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I hope you can let this go.'"

07:05.766 --> 07:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Comey writes: "I replied
only that 'he is a good guy.'

07:09.833 --> 07:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I did not say I
would 'let this go.'"

07:13.300 --> 07:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matt Apuzzo, how does
that square with what
you have reported?

07:16.733 --> 07:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: My colleague
Michael Schmidt broke that
exchange a few weeks ago.

07:23.733 --> 07:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's no less -- it's no
less remarkable seeing it in
that full context, seeing the

07:30.500 --> 07:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president ask everybody to
leave the Oval Office and speak
alone with the head of the

07:34.433 --> 07:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FBI and say, you
know, let Flynn go.

07:41.466 --> 07:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just the very nature of we --
people -- we don't have to be
in Washington to understand

07:43.900 --> 07:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why that makes us
feel uncomfortable.

07:46.833 --> 07:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, anybody who has ever
fought a ticket in court, you
know, knows that they don't

07:53.766 --> 07:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - they don't want to feel
like the criminal justice system
is rigged for people who are

07:57.033 --> 08:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friendly with the politicians.

08:00.300 --> 08:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so if you're at the
FBI, yes, you are part
of the administration.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're part of the
Department of Justice.

08:07.266 --> 08:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they just don't see
themselves as working
for the president when
it comes to criminal

08:11.066 --> 08:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
justice stuff, and, as John
said, certainly not when the
investigation touches on the

08:16.933 --> 08:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president's own associates.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, continuing
that now, this is afterward,
the same day, February 14.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comey writes he spoke with the
attorney general in person.

08:26.333 --> 08:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "I took the opportunity
to implore the attorney
general to prevent any future

08:33.266 --> 08:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
direct communication between
me and the president - -
between the president and me.

08:37.066 --> 08:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I told the A.G. what had just
happened -- him being asked to
leave" -- because the attorney

08:44.066 --> 08:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general was one of those who
had been asked the leave the
Oval Office -- "while the FBI

08:47.533 --> 08:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
director, who reports to
the A.G., remained behind."

08:51.133 --> 08:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said: "That was inappropriate
and should never happen.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did not reply."

08:56.100 --> 08:58.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
John Carlin, how
do we read this?

08:58.166 --> 09:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: I will tell
you, there have been
instances before, let's
say, in a terrorism

09:04.633 --> 09:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incident or a major shooting, in
my experience, where the White
House would sometimes reach

09:08.133 --> 09:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out directly to the FBI.

09:10.700 --> 09:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it raised concerns, even
when that was the context, and
there were usual media calls

09:17.700 --> 09:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over to the attorney general to
ensure that the department was
aware of the contact directly

09:22.266 --> 09:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with the White House
or with immediate
aides to the president.

09:25.100 --> 09:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to have the president of
the United States order people
out of the room in order -- you

09:32.033 --> 09:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, if true, according to this
account -- in order to implore
the director of the FBI to

09:37.533 --> 09:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drop an investigation of
a friend or associate,
that's the core of why
many of our rules and

09:44.100 --> 09:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
customs were in place, was to
prevent exactly that type of
conversation or interference

09:50.033 --> 09:51.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from occurring.

09:51.566 --> 09:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So now, here we
are, a month-and-a-half later.

09:54.233 --> 09:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is March the 30th.

09:55.466 --> 09:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president phones
Jim Comey at the FBI.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He repeats the idea of a cloud
over his administration because
of the Russia investigation.

10:05.966 --> 10:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "He said he had
nothing to do with Russia, had
not been involved with hookers

10:11.433 --> 10:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Russia, and had always
assumed he was being
recorded when in Russia.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He asked what we could
do to 'lift the cloud.'"

10:18.600 --> 10:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Matt Apuzzo, we're
back to that same scenario,
back and forth, where
the president is asking

10:24.733 --> 10:26.966 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the FBI director
to do something.

10:26.966 --> 10:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Yes.

10:28.966 --> 10:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, look, you can see
why Donald Trump might
be frustrated, right?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just setting aside the fact
that he's the president, if
you have been told you are not

10:39.066 --> 10:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under investigation personally,
but yet your administration
can't escape the cloud of this

10:46.100 --> 10:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation, and you kind
of just want it to be over,
you can see why you would say,

10:49.666 --> 10:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hey, what do I have to
do to make this go away?

10:52.600 --> 10:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If I'm not under investigation,
why can't you just say that?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a very human response.

10:57.766 --> 11:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as John said, there's
a reason, and there's
a process that you're
supposed to go through

11:01.766 --> 11:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you reach out
on stuff like this.

11:03.733 --> 11:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, and just
finally, John, we're not showing
anymore graphics from the

11:09.500 --> 11:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statement, but it was
on March the 30th.

11:11.866 --> 11:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was another
phone call where the
president again called,
complaining about the cloud

11:15.433 --> 11:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over his presidency.

11:17.400 --> 11:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in that conversation,
he said: "If there were some
satellite associates of his who

11:24.133 --> 11:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did something wrong, it would
be good to find that out, but
that he hadn't done anything

11:28.766 --> 11:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong and hoped I would find
a way to get it out there."

11:30.833 --> 11:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he called Mr. Comey
again on April the 11th, and
talked about loyalty, back and

11:37.200 --> 11:39.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "I have been very
loyal to you," and, in essence,
saying, will you be loyal

11:42.800 --> 11:44.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to me?

11:44.266 --> 11:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, "At this
point, I didn't answer him."

11:46.733 --> 11:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you also, today, finally
now, John Carlin, have
the president's attorney
saying the president

11:51.433 --> 11:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feels vindicated.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, I think
in those conversations and
in that back-and-forth,
you also had Director

12:01.333 --> 12:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey informing the president,
according to this opening
statement, that he had recounted

12:08.533 --> 12:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their previous conversation
to the then-acting deputy
attorney general, Dana Boente.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:15.633 --> 12:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: And when
the president called, I
think, the second time,
the president referenced

12:18.533 --> 12:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and said, should I reach out?

12:20.933 --> 12:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it sounds like Director
Comey tried to say yes,
you should, through
White House counsel.

12:24.433 --> 12:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea of making a --
potentially making public the
results of an investigation, the

12:32.433 --> 12:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appropriate channel, the one
that's set up, there's actually
a memorandum on White House

12:36.400 --> 12:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contacts that's designed to
ensure that that type of contact
takes place lawyer to lawyer,

12:43.866 --> 12:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House counsel to
deputy attorney general,
to avoid either the
actuality of interference

12:47.133 --> 12:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with an investigation
or the appearance.

12:50.966 --> 12:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can see this kind
of confused back-and-forth.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, the most troubling of
the exchanges that are detailed
-- and the rest do provide

12:58.366 --> 13:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
context for it -- would
be the direct request
to end an investigation
of an associate, if

13:05.200 --> 13:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
true, related to the
investigation of Flynn.

13:08.266 --> 13:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Matt Apuzzo,
just finally, very quickly,
the fact that Director Comey

13:15.133 --> 13:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made these notes immediately
after each one of these meetings
or phone calls, I think,

13:19.533 --> 13:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
adds to the remarkable
nature of all this.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: That's right.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you have a you have an
FBI director who clearly was
so uncomfortable with these

13:27.266 --> 13:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interactions, he felt like
he had to document them,
and not just document them.

13:30.366 --> 13:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's like, this is where
he was sitting and this is where
he was sitting, and I walked

13:33.900 --> 13:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out the door near the
grandfather clock, and
then, halfway through,
this guy knocked on

13:37.800 --> 13:39.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the door.

13:39.900 --> 13:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it is really detailed
stuff that is clearly intended
for future consultation and

13:44.966 --> 13:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say, this isn't
just my memory.

13:46.233 --> 13:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I sat down and did
this in real time.

13:48.166 --> 13:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
point out once again the
president's attorney has issued

13:51.300 --> 13:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a statement today saying the
president feels vindicated,
that, he, in essence, thanked

13:58.800 --> 14:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Comey for repeating
the fact, he said, that
the president himself
wasn't under investigation.

14:04.033 --> 14:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So this will clearly continue.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to hear from
Mr. Comey tomorrow himself.

14:08.866 --> 14:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Carlin, Matt Apuzzo,
thank you very much.

14:11.366 --> 14:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: Thank you.

14:12.366 --> 14:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Thank you.
