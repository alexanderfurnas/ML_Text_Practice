FIRST OF ALL A CHUNK OF ICE THE

00:32.033 --> 00:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIZE OF DELAWARE SEEMS ALMOST

00:33.666 --> 00:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT OUR HEADS

00:36.000 --> 00:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND, BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY A

00:37.400 --> 00:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALL PIECE WHEN YOU THINK OF

00:39.500 --> 00:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SIZE OF ANTARCTICA.

00:41.433 --> 00:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, IT IS AND IT'S EVEN JUST

00:43.633 --> 00:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SMALL PIECE, HARI, OF THE

00:45.966 --> 00:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARSEN SEA ICE SHELF THAT

00:48.100 --> 00:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BREAKING OFF OF.

00:49.766 --> 00:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LARSEN SEA IS A FLOATING

00:52.333 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SLAB OF ICE THE SIZE OF VERMONT

00:55.500 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NEW HAMPSHIRE COMBINED AND

00:57.733 --> 01:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS A RIFT THAT

01:01.000 --> 01:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN GROWING YEARS NOW,

01:02.566 --> 01:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS YEAR REALLY ACCELERATED.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU SAID, IT'S ABOUT 15

01:06.966 --> 01:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES WIDE, IT... AND IT'S BEEN

01:09.533 --> 01:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY GOING TO SLICE A BIG

01:14.300 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHUNK OF ICE OFF THE ICE SHELF

01:16.566 --> 01:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT CHUNK WILL BE THE SIZE

01:18.333 --> 01:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DELAWARE.

01:19.866 --> 01:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE HAVE A PICTURE OF ONE OF

01:21.133 --> 01:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CRACKS THAT ARE GOING

01:22.300 --> 01:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH.

01:23.466 --> 01:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING

01:24.800 --> 01:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND STUDYING AND TRYING TO GET

01:25.966 --> 01:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT SOME OF THESE CRACKS FOR A

01:27.033 --> 01:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG TIME.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DEEP DOES IT GO DOWN AND

01:29.600 --> 01:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY ARE THEY SO CONCERNED?

01:31.533 --> 01:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE CRACK IN LARSEN SEA,

01:33.066 --> 01:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE LARSEN SEA MEETS THE SEA,

01:35.500 --> 01:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ABOUT 600 FEET THICK.

01:37.833 --> 01:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MOST OF THAT IS UNDER WATER.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S AN ICE CLIFF OF ABOUT

01:42.000 --> 01:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
60 FEET THAT TOWERS ABOVE THE

01:43.633 --> 01:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAVES.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE CRACK GOES ABOUT AT

01:46.900 --> 01:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST 600 FEET.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THIS ICEBERG GOES, THE WORRY

01:50.400 --> 01:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THE WHOLE ICE SHELF

01:52.200 --> 01:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT COLLAPSE AS OTHER ICE

01:53.700 --> 01:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHELVES ON THE ANTARTICA

01:55.766 --> 01:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENINSULA HAVE ALREADY

01:57.100 --> 01:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLAPSED.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE SHELVES THERE AND ELSEWHERE

02:00.866 --> 02:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE REALLY KIND OF CANARIES IN

02:02.966 --> 02:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COAL MINE, THEY'RE A SIGN OF

02:06.766 --> 02:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER, THAT

02:09.233 --> 02:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTARTICA IS MELTING FASTER THAN

02:10.833 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS HAD EXPECTED.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE

02:14.800 --> 02:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT THE ICE IS ALREADY IN

02:16.166 --> 02:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WATER AND IT'S JUST MELTING

02:17.333 --> 02:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A GLASS OF WATER, WE'RE

02:19.033 --> 02:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY ADDING NEW ICE CUBES TO

02:20.266 --> 02:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT GLASS, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES

02:21.766 --> 02:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEA LEVEL RISE?

02:23.300 --> 02:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YES.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THE PERFECT ANALOGY.

02:25.866 --> 02:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ICE, THE LARSON SEA ICE

02:28.200 --> 02:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHELF IS FLOATING, IT IS LIKE AN

02:29.700 --> 02:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ICE CUBE IN A GLASS OF WATER.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN IF ALL OF IT COLLAPSES,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, ITSELF, DOES NOT ADD TO

02:36.000 --> 02:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEA LEVEL.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE THING ABOUT ICE SHELVES

02:39.766 --> 02:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT THEY FUNCTION LIKE

02:41.633 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORKS, THEY'RE BOTTLING UP A

02:43.366 --> 02:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH LARGER AMOUNT ICE THAT'S ON

02:45.700 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GROUND, ON THE LAND, IN THIS

02:47.200 --> 02:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE, BEHIND THEM.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN... THAT'S THE GLACIERS

02:51.133 --> 02:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ARE CARRYING ICE FROM THE

02:52.866 --> 02:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERIOR OF ANTARTICA TOWARDS

02:54.666 --> 02:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEA.

02:56.066 --> 02:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ICE SHELVES ARE SORT OF THE

02:57.733 --> 02:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOATING ENDS OF THE GLACIERS.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHEN THAT FLOW INCREASES,

03:01.966 --> 03:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ICE IS FALLING INTO THE SEA

03:04.566 --> 03:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RAISING SEA LEVEL.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE ARTICLE

03:07.633 --> 03:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT TALKS ABOUT HOW SCIENTISTS

03:09.200 --> 03:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASURE WHAT'S HAPPENING UNDER

03:10.833 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:19.433 --> 03:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE BIG THING IN RECENT YEARS

03:23.300 --> 03:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT WARMER OCEAN WATER, AND

03:24.900 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN I SAY WARM, WARMER, I DON'T

03:26.333 --> 03:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEAN REALLY WARM.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR, FIVE

03:29.333 --> 03:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING.

03:30.733 --> 03:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THINNING THEM FROM BELOW AND

03:43.366 --> 03:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE FLOATING ICE SHELVES HAS

04:12.766 --> 04:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASED BY A FACTOR OF 12 IN

THE PAST TWO DECADES.

04:16.300 --> 04:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHERE IN THE MID '90s THEY

04:17.833 --> 04:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE LOSING SIX BILLION TONS OF
