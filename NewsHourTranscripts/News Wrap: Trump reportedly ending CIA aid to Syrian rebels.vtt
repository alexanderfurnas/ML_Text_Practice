JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate
Republicans are trying
again to see if there
is a way forward on

00:04.366 --> 00:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care reform.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their latest bill to replace
Obamacare collapsed yesterday,
but party leaders say it may not

00:12.500 --> 00:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be dead yet, after a repeal-only
option also ran into opposition.

00:18.166 --> 00:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump called the
caucus to the White House today.

00:20.433 --> 00:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he is now ready
to act, and insisted that
inaction is not an option.

00:25.333 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Frankly, I don't
think we should leave town

00:29.833 --> 00:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
unless we have a health
insurance plan, unless
we can give our people
great health care,

00:36.666 --> 00:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because we're close.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're very close.

00:39.933 --> 00:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any senator who votes against
starting debate is really
telling America that you're fine

00:46.366 --> 00:48.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Obamacare.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Afterward,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell said he still aims

00:52.133 --> 00:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to hold a vote next week,
but it's not clear on what.

00:55.733 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:57.733 --> 01:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I think we all agree
it's better to both repeal

01:00.233 --> 01:03.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and replace.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we could have
a vote on either.

01:06.433 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we end up voting on
repeal only, it will be fully
amendable on the Senate floor.

01:13.433 --> 01:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it were to pass without
any amendment at all, there's
a two-year delay before it

01:18.866 --> 01:21.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kicks in.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be
talking to two Republican
senators about the
state of play on health

01:23.666 --> 01:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care reform after
the news summary.

01:26.433 --> 01:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Separately, there's word
that President Trump is
ending a CIA program to
arm and train moderate

01:32.733 --> 01:34.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rebels in Syria.

01:34.833 --> 01:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The goal was to fight the regime
of President Bashar al-Assad,
but it had only limited effects

01:40.466 --> 01:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after Russia intervened
to aid Assad.

01:43.300 --> 01:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post reports
the president made the decision
nearly a month ago, before

01:48.066 --> 01:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he met with Russian's President
Putin at the G20 summit.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afterward, the U.S. and
Russia announced a limited
cease-fire in Syria.

01:58.666 --> 02:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Post account says that
the aid decision is part of a
strategy to negotiate more such

02:02.400 --> 02:04.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deals.

02:04.366 --> 02:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran today stepped up its
defiant response to the latest
round of U.S. sanctions.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They target 18 individuals and
companies assisting the Iranian
ballistic missile program.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Tehran, President Hassan
Rouhani charged that the U.S.
measures are inconsistent with

02:21.233 --> 02:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 2016 nuclear deal.

02:23.033 --> 02:25.466 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And he warned of
reciprocal acts.

02:25.466 --> 02:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): If Americans
pass new sanctions

02:29.233 --> 02:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in any form, or under
any pretext in Congress
or elsewhere, the great
nation of Iran will

02:33.900 --> 02:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have an appropriate answer.

02:35.966 --> 02:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We won't ignore violations
by the United States, and
will stand up to them.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also, the head
of the hard-line Revolutionary
Guards warned that the U.S.

02:44.066 --> 02:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had better pull its military
forces back at least 1,000
kilometers, or 600 miles, from

02:51.033 --> 02:52.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iran.

02:52.966 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court has
issued a split ruling on
enforcing the president's travel

02:57.400 --> 02:59.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court today allowed the
administration to strictly
enforce a ban on refugees while

03:04.500 --> 03:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an appeal moves
through lower courts.

03:06.633 --> 03:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the justices expanded the
list of people from six mostly
Muslim nations who are allowed

03:12.266 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to visit the U.S.

03:14.633 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Justice Department is restoring
authority to local police to

03:19.466 --> 03:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
seize money and property
on suspicion they come
from criminal activity.

03:24.433 --> 03:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The assets can be taken
even without criminal
charges being brought.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration
had curbed the practice,
but Attorney General
Jeff Sessions today eased

03:34.433 --> 03:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the restrictions.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, tech and health
care stocks fueled a day of
record highs across the board.

03:42.166 --> 03:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 66 points
to close at 21640.

03:47.666 --> 03:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose 40, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 13.

03:51.666 --> 03:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Salem, Massachusetts,
today marked 325 years since
five women were hanged in the

03:59.400 --> 04:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
infamous witch trials.

04:01.533 --> 04:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were among 19 people
condemned and hanged for
witchcraft in Salem in 1692.

04:08.533 --> 04:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A descendant of one of them
said it brings justice to the
fact that they were wrongly

04:13.466 --> 04:14.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
accused.
