02:53.900 --> 02:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SAID THE PROBLEM FROM HIS

02:55.067 --> 02:57.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT OF VIEW IS THAT THE TRUMP

02:57.267 --> 02:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSITION TEAM DID NOT SUBMIT

02:58.533 --> 03:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OF THESE NAMES BEFORE THEY

03:00.533 --> 03:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE THEM PUBLIC.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAYS THAT'S WHAT USUALLY

03:03.367 --> 03:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENS.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CLEAR THESE NOMINEES BEFORE

03:06.000 --> 03:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PRESIDENT TO BE ACTUALLY

03:07.567 --> 03:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCES THEM.

03:08.933 --> 03:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THIS CASE, THE ETHICS OFFICE

03:10.067 --> 03:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THEY GOT THESE NAMES LATE

03:11.733 --> 03:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN SOME CASES THE ETHICS

03:13.633 --> 03:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICE SAYS THEY STILL DON'T

03:15.100 --> 03:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COMING UP WITHIN DAYS.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN THE POLITICS IS LESS

03:22.467 --> 03:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLICATED TO EXPLAIN.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> WHAT CAN THE DEMOCRATS DO.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HEARD SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER

03:36.933 --> 03:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY TODAY LET'S BE DELIBERATE

03:39.100 --> 03:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SLOW ABOUT THIS PROCESS.

03:40.767 --> 03:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO EITHER

03:42.533 --> 03:43.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLOCKING A NOMINEE OR CHANGING

03:43.967 --> 03:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SCHEDULE.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT, WHEN A SENATOR SAYS

03:46.967 --> 03:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S BE DELIBERATE, THAT OFTEN

03:49.400 --> 03:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANS LET'S USE ALL OF OUR

03:51.033 --> 03:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWERS TO LENGTHEN THE TIME IT

03:52.567 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKES TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY THING

03:54.900 --> 03:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN DO, HARI.

03:56.633 --> 03:57.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE VOTES TO

03:57.767 --> 04:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET THROUGH ALL OF THESE

04:00.100 --> 04:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEES.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY JUST HAVE A MAJORITY VOTE.

04:03.633 --> 04:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE 52 IN THE SENATE.

04:04.867 --> 04:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DEMOCRATS CAN DO IS TRY

04:06.333 --> 04:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND USE THE BULLY PULPIT PO TO
