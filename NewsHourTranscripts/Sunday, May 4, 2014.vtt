08:39.567 --> 08:41.800
BUILDING LIKE THIS IS AN

08:41.800 --> 08:42.900
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUT

08:42.900 --> 08:45.367
SOMETHING TO THE COMMUNITY I

08:45.367 --> 08:46.033
ADDITION TO MYSELF

08:46.033 --> 08:50.800
AS THE BUSINESSES AROUND ME AR

08:50.800 --> 08:52.200
GROWING AND BEING MORE

08:52.200 --> 08:54.033
SUCCESSFUL, MY BUSINESS IS MOR

08:54.033 --> 08:54.400
SUCCESSFUL

08:54.400 --> 08:55.700
THIS IS BASIC ECONOMICS.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.200
>> HE'S BEEN LAUDED BY THE CIT

08:57.200 --> 08:59.400
OF DENVER FOR HELPING TO REVIV

08:59.400 --> 09:00.467
A FEW NEIGHBORHOODS THERE.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.067
HE STARTED OUT REHABBING OLD

09:03.067 --> 09:04.800
THEATERS WHEN HE WAS A CONCERT

09:04.800 --> 09:05.467
PROMOTER

09:05.467 --> 09:07.700
THAT'S WHEN I FIRST INTERVIEWE

09:07.700 --> 09:07.833
HIM.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.600
HE BOUGHT THIS BUILDING IN 200

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
AND OPENED A COUPLE OF

09:10.800 --> 09:12.133
RESTAURANTS ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.933
HE DREAMED OF CONVERTING THE

09:13.933 --> 09:16.167
UPPER FLOORS INTO A LUXURY HOTEL

09:16.167 --> 09:17.800
BUT AS THE RESTAURANT STARTED TO

09:17.800 --> 09:20.333
ATTRACT CROWDS, THE HOTE

09:20.333 --> 09:21.500
PROJECT RAN INTO TROUBLE WIT

09:21.500 --> 09:23.600
CITY INSPECTORS AND HIS BUSINESS

09:23.600 --> 09:25.600
PLAN DERAILED.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.433
YOUR COMPANY WAS WOUNDED, BU

09:27.433 --> 09:29.300
WAS IT A MORTAL WOUND IN YOU

09:29.300 --> 09:29.600
OPINION?

09:29.600 --> 09:30.767
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.167
IT WAS A DISTRESSED PERIOD

09:33.167 --> 09:35.000
MANAGEABLE ISSUES, CURABLE

09:35.000 --> 09:35.733
ISSUES

09:35.733 --> 09:40.000
>> ONE REASON HE WAS OPTIMISTI

09:40.000 --> 09:41.633
IS THE RELATIONSHIP HE HAD WIT

09:41.633 --> 09:43.433
HIS BANK

09:43.433 --> 09:44.500
FIRST TIER BANK HAD PROVIDED

09:44.500 --> 09:48.167
MOST OF THE FINANCING FOR TH

09:48.167 --> 09:48.800
HOTEL.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.000
IT WAS SMALL SO TOP EXECUTIVES

09:51.000 --> 09:52.133
GOT INVOLVED

09:52.133 --> 09:53.567
THE BANK GAVE HIM MILLIONS O

09:53.567 --> 09:55.000
DOLLARS IN LOANS

09:55.000 --> 09:57.433
HE GAVE THE BANK ALL OF HI

09:57.433 --> 09:58.533
BUSINESS, CREDIT CAR

09:58.533 --> 10:01.500
TRANSACTIONS, CHECKING ACCOUNTS,

10:01.500 --> 10:01.667
EVERYTHING

10:01.667 --> 10:03.967
HE THOUGHT OF HIS BANKERS ALMOST

10:03.967 --> 10:06.300
AS IF THEY WERE HIS PARTNERS

10:06.300 --> 10:08.633
>> IF WE HAD A CASH FLOW

10:08.633 --> 10:10.700
PROBLEM, I'D GO TALK TO THE BANK

10:10.700 --> 10:13.433
PRESIDENT AND HE WOULD B

10:13.433 --> 10:14.267
ACCOMMODATING TO THAT BECAUS

10:14.267 --> 10:16.867
THEY HAD A VESTED INTEREST I

10:16.867 --> 10:17.700
MAKING SURE THAT THIS SMAL

10:17.700 --> 10:18.700
BUSINESS AND THEIR CUSTOMER WA

10:18.700 --> 10:19.133
SUCCESSFUL

10:19.133 --> 10:20.933
>> REMEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN

10:20.933 --> 10:22.100
THINGS WEREN'T GOING SO WELL

10:22.100 --> 10:23.167
YOU DIDN'T LOSE YOUR HOUSE

10:23.167 --> 10:24.967
YOU THINK POTTER WOULD HAVE LE

10:24.967 --> 10:25.933
YOU KEEP IT?

10:25.933 --> 10:27.800
>> IT'S THE WAGE GEORGE BAILEY

10:27.800 --> 10:29.800
DID BUSINESS IN THE FILM "IT'S A

10:29.800 --> 10:30.933
WONDERFUL LIFE."

10:30.933 --> 10:32.533
OLD FASHIONED PERSONAL BANKING

10:32.533 --> 10:35.600
WHEN JESSE WENT TO FIRST TIER TO

10:35.600 --> 10:37.633
TALK ABOUT A LOAN MODIFICATION

10:37.633 --> 10:39.400
TO DELAY PAYMENTS TO DEAL WITH

10:39.400 --> 10:40.733
THE PROBLEM AND GET THE BUSINESS

10:40.733 --> 10:42.900
BACK ON TRACK, THE BANK HA

10:42.900 --> 10:43.900
INCENTIVES TO BE FLEXIBLE.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.933
AT LEAST IT DID UNTIL TH

10:45.933 --> 10:47.467
FINANCIAL CRISIS CAME AND FIRS

10:47.467 --> 10:49.200
TIER FAILED.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.933
HUNDREDS OF BANKS WENT UNDER

10:50.933 --> 10:53.100
DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AN

10:53.100 --> 10:54.533
BUSINESSPEOPLE LIKE JESSE LOST

10:54.533 --> 10:56.300
THE BANKERS THEY'D BEEN DOIN

10:56.300 --> 10:58.700
BUSINESS WITH IN SOME CASES FO

10:58.700 --> 10:58.867
YEARS.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.133
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES DOIN

11:00.133 --> 11:02.100
BUSINESS WITH STRANGERS WH

11:02.100 --> 11:03.700
DIDN'T HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN

11:03.700 --> 11:06.167
MAKING SURE THEY WER

11:06.167 --> 11:06.700
SUCCESSFUL

11:06.700 --> 11:09.200
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT IN JANUARY

11:09.200 --> 11:11.233
2011 JESSE LEARNED THA

11:11.233 --> 11:12.333
REGULATOR HS SHUT DOWN FIRST

11:12.333 --> 11:13.900
TIER AND THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT

INSURANCE CORPORATION HAD TAKE

11:15.600 --> 11:16.067
OVER

11:16.067 --> 11:19.767
AND FROM THAT DAY ON, IT WAS A

11:19.767 --> 11:20.033
NIGHTMARE.

11:20.033 --> 11:22.767
AND FOR A WHILE, WE HA

11:22.767 --> 11:23.633
EMPLOYEES WHO COULDN'T CAS

11:23.633 --> 11:26.233
THEIR PAYCHECKS.

11:26.233 --> 11:29.833
IT WAS A MESS.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.900
>> MEANWHILE, HE WAS GETTING

11:31.900 --> 11:33.267
LETTERS ABOUT THE LOAN FOR THE

11:33.267 --> 11:35.733
HOTEL PROJECT FROM THE FDIC AN

11:35.733 --> 11:35.933
OTHERS

11:35.933 --> 11:37.233
EACH ONE LEFT HIM WITH A

11:37.233 --> 11:38.433
DIFFERENT IMPRESSION OF WHO WA

11:38.433 --> 11:40.433
IN CHARGE OF THE LOAN HE'D BEE

11:40.433 --> 11:41.400
TRYING TO MODIFY

11:41.400 --> 11:42.800
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO WRITE

11:42.800 --> 11:44.600
THE CHECKS TO.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.733
WE'D CHANGE THE ADDRESSES YO

11:45.733 --> 11:47.200
SEND THEM TO, THEY CHANG

11:47.200 --> 11:47.367
EVERYTHING

11:47.367 --> 11:48.867
EACH AND EVERY TIME WE'D HAVE TO

11:48.867 --> 11:50.300
GO THROUGH THIS FIRE DRILL WIT

11:50.300 --> 11:53.400
GETTING THINGS LIKE INSURANC

11:53.400 --> 11:54.967
CERTIFICATES CHANGED TO REFLEC

11:54.967 --> 11:56.400
NEW PEOPLE AND EACH TIME THA

11:56.400 --> 11:57.067
WOULD COST US MONEY.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.300
>> BY NOW THE FDIC WAS TRYING TO

11:59.300 --> 12:02.867
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH FIRST

12:02.867 --> 12:04.533
TIER'S ASSETS INCLUDING JESSE'

12:04.533 --> 12:05.000
LOAN

12:05.000 --> 12:08.033
>> WE HAD A STATUTORY OBLIGATION

12:08.033 --> 12:09.833
TO MAXIMIZE THE ASSETS

12:09.833 --> 12:11.900
>> THIS MAN RUNS THE DIVISIO

12:11.900 --> 12:13.600
THAT HANDLES THE ASSETS OF

12:13.600 --> 12:14.367
FAILED BANKS

12:14.367 --> 12:15.567
HE SAYS BECAUSE THERE WERE S

12:15.567 --> 12:17.467
MANY LOANS THEY HANDLED DURING

12:17.467 --> 12:20.900
THE CRISIS AND TO TRY TO

12:20.900 --> 12:22.133
MAXIMIZE WHAT YOU COULD GET FO

12:22.133 --> 12:23.600
THEM, HE AND HIS TEAM TURNED T

THE PRIVATE SECTOR INCLUDING

12:24.900 --> 12:27.400
HEDGE FUNDS AND REAL ESTAT

12:27.400 --> 12:27.667
FIRMS.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.367
THEY BECAME THE FDIC'S PARTNER

12:30.367 --> 12:33.233
ON MORE THAN $26 BILLION WORTH

12:33.233 --> 12:35.900
OF LOANS

THE MONEY THAT COMES IN FROM THE

12:40.000 --> 12:41.867
LOANS.

12:41.867 --> 12:43.100
THE FIRMS GET PAID MANAGEMEN

12:43.100 --> 12:44.267
FEES BECAUSE THEY COLLEC

12:44.267 --> 12:45.467
PAYMENTS, CHASE DOWN DEADBEATS

12:45.467 --> 12:47.933
AND DEAL WITH MODIFICATION

12:47.933 --> 12:48.733
REQUESTS LIKE JESSE'S.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.433
THEIR WAY SO THEY CAN DO WHA

12:51.433 --> 12:52.467
THEY'RE BEST AT DOING.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.400
>> A FIRM CALLED SABAL FINANCIAL

12:54.400 --> 12:57.067
WAS ONE OF THE FDIC'S PARTNERS

12:57.067 --> 12:58.567
IN JESSE'S LOAN.

12:58.567 --> 13:01.033
CEO PAT JACKSON SAYS HIS FIR

13:01.033 --> 13:02.400
DOESN'T DO BUSINESS LIKE A BANK.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.767
>> I DON'T HAVE A REGULATO

13:04.767 --> 13:06.300
LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER SAYING,

13:06.300 --> 13:09.100
HEY, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT THI

13:09.100 --> 13:09.567
WAY OR THAT WAY.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.300
>> DOES THAT MEAN YOU CAN BE A

13:11.300 --> 13:12.800
LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE WIT

13:12.800 --> 13:14.300
BORROWERS THAN A REGULATED BAN

13:14.300 --> 13:14.667
COULD?

13:14.667 --> 13:16.567
>> BANKS IN GENERAL STILL LOOK

13:16.567 --> 13:18.633
AT THEIR BORROWERS IS THAT I

13:18.633 --> 13:20.200
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP, I'M A

13:20.200 --> 13:21.767
COMMUNITY BANK AND THEY TAKE A

13:21.767 --> 13:24.133
DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ABOU

13:24.133 --> 13:26.067
COLLECTIONS THAN PERHAPS W

13:26.067 --> 13:26.300
WOULD.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.400
WE'RE SIMPLY LOOKING AT TH

13:27.400 --> 13:28.800
VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, THE

13:28.800 --> 13:32.967
ABILITY OF THE BORROWER TO PAY

13:32.967 --> 13:34.233
AND IT'S THAT SIMPLE

13:34.233 --> 13:36.567
>> FIRMS LIKE JACKSON'S HAVE

13:36.567 --> 13:38.700
ONLY ONE INCENTIVE, TO MAXIMIZ

13:38.700 --> 13:40.900
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY MAKE.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.467
JESSE BELIEVES THAT GAVE SABAL

13:43.467 --> 13:48.300
AND HIS PARTNER OAK TREE

13:48.300 --> 13:48.433
FINANCIAL TO FORECLOSE ON TH

13:48.433 --> 13:50.767
HOTEL BUILDING HE PUT UP A

14:00.000 --> 14:01.700
MISLED HIM AND INSTRUCTED HIM TO

14:01.700 --> 14:02.567
STOP MAKING PAYMENTS ON TH

14:02.567 --> 14:02.833
LOAN

14:02.833 --> 14:04.767

14:04.767 --> 14:11.700
LOANS NEEDED TO BE IN DEFAULT TO

14:11.700 --> 14:13.867
HAVE THEIR ATTENTION TO

14:13.867 --> 14:14.367
MODIFICATION REQUEST

14:14.367 --> 14:16.400
SO WE LET THE LOANS GO INT

14:16.400 --> 14:17.200
DEFAULT AT THEIR SUGGESTION.

DEFERRAL PERIOD AND THAT IT WA

14:23.967 --> 14:25.567
EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE

14:28.233 --> 14:32.200
ME INVOICES.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.867
AND I TRUSTED THEM, WHICH WAS

14:34.867 --> 14:35.067
MISTAKE.

14:37.267 --> 14:37.400
HAPPENS?

14:37.400 --> 14:38.933
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO ADVISE

14:38.933 --> 14:40.467
PEOPLE TO GET BEHIND ON THEI

LOANS?

ACTUAL DETAILS OF THIS

16:04.867 --> 16:05.567
PARTICULAR SITUATION, THANK YOU.

16:05.567 --> 16:08.233
>> HE TURNED THE CALL OVER T

16:08.233 --> 16:10.867
PAT AS IS PAT JACKSON OF SABAL

16:10.867 --> 16:11.167
FINANCIAL.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.367
ALL OF THE DETAILS ABOUT THE

16:12.367 --> 16:14.100
CASE THAT WE LEARNED DURING THAT

16:14.100 --> 16:15.367
CALL CAME FROM PAT JACKSON

16:15.367 --> 16:18.733
THE FDIC DIDN'T PROVIDE AN

16:18.733 --> 16:19.267
SPECIFIC INFORMATION

16:19.267 --> 16:20.633
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW HOW MAN

16:20.633 --> 16:22.933
BUSINESSES MAY BE IN JESSE'S

16:22.933 --> 16:24.633
SITUATION BECAUSE NOBODY'S

16:24.633 --> 16:25.367
KEEPING TRACK.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.600
THERE'S AT LEAST ONE OTHER

16:26.600 --> 16:32.533
BUSINESS IN DENVER WHEN SABAL TO

16:32.533 --> 16:33.733
FORECLOSE ON ITS PROPERTY IT

16:33.733 --> 16:36.767
LAID OFF DOZENS OF EMPLOYEES

16:36.767 --> 16:38.000
OTHERS TESTIFIED BEFORE TH

16:38.000 --> 16:39.133
HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES

16:39.133 --> 16:39.567
COMMITTEE.

16:39.567 --> 16:40.700
JESSE'S BUSINESS IS IN

16:40.700 --> 16:41.200
BANKRUPTCY COURT

16:41.200 --> 16:44.000
IS THAT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF

16:44.000 --> 16:46.400
2008 AND THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.367
>> I THINK THE FDIC'S VIEW O

16:48.367 --> 16:50.233
THAT IS WE TRIED TO DO AS GOOD A

16:50.233 --> 16:52.633
JOB AS WE CAN GIVEN OUR STATUE

16:52.633 --> 16:54.700
STORY MANDATE TO MAKE THIS WOR

16:54.700 --> 16:57.333
FOR EVERYBODY, BUT I THINK THE

16:57.333 --> 16:58.333
CONCEPT THAT THIS COULD HAVE

16:58.333 --> 17:01.133
BEEN A PAINLESS EXERCISE, IT'S

17:01.133 --> 17:02.433
PROBABLY JUST NOT GOING TO

17:02.433 --> 17:02.700
HAPPEN

17:02.700 --> 17:05.067
>> AS YOU'VE ALREADY SAID, EVE

17:05.067 --> 17:07.733
BEFORE THE FDIC'S INVOLVEMEN

17:07.733 --> 17:10.067
HERE, THERE WERE ISSUES.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.733
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT LOOK AT THIS

17:12.733 --> 17:14.400
AND SAY IT'S JESSE'S FAULT, NO

17:14.400 --> 17:16.467
OAK TREE'S FAULT

17:16.467 --> 17:17.700
OAK TREE'S JUST DOING WHAT THE

17:17.700 --> 17:18.000
DO

17:18.000 --> 17:19.900
>> THE BUSINESSES WOULDN'T B

17:19.900 --> 17:21.533
HERE WITHOUT ME.

17:21.533 --> 17:23.700
I BUILD THINGS

17:23.700 --> 17:25.400
THESE PEOPLE DON'T BUILD

17:25.400 --> 17:25.600
ANYTHING

17:25.600 --> 17:26.800
THEY'RE OUT THERE TAKING THING

17:26.800 --> 17:27.900
FROM PEOPLE THAT OTHER PEOPL

17:27.900 --> 17:28.367
HAVE BUILT

17:28.367 --> 17:30.867
>> IS THIS THE FDIC'S FAULT?

17:30.867 --> 17:34.833
IS THIS OAK TREE'S FAULT

17:34.833 --> 17:35.467
SABAL'S FAULT?

17:35.467 --> 17:38.000
>> I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF

17:38.000 --> 17:42.267
THE FDIC AND OAK TREE CAPITA

17:42.267 --> 17:43.467
AND SABAL.

17:43.467 --> 17:49.167
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE DISPLAY O

17:49.167 --> 17:50.367
AVARICE WITHOUT CONSCIENCE

17:50.367 --> 17:51.500
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE AND THAT'S A

17:51.500 --> 17:57.700
RESULT OF THE FDIC FAILING T

17:57.700 --> 17:59.700
APPROPRIATELY OVERSEE THEI

17:59.700 --> 18:00.367
PARTNER.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.433
FUNDAMENTALLY IF THIS IS HOW THE

18:02.433 --> 18:04.533
FDIC IS PROTECTING US, I DON'T

18:04.533 --> 18:05.833
NEED THESE KIND OF PROTECTIONS

18:05.833 --> 18:07.867
>> IT'S NOW UP TO A FEDERA

18:07.867 --> 18:09.667
BANKRUPTCY JUDGE TO DECIDE

18:09.667 --> 18:11.333
WHETHER JESSE KEEPS THE BUILDING

18:11.333 --> 18:12.900
OR LOSES IT TO THE HEDGE FUN

18:12.900 --> 18:13.567
AND REAL ESTATE FIRL

18:13.567 --> 18:14.000

18:32.000 --> 18:33.433
ON A STORY WE BROUGHT YO

18:33.433 --> 18:35.100
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, THE DEBAT

18:35.100 --> 18:37.100
ABOUT THE AUTHENTICITY OF

18:37.100 --> 18:40.600
DOCUMENT THAT SUGGESTS JESUS WAS

18:40.600 --> 18:41.033
MARRIED.

18:41.033 --> 18:43.700
WE'RE JOINED BY THE PROFESSOR OF

18:43.700 --> 18:45.267
RELIGION AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY

18:45.267 --> 18:47.233
WE WERE IN THESE EXACT CHAIR

18:47.233 --> 18:49.500
JUST BEFORE EASTER TALKING ABOUT

18:49.500 --> 18:50.967
THIS POTENTIAL DOCUMENT THAT

18:50.967 --> 18:52.467
COULD HAVE HUGE RAMIFICATION

18:52.467 --> 18:53.467
FOR THE CHURCH

18:53.467 --> 18:54.800
FIRST OF ALL, PEOPLE WHO DIDN'

18:54.800 --> 18:56.400
WATCH THAT EPISODE OR SEE IT

18:56.400 --> 18:58.267
ONLINE, WHAT'S THE DOCUMENT?

18:58.267 --> 19:01.200
>> THE DOCUMENT WAS OFFERED TO

19:01.200 --> 19:02.567
HARVARD UNIVERSITY A WHILE BACK,

19:02.567 --> 19:05.800
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.267
A SMALL FRAGMENT, A COPT I

19:10.267 --> 19:11.667
PAPYRUS OF JESUS REFERRING TO

19:11.667 --> 19:11.800
WIFE

19:11.800 --> 19:13.567
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME

19:13.567 --> 19:15.467
WAS SCIENTIFIC DATING THAT WAS

19:15.467 --> 19:17.700
PUTTING THIS IN THE SEVENTH OR

19:17.700 --> 19:18.467
EIGHTH CENTURY

19:18.467 --> 19:20.200
WE TALKED ABOUT TH

19:20.200 --> 19:21.000
RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.067
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

19:22.067 --> 19:24.567
IS REALLY MORE OLD FASHIONED

19:24.567 --> 19:27.633
ANALYSIS OF HANDWRITIN

19:27.633 --> 19:29.667
PALEOGRAPHY, STUFF LIKE THAT

19:29.667 --> 19:31.233
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED WERE THERE

19:31.233 --> 19:32.600
WERE OTHER DOCUMENTS IN TH

19:32.600 --> 19:34.700
COLLECTION THAT WERE OFFERED T

19:34.700 --> 19:34.967
HARVARD.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.600
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.233
WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE RUN O

19:39.233 --> 19:42.967
THE MILL GREEK COPTIC.

19:42.967 --> 19:46.100
ONE OF THE OTHER IS FROM JOHN, A

19:46.100 --> 19:48.867
TEXT FROM THE NEW TESTAMEN

19:48.867 --> 19:51.533
THAT'S IN COPTIC IN THIS

19:51.533 --> 19:51.700
FRAGMENT

19:51.700 --> 19:54.367
WHEN THEY SCIENTIFIC DATED TO DO

19:54.367 --> 19:58.700
THE JESUS WIFE PAPYRUS, THEY

19:58.700 --> 20:00.633
DATED THIS TESTMENT OF JOHN.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.833
THEY PUT THE IMAGE OF THAT OTHER

20:02.833 --> 20:05.833
FRAGMENT UP ONLINE ON AN UPDATED

20:05.833 --> 20:07.767
WEBSITE AT HARVARD DIVINIT

20:07.767 --> 20:07.833
SCHOOL

20:07.833 --> 20:09.033
PEOPLE COULD SEE THE OTHER ONE

20:09.033 --> 20:09.300
AS WELL.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.767
NOW HERE'S THE NEWS.

20:10.767 --> 20:13.100
TWO SCHOLARS WORKING IN GERMANY,

20:13.100 --> 20:17.867
ONE AMERICAN, ONE ROMANIAN, THEY

20:17.867 --> 20:19.567
BOTH IN ANALYZING THIS OTHER

20:19.567 --> 20:21.167
FRAGMENT, THE GOSPEL OF JOHN

20:21.167 --> 20:22.900
FRAGMENT HAVE DEFINITIVELY SHOWN

20:22.900 --> 20:24.367
THAT THAT ONE IS A FORGERY

20:24.367 --> 20:26.333
>> SO IF THIS IS IN THE SAME

20:26.333 --> 20:27.400
BATCH, LIKELY BOTH OF THEM ARE

20:27.400 --> 20:27.867
FORGERIES.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.333
>> RIGHT

20:29.333 --> 20:32.000
SO THIS OTHER ONE WAS LENDIN

20:32.000 --> 20:33.733
CREDIBILITY THAT THIS WAS A KIND

20:33.733 --> 20:34.700
OF NORMAL COLLECTION OF SOMEON

20:34.700 --> 20:36.900
WHO JUST HAPPENED TO FIND

20:36.900 --> 20:37.733
BLOCKBUSTER LITTLE SCRAP WIT

20:37.733 --> 20:39.200
THE JESUS WIFE, BUT IF THI

20:39.200 --> 20:41.467
OTHER ONE IS A FORGERY, IT TAKES

20:41.467 --> 20:42.667
EVERYTHING THAT WAS INITIALL

20:42.667 --> 20:44.300
DUBIOUS ABOUT THE JESUS WIFE

20:44.300 --> 20:51.333
FRAGMENT AND AMPLIFIES OUR DUP

20:51.333 --> 20:51.600
DUBIOUSNESS.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.033
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIN

20:54.033 --> 20:56.133
SCHOLARLY DEFENDERS OF THE JESUS

20:56.133 --> 20:57.067
WIFE AFTER THIS WEEK

20:57.067 --> 20:58.800
>> HOW DID ALL THESE SCHOLARS,

20:58.800 --> 21:03.833
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HARVAR

21:03.833 --> 21:05.133
DIVINITY SCHOOL -- GET

21:05.133 --> 21:06.467
HOODWINKED OR BAMBOOZLED

21:06.467 --> 21:07.900
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO

21:07.900 --> 21:10.367
PILE ON IN CRITICISM OF TH

21:10.367 --> 21:10.467
PROFESSOR.

21:10.467 --> 21:11.967
OTHER SCHOLARS SAW IT AS WELL.

21:11.967 --> 21:12.967
IT WASN'T JUST HER

21:12.967 --> 21:13.833
THE TRUTH IS -

21:13.833 --> 21:15.700
>> WE ALL BELIEVED IT, TOO

21:15.700 --> 21:16.833
DON'T GET ME WRONG

21:16.833 --> 21:17.900
>> RIGHT

21:17.900 --> 21:23.900
I THINK IN DOCUMENTARY PAPARUS

21:23.900 --> 21:25.567
MEANING THINGS THAT ARE NO

21:25.567 --> 21:26.700
HOMER OR PLATO, THIS I THINK

21:26.700 --> 21:29.733
THAT ARE HANDED DOWN THAT AR

21:29.733 --> 21:31.067
NOT LITERARY NECESSARILY, THER

21:31.067 --> 21:34.200
ARE A LOT MORE MISTAKES, BAD

21:34.200 --> 21:36.600
GRAMMAR, CONFUSION ABOUT

21:36.600 --> 21:37.000
AUTHENTICITY

21:37.000 --> 21:38.300
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SOMETIMES

21:38.300 --> 21:39.400
DETERMINE WHAT IS REAL OR WHAT

21:39.400 --> 21:40.133
IS NOT

21:40.133 --> 21:42.500
>> SO IS HARVARD STANDING BY

21:42.500 --> 21:43.200
THIS

21:43.200 --> 21:45.733
>> HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL AS OF

21:45.733 --> 21:48.133
LAST I CHECKED HAD NOT MADE

21:48.133 --> 21:49.133
STATEMENT, YES

21:49.133 --> 21:53.633
SO THIS IS PRETTY NEWSY NEWS

21:53.633 --> 21:55.267
THIS IS A COUPLE DAYS SINCE THIS

21:55.267 --> 21:56.500
HAS BROKEN

21:56.500 --> 21:57.667
SO I WAS LOOKING AROUND.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.800
I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND A

21:59.800 --> 22:01.533
STATEMENT BY HARVARD OR ANY OF

22:01.533 --> 22:05.000
THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS THAT HAD

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
SEEN IT WITH THEIR OWN EYES.

22:07.000 --> 22:07.067
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

22:07.067 --> 22:09.733
>> THANK YOU

22:09.733 --> 22:12.633
>>> THIS IS PBC "NEWSHOU
