OUT OF THE CITY FOR THE SUMMER

06:36.000 --> 06:37.533
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU

06:37.533 --> 06:38.767
SHOULD MENTION THAT BECAUSE

06:38.767 --> 06:40.333
WAS SURFING MOSCOW TIMES WEBSITE

CYNICALLY, WHO COULD USE IT TO

06:56.867 --> 06:57.667
THEIR ADVANTAGE?

06:57.667 --> 06:58.900
>> I THINK THE HUMANITARIA

06:58.900 --> 07:04.133
CRISIS IS GOING TO PUT THE MOS

07:04.133 --> 07:06.067
PRESSURE ON THE UKRAINIA

07:06.067 --> 07:06.333
GOVERNMENT

07:06.333 --> 07:08.633
TO AVOID BEING TAINTED BY

TAKING PLACE EAST OF THE

07:12.200 --> 07:12.567
COUNTRY.

07:12.567 --> 07:14.000
SO THAT WOULD PUT MORE PRESSUR

07:14.000 --> 07:16.100
ON THEM TO STOP WHAT THEY CALL

07:16.100 --> 07:17.200
THE ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATION

07:17.200 --> 07:20.967
HERE IN THE EAST

07:20.967 --> 07:22.567
IT ALSO PUTS PRESSURE, TOO

07:22.567 --> 07:24.633
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE LEADERS

07:24.633 --> 07:26.467
HERE SAY THEY WANT MOSCOW TO

07:26.467 --> 07:28.633
BRING IN HUMANITARIAN AID OR

07:28.633 --> 07:29.867
BRING IN PEACEKEEPING TROOPS

07:29.867 --> 07:35.167
SO FAR MOSCOW HAS BEEN ANY SOR

07:35.167 --> 07:37.033
OF RESPONSE TO THOSE REQUESTS.

07:42.667 --> 07:43.633
WHAT'S THE CARROT AND WHAT'S THE

07:43.633 --> 07:43.933
STICK?

07:43.933 --> 07:45.767
>> THE CARROT WAS THAT RUSSI

07:45.767 --> 07:47.167
WOULD BE ON BOARD WITH SOME SORT

07:47.167 --> 07:48.400
OF PEACE PLAN AND THEY COULD

07:48.400 --> 07:51.967
CALL AND WOULD CALL FOR RUSSIA

07:51.967 --> 07:53.000
SEPARATIST, PRO-RUSSIA

07:53.000 --> 07:53.833
SEPARATISTS IN THE COUNTRY T

07:53.833 --> 07:55.200
PUT DOWN THEIR ARMS.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.133
THAT'S THE CARROT HERE

07:57.133 --> 07:59.867
THE STICK IS ALWAYS TH

07:59.867 --> 08:03.000
POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARIZATIO

08:03.000 --> 08:04.333
OF THE BORDER.

ABOUT $6,000 TO DO THAT.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.900
LOVERS DISCOVERED THE BLUE

22:39.900 --> 22:41.500

MYSTERY SURROUNDED THE WORK.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.067

EXPERTS.

23:07.167 --> 23:08.933
WHEN CREATING THE BLUE ROOM HE

23:08.933 --> 23:10.600
PAINTED OVER ANOTHER WORK,

23:10.600 --> 23:12.633
PORTRAIT OF A BEARDED MA

23:12.633 --> 23:13.800
WEARING A BOWTIE

23:13.800 --> 23:15.933
>> PICASSO KNOWN TO PAINT OVER

23:15.933 --> 23:17.433
HIS OWN PICTURES

23:17.433 --> 23:20.233
THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE

23:20.233 --> 23:23.200
THERE'S DOCUMENTATION, DRAWINGS,

23:23.200 --> 23:25.100
OR TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION WHER

23:25.100 --> 23:26.467
IT'S CONFIRMED THE PAINTIN

23:26.467 --> 23:27.767
UNDERNEATH THE PAINTING IS B

23:27.767 --> 23:28.267
PICASSO.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.733
>> ONE EXPLANATION FOR WHY

23:30.733 --> 23:32.400
PICASSO WOULD DO SUCH A THIN

23:32.400 --> 23:34.233
HAS LESS TO DO WITH ART AND MORE

23:34.233 --> 23:36.700
TO DO WITH MONEY OR LACK OF IT

23:36.700 --> 23:38.167
AT THE TIME THE 20-YEAR-OL

23:38.167 --> 23:39.567
SPANIARD LIVING IN PARIS WAS

23:39.567 --> 23:41.667
JUST ONE MORE STRUGGLING ARTIST.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.533
TO PRESERVE WHAT LITTLE HE HAD

23:43.533 --> 23:46.000
HE SOMETIMES REUSED CANVASES

23:46.000 --> 23:48.700
>> WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BY

23:48.700 --> 23:50.300
IDENTIFYING THIS PERSON IS

23:50.300 --> 23:52.767
SOMETHING ABOUT THE CIRCLE O

23:52.767 --> 23:56.467
INDIVIDUALS THAT PICASSO WAS

23:56.467 --> 23:57.567
INTERACTING WITH

23:57.567 --> 23:59.067
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT

23:59.067 --> 24:03.467
EARLY IN HIS CAREER WHEN HE WA

24:03.467 --> 24:05.600
JUST REALLY BEGINNING TO MAK

24:05.600 --> 24:06.533
HIS NAME KNOWN

24:06.533 --> 24:08.667

24:51.667 --> 24:54.733
HE SAYS, QUOTING NOW, WE'R

24:54.733 --> 24:54.833
SUCKERS.

24:54.833 --> 24:55.967
TOTAL SUCKERS.
