03:05.218 --> 03:06.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR IT AT ALL.

03:06.053 --> 03:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW THAT THE TRUCE WAS

03:06.953 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY NOT GOING VERY WELL.

03:09.389 --> 03:10.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOTS OF THINGS THAT WERE

HAPPEN, SUCH AS DELIVERY OF AID

03:13.693 --> 03:15.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO NEEDY CIVILIANS.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE FRONT LINES.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW WE HAVE THIS ALLEGATION

03:20.600 --> 03:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE BOMBED

03:23.703 --> 03:26.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND KILLED 60 SYRIAN SOLDIERS,

03:26.473 --> 03:27.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY'RE KIND OF ADMITTING

03:27.541 --> 03:29.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY PROBABLY DID DO IT.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS GOING TO SEND

03:30.077 --> 03:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENSIONS SKY HIGH AND MAKE

03:32.112 --> 03:33.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAVE ANY INCENTIVE TO ACCEPT THE

03:43.790 --> 03:45.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR DOES HE GO FORWARD AND SAY

03:45.025 --> 03:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN ACT OF WAR?

03:48.128 --> 03:50.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:07.881 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PROVES THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE

04:10.350 --> 04:12.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:14.721 --> 04:16.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:19.860 --> 04:21.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIANS KNEW THEY WERE

04:21.328 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BOMB THIS POSITION.

04:22.562 --> 04:23.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:23.964 --> 04:25.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THROUGH.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS ONE OF FIRST PHASES OF

THIS WEEK?

04:38.578 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ALL.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AID HASN'T GONE INTO ANY OF

THE COMMUNITIES AT ALL BECAUSE

04:42.849 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS

04:43.950 --> 04:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUSED TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR

04:55.862 --> 04:57.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE SEEING THAT

04:57.397 --> 04:58.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE, THAT

04:58.899 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE TWO CLEARLY HADN'T

05:00.066 --> 05:01.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:04.704 --> 05:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE MILITARY

05:05.405 --> 05:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COORDINATION WAS SUPPOSED TO

05:06.406 --> 05:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLLOW SEVEN DAYS OF CALM DURING

05:08.542 --> 05:11.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH AID FLOWED UNIMPEDED TO

05:11.645 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEEDIEST CIVILIANS.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVE

05:15.048 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALM, ALTHOUGH FIGHTING HAS

05:16.116 --> 05:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUED ON THE FRONT LINES,

05:17.317 --> 05:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE AID HAS NOT FLOWED.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE AMERICANS ARE SAYING THE

05:21.221 --> 05:22.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUCE HASN'T WORKED YET.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:25.392 --> 05:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISENTANGLED THE FIGHTERS THEY

05:26.860 --> 05:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTED TO DISENTANGLE, AND NOW

05:28.862 --> 05:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ALMOST CERTAINLY SAY-- HAS

05:40.807 --> 05:44.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
