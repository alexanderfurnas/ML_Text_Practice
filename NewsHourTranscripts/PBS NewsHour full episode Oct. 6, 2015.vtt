WEBVTT

00:06.974 --> 00:10.244
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is on
assignment.

00:10.244 --> 00:14.381
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
death toll rises in South
Carolina, as new flooding
dangers

00:14.381 --> 00:16.483
emerge.

00:16.483 --> 00:23.790
Then: The top U.S. commander in
Afghanistan calls the airstrike
on a hospital a mistake.

00:23.790 --> 00:29.029
Plus: Ann Romney on her new
memoir about living with M.S.
and a forecast about the
presidential

00:29.029 --> 00:30.731
campaign.

00:30.731 --> 00:34.268
ANN ROMNEY, Author, "In This
Together: My Story": This
sentiment is not only out there.

00:34.268 --> 00:39.840
I think it's real, and I think
that politicians are better --
obviously, they're turning to

00:39.840 --> 00:47.447
people outside of the norm to
say, you go in there with a
wrecking ball and just -- just

00:47.447 --> 00:49.783
smash it all to pieces.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.085
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:52.085 --> 00:58.191
(BREAK)

00:58.191 --> 01:11.405
JUDY WOODRUFF: The sun came out
today in South Carolina after
days of a deluge triggered

01:11.405 --> 01:18.278
historic flooding. But the death
toll rose again to 15. More than
75 miles of Interstate

01:18.278 --> 01:23.050
95 remained closed, and
officials warned there's more
flooding to come.

01:23.050 --> 01:25.986
William Brangham
has our coverage.

01:25.986 --> 01:29.990
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The rain has
finally stopped, but waterways
around Columbia, the state
capital,

01:29.990 --> 01:32.726
were still swelling today.

01:32.726 --> 01:38.565
MAN: This residential section,
it is populated with a lot of
different ponds and large lakes,

01:38.565 --> 01:43.337
and, so, unfortunately, all of
them have overfilled the banks.
They have wrecked the dams. They

01:43.337 --> 01:47.908
have ruined all the bridges. And
as you see now, this one lake
behind us has already gone

01:47.908 --> 01:52.179
from being topping over the top
of this bridge to where now it's
emptying out.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.015
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To the
southeast, in the nearly cut-off
town of Manning, the water

01:55.015 --> 01:58.151
was chest-high in Ashley
Perillo's (ph) house.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.487
ASHLEY PERILLO, Flood Victim:
This is all we own. What we got
on us now is all we own.

02:00.487 --> 02:03.690
Our kids only got one outfit
on their body right now.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.760
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Manning is one
of the many places getting
inundated for a second time,

02:06.760 --> 02:11.498
as runoff from higher
elevations heads for the coast.

02:11.498 --> 02:15.102
Governor Nikki Haley warned
today, that means, even as parts
of the state start drying out,

02:15.102 --> 02:17.537
others still face danger.

02:17.537 --> 02:20.407
GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), South
Carolina: The Midlands, now all
that water is going to start

02:20.407 --> 02:23.643
moving down to the low country.
And so we are going to be
extremely careful. We are

02:23.643 --> 02:26.580
watching this minute by minute.

02:26.580 --> 02:31.118
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Haley said the
towns of Orangeburg, Conway,
Georgetown, and Jamestown

02:31.118 --> 02:35.956
are prime candidates to face the
flood threat in coming days.
Meanwhile, for hundreds of

02:35.956 --> 02:39.326
people, home is a
school gymnasium.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.363
WOMAN: I just grabbed my
grandkids and left everything
and just came onto the school
and

02:43.363 --> 02:44.531
just started praying. That's all
I did. I just started praying.
And I said, lord, just

02:44.531 --> 02:49.336
take care of us. And he did.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.907
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Red Cross
has 26 shelters operating
statewide, including this one at

02:53.907 --> 02:57.811
A.C. Flora High School in
Columbia with cots for about 200
people.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.847
ANTHONY TORNETTA, American Red
Cross: This is a safe place for
them to come, get out

03:00.847 --> 03:04.317
of the weather. Temperatures are
starting to drop. It's
nightfall. This is an
opportunity

03:04.317 --> 03:09.923
for them to get warm, get some
food, regroup, recover, and
think about what next steps are.

03:09.923 --> 03:14.061
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back in
Columbia, the next steps for
more than 1,100 National
Guardsmen

03:14.061 --> 03:19.366
and others involve working to
shore up dams and repair
breached levees. Today, crews
used

03:19.366 --> 03:23.336
heavy machinery to deliver
massive sandbags in a bid to
keep the water at bay.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.573
I'm William Brangham for
the "PBS NewsHour."

03:26.573 --> 03:31.311
JUDY WOODRUFF: Utilities are
also trying to restore safe
drinking water for some 400,000

03:31.311 --> 03:34.748
customers around Columbia.

03:34.748 --> 03:39.686
In the day's other news, the
head of NATO stepped up his war
of words with Russia for

03:39.686 --> 03:45.125
violating Turkey's airspace.
Russia maintains that its planes
twice strayed into Turkey

03:45.125 --> 03:49.296
accidentally, as they were
on bombing runs in Syria.

03:49.296 --> 03:53.400
But, in Brussels, NATO's chief
rejected that explanation, and
charged that Russia's actions

03:53.400 --> 03:55.469
are -- quote -- "unacceptable."

03:55.469 --> 04:00.640
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General: This is a
serious violation of the
airspace.

04:00.640 --> 04:08.815
And, actually, there were two
violations during the weekend.
So, that just adds to the fact

04:08.815 --> 04:13.987
that this doesn't look
like an accident.

04:13.987 --> 04:19.759
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Russians said their latest
targets were towns in northern

04:19.759 --> 04:25.699
Aleppo province that are under
Islamic State control, as well
as militant bases in Palmyra.

04:25.699 --> 04:31.571
Turkey is warning that three
million more refugees could flee
the fighting in Syria.

04:31.571 --> 04:36.743
The new estimate came today at a
meeting of European officials in
Brussels. E.U. nations,

04:36.743 --> 04:41.214
in turn, offered Turkey more
than $1 billion in aid, plus
other incentives, in a bid to

04:41.214 --> 04:44.551
stem the flow.

04:44.551 --> 04:49.990
The European Union's highest
court has handed privacy
advocates a major victory.
Today's

04:49.990 --> 04:56.062
decision struck down an
agreement that lets Facebook and
others transfer consumer
information

04:56.062 --> 05:01.668
to the U.S. unimpeded. The court
said revelations about U.S.
surveillance shows the
information

05:01.668 --> 05:06.640
is not being adequately
protected, and European
officials echoed the point.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.477
HEIKO MAAS, German Minister of
Justice and Consumer Protection
(through translator):

05:10.477 --> 05:14.981
The verdict of the European
Court of Justice is a strong
signal for more data protection

05:14.981 --> 05:19.986
and greater protection of
privacy in a globally
interconnected world. That will
only be possible

05:19.986 --> 05:23.290
if the data of European users
which is saved in the U.S. is
better protected in future

05:23.290 --> 05:25.425
than before.

05:25.425 --> 05:29.095
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ruling could
make it far more difficult for
thousands of companies

05:29.095 --> 05:33.033
to do business, in the face
of consumer complaints.

05:33.033 --> 05:40.440
A Chicago company could face a
record fine, nearly $2 million,
for flying drones in Chicago

05:40.440 --> 05:44.744
and New York without permission.
The Federal Aviation
Administration proposed the
penalty

05:44.744 --> 05:51.251
today for SkyPan International.
The FAA says the aerial
photography company made dozens

05:51.251 --> 05:56.923
of drone flights into restricted
airspace over nearly three
years.

05:56.923 --> 06:02.829
Scientists from Canada and Japan
have won this year's Nobel Prize
for Physics for explaining

06:02.829 --> 06:09.502
how neutrinos fit into the
universe. Working separately,
Arthur McDonald and Takaaki
Kajita

06:09.502 --> 06:15.108
proved the subatomic particles
have mass. In Tokyo today,
Kajita said the research is

06:15.108 --> 06:20.046
just one small step toward
understanding the complexities
of the cosmos.

06:20.046 --> 06:26.419
TAKAAKI KAJITA, Nobel Prize
Winner (through translator): The
universe we live in is filled

06:26.419 --> 06:30.790
with things that have yet to be
discovered. Such enormous
questions are not resolved in

06:30.790 --> 06:35.495
research that is done in a
matter of one day or two days,
but it takes many people getting

06:35.495 --> 06:39.633
involved over the course of many
years to unravel the mystery.
So, I really hope young

06:39.633 --> 06:42.802
people will participate in
solving these mysteries.

06:42.802 --> 06:48.375
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most neutrinos
that reach Earth were created by
nuclear reactions inside the

06:48.375 --> 06:53.847
sun, and trillions of them pass
through the human body every
second.

06:53.847 --> 06:58.652
There's word the Obama
administration deported fewer
immigrants over the past year
than at

06:58.652 --> 07:05.425
any time since 2006. The
Associated Press reports that
231,000 people were sent home

07:05.425 --> 07:09.629
in the 12 months that ended in
September. That doesn't include
Mexicans who were caught

07:09.629 --> 07:13.633
at the border and
quickly returned.

07:13.633 --> 07:18.905
This was a lackluster day on
Wall Street. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 13

07:18.905 --> 07:27.013
points to close at 16790. The
Nasdaq fell nearly 33 points,
and the S&P 500 lost seven.

07:27.013 --> 07:33.486
And, horror of horrors, pumpkin
pie could be in short supply
come Thanksgiving. Crop

07:33.486 --> 07:39.959
experts in Illinois say record
rain in June washed out crops in
the state that grows 90

07:39.959 --> 07:44.264
percent of U.S. pumpkins. They
say there should be enough
jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween,

07:44.264 --> 07:49.502
but canned pumpkin is liable to
run low before Thanksgiving.

07:49.502 --> 07:54.240
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the top U.S. commander in
Afghanistan comes under fire

07:54.240 --> 07:59.512
for a mistaken airstrike; the
6,000 inmates that the
Department of Justice is aiming
to

07:59.512 --> 08:05.185
release from prison early; Ann
Romney on her new memoir and
today's politics; a conversation

08:05.185 --> 08:20.700
with the Dalai Lama,
and much more.

08:20.700 --> 08:25.538
The top U.S. military commander
in Afghanistan went before the
Senate Armed Services Committee

08:25.538 --> 08:30.844
today and recommended altering
the plan to withdraw American
troops in that country.

08:30.844 --> 08:35.915
He also shed more light on the
deadly incident earlier this
week in which a civilian
hospital

08:35.915 --> 08:38.752
was mistakenly attacked
by U.S. aircraft.

08:38.752 --> 08:42.021
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL, Commander of
U.S. Forces in Afghanistan: To
be clear, the decision

08:42.021 --> 08:46.993
to was a U.S. decision made
within the U.S. chain of
command. A hospital was
mistakenly

08:46.993 --> 08:48.828
struck.

08:48.828 --> 08:54.768
JUDY WOODRUFF: That mistake
killed at least 22 people Friday
in Kunduz. Today, General

08:54.768 --> 08:59.672
John Campbell, facing committee
chair Senator John McCain
acknowledged it was an American

08:59.672 --> 09:02.208
decision to strike.

09:02.208 --> 09:07.280
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: The Afghan
forces on the ground requested
air support from our forces

09:07.280 --> 09:10.784
that are on the ground. Even
though the Afghans request that
support, it still has to go
through

09:10.784 --> 09:15.121
a rigorous U.S. procedure to
enable fires to go on the
ground.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.123
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona:
But there was no forward air
controllers, American forward

09:17.123 --> 09:19.692
air controllers on the ground?

09:19.692 --> 09:23.696
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: Sir, we had
a special operations unit that
was in close vicinity

09:23.696 --> 09:27.133
that was talking to the aircraft
that delivered those fires.

09:27.133 --> 09:33.206
JUDY WOODRUFF: Initial accounts
had said the AC-130 gunship
fired in support of the American

09:33.206 --> 09:37.877
troops. The evolving story has
led Doctors Without Borders to
demand a fully independent

09:37.877 --> 09:39.979
investigation.

09:39.979 --> 09:43.049
New Hampshire Democrat
Jeanne Shaheen:

09:43.049 --> 09:46.886
SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D), New
Hampshire: Do you have any
reason to object to having an

09:46.886 --> 09:52.592
independent investigation done
by the U.N. or another
independent body of what
happened?

09:52.592 --> 09:56.596
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: Ma'am, I
have trust and confidence in the
folks that will do the
investigation

09:56.596 --> 10:01.734
for NATO, the folks that will do
the investigation for DOD and
the Afghan partners. And so, you

10:01.734 --> 10:05.638
know, all the very, very tough
questions that we're all asking,
they will get after that.

10:05.638 --> 10:09.108
SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: But, as I
understand your answer, then,
you wouldn't object to

10:09.108 --> 10:11.744
and would cooperate with
an independent body?

10:11.744 --> 10:14.581
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: I would let
my higher headquarters or senior
personnel make that

10:14.581 --> 10:16.916
decision.

10:16.916 --> 10:22.722
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the White
House announced the Justice
Department is also
investigating.

10:22.722 --> 10:28.628
The airstrikes at Kunduz came
amid a pitched battle to retake
the city, the first one captured

10:28.628 --> 10:36.135
by the Taliban since 2001.
Campbell said, given the Taliban
surge and the Islamic State's

10:36.135 --> 10:41.007
entry into Afghanistan, he's
proposing extending the U.S.
presence beyond what the
president

10:41.007 --> 10:44.010
outlined 16 months ago.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.914
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: By the end of
2016, our military will draw

10:47.914 --> 10:52.886
down to a normal embassy
presence in Kabul, with a
security assistance component,
just

10:52.886 --> 10:55.221
as we have done in Iraq.

10:55.221 --> 11:00.493
JUDY WOODRUFF: That deadline was
mentioned repeatedly today,
ruefully by some.

11:00.493 --> 11:05.265
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: I'm not making
this up, as he said, just as we
have done in Iraq.

11:05.265 --> 11:09.802
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reports last
night said the Obama White House
is now considering a force

11:09.802 --> 11:15.341
of 5,000 troops, as Maine
independent Angus King noted.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.379
SEN. ANGUS KING (I), Maine: In
your professional military
judgment, conditions on the
ground

11:19.379 --> 11:23.449
at the present time would
require some revision of the
withdrawal plan to a
Kabul-centric

11:23.449 --> 11:27.787
1,000 personnel by the end
of 2016. Is that correct?

11:27.787 --> 11:33.459
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: The options
I provided provide pros and cons
of different levels

11:33.459 --> 11:36.596
of support above and
beyond the 1,000.

11:36.596 --> 11:40.700
SEN. ANGUS KING: But I'm not
asking you what you recommended.
I'm asking you for your
professional

11:40.700 --> 11:43.770
judgment as you're sitting here
today that there should be some
revision to that plan.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.805
GEN. JOHN CAMPBELL: Yes, sir.

11:45.805 --> 11:51.411
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is no
timetable on when that decision
will be made.

11:51.411 --> 11:56.182
And we take a closer look at the
future role of the U.S. in
Afghanistan with retired Army

11:56.182 --> 12:01.854
Lieutenant General David Barno.
He served as a commander of U.S.
and coalition forces

12:01.854 --> 12:07.327
in Afghanistan. He now teaches
at American University. And
Scott Smith, he is director

12:07.327 --> 12:12.532
of the Afghanistan and Central
Asia Program at the United
States Institute of Peace. For

12:12.532 --> 12:16.402
over a decade, he worked for the
United Nations, where he focused
on Afghanistan.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.272
And we welcome you
both to the program.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.874
General Barno, I'm going
to begin with you.

12:21.874 --> 12:26.913
What more can you add to what
the U.S. military officials are
now saying was a mistake in

12:26.913 --> 12:30.116
this strike on the
hospital in Kunduz?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.752
LT. GEN. DAVID BARNO (RET.),
U.S. Army: Well, I think we have
seen the story evolve over

12:32.752 --> 12:37.256
the last several days, which
is totally unsurprising to me.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.827
This incident happened in the
middle of the night at about
2:00 in the morning on early

12:40.827 --> 12:47.133
Saturday morning. It involved a
U.S. aircraft, an AC-130 Spectre
gunship, which typically

12:47.133 --> 12:51.437
fly several thousand feet in the
air, striking a target that
later turned out to be the
Medecins

12:51.437 --> 12:54.507
Sans Frontieres
hospital in Kunduz.

12:54.507 --> 12:59.078
And we have also found out now
that there was a special forces
team, an American special

12:59.078 --> 13:02.982
forces team, on the ground
nearby that was talking to the
aircraft. And I think all of

13:02.982 --> 13:05.718
this is indicative of fog of war
and a big fight for Kunduz
that's been raging for the

13:05.718 --> 13:08.254
last week.

13:08.254 --> 13:13.760
And I'm very, very unsurprised
to find out that the situation
is continuing to evolve.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.964
And I am encouraged to see there
will be at least three
investigations that we know of

13:17.964 --> 13:21.668
right now to take a look at
this. This is not unusual in
Afghanistan. I tragically saw

13:21.668 --> 13:25.104
some of these incidents occur
when I was the commander there.

13:25.104 --> 13:31.110
And it always is tragic. It's
always disastrous to our efforts
in many ways there. And the

13:31.110 --> 13:34.847
investigations find new ways to
prevent these from happening,
but, inevitably, in these

13:34.847 --> 13:37.050
type of wars, especially when
we're in close civilian areas,
we are going to see these

13:37.050 --> 13:39.552
kind of accidents occur.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.588
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scott Smith,
there's a lot of outrage over
this. Is that appropriate,

13:42.588 --> 13:45.892
I mean, given what the
general is explaining here?

13:45.892 --> 13:49.829
SCOTT SMITH, United States
Institute of Peace: Appropriate
or not, it's not an unexpected

13:49.829 --> 13:51.798
emotion to come out of it.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.068
I think what the MSF people
are saying is that...

13:55.068 --> 13:57.837
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
Doctors Without Borders.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.440
SCOTT SMITH: Doctors -- sorry,
the French acronym for Doctors
Without Borders.

14:00.440 --> 14:06.879
That there was repeated fire
every 15 minutes over an hour
after they were calling to say,

14:06.879 --> 14:10.149
look it, you're hitting a
hospital right now. Who knows
what the truth is? We will have

14:10.149 --> 14:12.985
to see what the investigation
comes -- investigations comes
out with, what witnesses on the
ground

14:12.985 --> 14:15.655
say.

14:15.655 --> 14:22.495
But it's unfortunate. As General
Barno said, it's not uncommon,
but it is definitely
unfortunate.

14:22.495 --> 14:28.901
JUDY WOODRUFF: General Barno, we
noticed that Afghan President
Ghani doesn't seem to be

14:28.901 --> 14:33.673
as critical as typically
President Karzai has been in the
past of the United States.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.742
How do you explain that?

14:35.742 --> 14:38.611
LT. GEN. DAVID BARNO: Well, this
is a big change. And I think
it's a welcome one for

14:38.611 --> 14:42.415
the United States and
for our NATO allies.

14:42.415 --> 14:47.320
President Karzai over his
12-plus years in office became
more and more frustrated with

14:47.320 --> 14:51.157
the coalition military presence
and was very, very forceful in
his response to these kinds

14:51.157 --> 14:53.626
of incidents.

14:53.626 --> 14:57.263
And I think President Ghani, who
realizes that President Obama
here in the United States

14:57.263 --> 15:01.601
is about to make a critical
decision about keeping American
forces in Afghanistan or

15:01.601 --> 15:04.270
drawing them down to only
several hundred, President Ghani
is a little bit more cautious.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.539
He's been more reserved.

15:06.539 --> 15:11.677
And I think he and many of his
senior officials have already
come out to say this is tragic,

15:11.677 --> 15:15.515
but we understand how this can
happen and we look forward to
the results of the
investigation.

15:15.515 --> 15:19.051
His response has been very
muted, and I think that's been
appropriate, given the
investigation.

15:19.051 --> 15:22.455
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scott Smith,
let's broaden this out and talk
about the -- what the Taliban

15:22.455 --> 15:25.658
actually did in there in Kunduz.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.495
How significant that they were
able to make their first
takeover of a major city in,
what,

15:29.495 --> 15:30.797
14, 15 years?

15:30.797 --> 15:34.667
SCOTT SMITH: I think
it's very significant.

15:34.667 --> 15:39.872
First of all, it is first city
which has fallen, and Kunduz was
also the last city that fell

15:39.872 --> 15:43.709
to -- the last Taliban-occupied
city that fell to American
troops in 2001, so there's

15:43.709 --> 15:47.346
sort of a symbolic
dimension to this.

15:47.346 --> 15:52.251
Secondly, the fact that, from
what my sources on the ground
are saying, the government has

15:52.251 --> 15:55.888
not taken it back -- they have
taken part of it back, but
there's still fighting, and

15:55.888 --> 15:58.524
it's not just booby traps. But
there is actually still some
resistance in the
street-to-street

15:58.524 --> 16:00.860
fighting.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.297
Third, the Taliban has opened up
fighting in other parts of the
north. There have been

16:04.297 --> 16:08.234
three other provincial capitals
that have also been under
attack. So, this is not only

16:08.234 --> 16:11.804
about Kunduz. It's about the
wider northern area where,
remember, so far up to now, they

16:11.804 --> 16:14.874
haven't had a very
significant toehold.

16:14.874 --> 16:19.111
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, General
Barno, what is your sense of
where things stand then in
Afghanistan

16:19.111 --> 16:21.214
right now?

16:21.214 --> 16:25.117
LT. GEN. DAVID BARNO: Well, I
would reinforce those points.
This is of very deep concern,

16:25.117 --> 16:30.356
the fact that the Taliban are
this active and this aggressive
now in Northern Afghanistan,

16:30.356 --> 16:33.759
which for almost a decade has
been the most quiet part of
Afghanistan in terms of
insurgent

16:33.759 --> 16:35.361
activity.

16:35.361 --> 16:39.332
We have always worried about the
southern part of Afghanistan,
around Kandahar. We have

16:39.332 --> 16:44.136
worried about the east around
Jalalabad. Those have been
hotbeds of Taliban activity
really

16:44.136 --> 16:48.474
since the middle of the last
decade. This is a new, very
unwelcome phenomenon. They're

16:48.474 --> 16:52.712
deeply entrenched in the north
now. And that should give us
great cause for concern.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.048
And it certainly is going to
influence President Obama's
decision, in my judgment.

16:56.048 --> 16:59.952
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about that, General Barno. I
mean, if the situation

16:59.952 --> 17:05.324
is that unstable and that
concerning, is keeping another
5,000 troops going to make a
difference,

17:05.324 --> 17:07.526
if that's what the
president decides to do?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.562
LT. GEN. DAVID BARNO: I think
it will make a big difference.

17:09.562 --> 17:13.699
And I think the fact that, if
you were to go down to several
hundred, the Afghan security

17:13.699 --> 17:17.970
forces, the Afghan army would
lose all of its connection to
things like American firepower,

17:17.970 --> 17:21.707
American logistics, American
trainers and advice. And that's
crucial to keep them in

17:21.707 --> 17:24.176
the battle right now
against the Taliban.

17:24.176 --> 17:28.547
If we take that out, I think
their ability to continue to go
toe to toe with the Taliban

17:28.547 --> 17:32.485
will diminish very, very
rapidly. And they have been in
this fight. They're not running

17:32.485 --> 17:36.355
away from the Taliban. They're
in the fight in all of these
cities. So, that's encouraging.

17:36.355 --> 17:39.325
But if we take American troops
down to just a few that are
around the embassy in Kabul,

17:39.325 --> 17:41.894
I think that is going
to be put at deep risk.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.598
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Scott Smith,
it sounds like the U.S. needs to
remain there -- at

17:45.598 --> 17:49.268
least the general is saying that
-- to stiffen the spine and
provide other support for the

17:49.268 --> 17:49.902
Afghan forces.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.572
SCOTT SMITH: And I agree.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.443
Part of it is all of the
elements that General Barno
mentioned, the financial
support, the

17:57.443 --> 18:01.847
continuing training support,
airpower, which we have seen has
been something which they

18:01.847 --> 18:05.251
had last year and has
been taken away.

18:05.251 --> 18:08.387
There's also a big psychological
dimension to this. Afghans feel
they're about to be

18:08.387 --> 18:14.160
abandoned again by the West, as
they were in 1992. And I think,
if this decision is

18:14.160 --> 18:17.596
going to be taken, and I think
it probably will be taken, to
stay -- keep more troops

18:17.596 --> 18:21.600
in there longer than originally
anticipated, I wish it had been
taken earlier, because

18:21.600 --> 18:25.137
then it would have been seen as
part of a contribution to our
strategic partnership

18:25.137 --> 18:27.373
with the Afghans.

18:27.373 --> 18:31.243
Now it looks like it's in
reaction to the loss of Kunduz,
and therefore kind of more

18:31.243 --> 18:35.181
of a panicked reaction, even
though this discussion has been
under way for at least a year.

18:35.181 --> 18:38.017
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, so many
questions raised about this.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.419
For now, though, we want
to thank both of you.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.955
General David Barno, retired
general, thank you.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.824
And, Scott Smith, we thank you.

18:44.824 --> 18:48.527
SCOTT SMITH: Thank you.

18:48.527 --> 18:55.167
LT. GEN. DAVID BARNO:
Thanks very much.

18:55.167 --> 19:00.740
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the largest
ever one-time release of federal
prisoners, the Justice

19:00.740 --> 19:06.545
Department announced today a
plan to set free some 6,000
inmates.

19:06.545 --> 19:10.649
Jeffrey Brown looks at that.
It's part of our ongoing series
Broken Justice on efforts

19:10.649 --> 19:14.320
to address mass
incarceration in the U.S.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.524
JEFFREY BROWN: The move is aimed
at nonviolent drug offenders,
and it's part of a broader

19:18.524 --> 19:22.261
push on a number of fronts to
provide relief to individuals
hit with harsh sentences and

19:22.261 --> 19:25.364
to reduce overcrowded prisons.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.968
The first group of inmates from
around the nation will be
released between October 30

19:28.968 --> 19:33.139
and November 1. More will
follow in the coming year.

19:33.139 --> 19:36.942
Joining us now is Maurice
Chammah of The Marshall Project,
a nonprofit news site focused on

19:36.942 --> 19:38.444
criminal justice issues.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.546
Welcome to you.

19:40.546 --> 19:45.017
So, first, tell us a little bit
about who these 6,000 prisoners
are. Why are they in

19:45.017 --> 19:46.919
particular being released?

19:46.919 --> 19:49.188
MAURICE CHAMMAH, The
Marshall Project: Sure.

19:49.188 --> 19:53.592
So, these are all, according to
the Department of Justice,
low-level and nonviolent drug

19:53.592 --> 19:59.432
offenders who went into the
system a number of years ago.
And then a year ago, the U.S.

19:59.432 --> 20:03.803
Sentencing Commission, which is
an independent judicial
organization, set new sentencing

20:03.803 --> 20:08.607
guidelines and made those
retroactive, which meant that
prisoners who were serving time

20:08.607 --> 20:13.646
for drug crimes in the federal
system could apply for new
sentences to have their
sentences

20:13.646 --> 20:17.416
reduced under the
new guidelines.

20:17.416 --> 20:24.657
And it took about a year for the
DOJ to prepare and the Bureau of
Prisons to prepare to release

20:24.657 --> 20:29.795
these prisoners, but they're all
coming at one time as sort of
the first wave of this,

20:29.795 --> 20:35.201
and then over next year, a
little over 8,000 prisoners
stand to also be released. In
total,

20:35.201 --> 20:37.870
it's been estimated that over
40,000 will be released
eventually.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.172
JEFFREY BROWN: Forty
thousand in total.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.943
But individuals, the process is
that they apply to it and they
get a yea or nay. And

20:43.943 --> 20:47.646
what happens to
them upon release?

20:47.646 --> 20:53.619
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Well, after
they apply to a judge, and the
judge, you know, working

20:53.619 --> 20:56.422
with probation officers and
prosecutors, decides that
they're not going to be a
threat, they're

20:56.422 --> 20:59.492
sent to halfway houses. Some of
them are on home confinement.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.294
And then, eventually, they will
be released back into the
community.

21:02.294 --> 21:07.399
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, this is very
much part of a larger movement
to deal with mass incarceration,

21:07.399 --> 21:12.138
right? And this is also very
much connected with changing
mandatory sentence guidelines.

21:12.138 --> 21:17.610
MAURICE CHAMMAH: That's correct,
although this sort of sits
alongside those efforts.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.747
It is kind of a major symbolic
moment, at the same time that
both the Senate and the

21:21.747 --> 21:27.186
House are considering major
criminal justice reform bills,
which would change mandatory

21:27.186 --> 21:32.758
minimum sentences, work to give
more resources for people coming
out of federal prisons,

21:32.758 --> 21:35.694
and a variety of other kind
of reform initiatives.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.864
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Congress
looking at it, a number of
initiatives, and, interestingly

21:38.864 --> 21:43.636
enough, bipartisan, right, to
bringing together a lot of folks
that often aren't together

21:43.636 --> 21:44.670
on various issues.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.906
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Right.

21:46.906 --> 21:50.676
What's so interesting about this
is that it's coming at a moment
where increasingly over

21:50.676 --> 21:56.649
the past several years
conservatives, kind of coming up
from a groundswell of kind of

21:56.649 --> 22:01.787
mini-movements in Texas and
Utah, are saying that the
criminal justice system as it
stands

22:01.787 --> 22:05.591
now represents a waste of money,
a waste of human potential.

22:05.591 --> 22:11.297
And so you do see a lot of
Republicans whose predecessors
perhaps in the '80s and '90s,

22:11.297 --> 22:16.769
like their fellow Democrats,
supported extremely, sort of
tough-on-crime, long sentences,
harsh

22:16.769 --> 22:19.838
mandatory minimums. You're
seeing a really interesting kind
of bipartisan moment right

22:19.838 --> 22:20.906
now.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.342
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so you
have that on the one hand.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.913
But are there also concerns? How
much concern do you hear about
the potential for a spike

22:27.913 --> 22:31.684
in crime, say, upon the release
of all these prisoners?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.653
MAURICE CHAMMAH: I think it's
going to be really interesting
in the coming days to see

22:34.653 --> 22:39.925
what that concern looks like,
whether different voices in the
media bring it up.

22:39.925 --> 22:44.396
Certainly, a year ago, when the
Sentencing Commission made this
decision to allow these

22:44.396 --> 22:51.270
prisoners to be released,
Senator Chuck Grassley, who
heads up the Senate Judiciary
Committee,

22:51.270 --> 22:56.642
expressed concern that murderers
and robbers would be let back
out onto the streets. He

22:56.642 --> 23:03.182
hasn't spoken yet about this
group of 6,000, but it stands to
reason that there is a camp,

23:03.182 --> 23:05.117
particularly with some in the
Republican Party, though perhaps
not exclusively, who are going

23:05.117 --> 23:07.586
to raise a concern.

23:07.586 --> 23:13.559
And there is not yet really
proof whether these people are
going to represent a danger,

23:13.559 --> 23:17.229
though it should be kind of
mentioned in this context that,
every year, that the federal

23:17.229 --> 23:24.637
government and the states
release hundreds of thousands of
prisoners, and it's not
necessarily

23:24.637 --> 23:26.505
the case that this group of
6,000 are sort of more or less
dangerous than the larger

23:26.505 --> 23:28.140
group.

23:28.140 --> 23:31.510
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're saying
this will be a potential test
case for recidivism rates

23:31.510 --> 23:34.580
for released prisoners, clearly.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.582
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Absolutely, a
test case for that, and also
just a test case for the sort

23:36.582 --> 23:39.051
of political
appetite for reform.

23:39.051 --> 23:43.789
JEFFREY BROWN: And this is still
a relatively small number of
prisoners, right? We're talking

23:43.789 --> 23:47.026
about a very large
problem in the country.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.994
MAURICE CHAMMAH:
Correct. Correct.

23:48.994 --> 23:54.366
If you see, you know,
overincarceration as a problem,
which many increasingly do, this

23:54.366 --> 24:00.005
group of 6,000 prisoners is kind
of a drop in the bucket. Even
the 40,000 prisoners who

24:00.005 --> 24:05.477
stand to eventually get out from
this sort of small political
movement, you know, are

24:05.477 --> 24:07.880
sort of, again, a very small
portion of the 2.2 million
people who are in prisons and

24:07.880 --> 24:09.815
jails around the U.S.

24:09.815 --> 24:13.719
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Maurice Chammah of The Marshall
Project, thanks so much.

24:13.719 --> 24:21.694
MAURICE CHAMMAH: Thank you.

24:21.694 --> 24:27.700
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:27.700 --> 24:32.671
Coming up on the "NewsHour": Ann
Romney on her battle with M.S.
and the race for the

24:32.671 --> 24:38.177
White House; a conversation with
the Dalai Lama on his mission to
find peace; and what

24:38.177 --> 24:43.882
makes "Over the Rainbow"
a classic tune.

24:43.882 --> 24:49.888
But, first, Donald Trump said
today he is not getting out of
the Republican race for

24:49.888 --> 24:55.094
president, despite having said
this weekend he would bow out if
his numbers dropped.

24:55.094 --> 25:01.233
While some expected him to fade,
Trump continues to roll -- poll,
that is, in the high double

25:01.233 --> 25:07.673
digits, followed by Ben Carson
and Carly Fiorina, two others
who have never held elected
office.

25:07.673 --> 25:11.009
Political director Lisa
Desjardins looks at what is
driving all this.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.345
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: Right now, and you
know it...

25:13.345 --> 25:17.182
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump is
both famous and famously direct.

25:17.182 --> 25:22.287
DONALD TRUMP: We have illegal
immigrants that are treated
better by far than our veterans.

25:22.287 --> 25:27.192
LISA DESJARDINS: But he has been
propelled by what may be the
least known, least understood

25:27.192 --> 25:34.833
group of voters in the 2016
race. Their overall feelings are
clear: anger, fear and distrust.

25:34.833 --> 25:40.539
Steve Carby is a small business
man. You see him here defending
Donald Trump to protesters.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.042
He's worried about veterans, and
he likes Trump's directness.

25:44.042 --> 25:48.013
STEVE CARBY, Trump Supporter:
One of the main reasons that I
find him attractive as far

25:48.013 --> 25:50.883
as someone who would represent
me is because he says what he
wants to say, and the other

25:50.883 --> 25:53.752
thing is, is that I don't
think he can be bought.

25:53.752 --> 25:58.257
LISA DESJARDINS: Stay-at-home
mom of two Amanda Mancini, she
is worried about her kids'
future.

25:58.257 --> 26:03.896
AMANDA MANCINI, Trump Supporter:
I'm very concerned about his
education. He's in public

26:03.896 --> 26:08.534
school, but only because, you
know, we can only afford for one
child to go to private

26:08.534 --> 26:15.274
school. But I see the stuff that
he brings home with the Common
Core. It makes no sense.

26:15.274 --> 26:19.478
LISA DESJARDINS: These are
conservative issues, but, most
importantly, these voters are
against

26:19.478 --> 26:23.715
the establishment, including
the Republican establishment.

26:23.715 --> 26:27.553
Salon and spa owner Elaine
Yoachum is angry at the GOP
leadership.

26:27.553 --> 26:32.090
ELAINE YOACHUM, Trump Supporter:
I have voted for Republicans for
the last 20 years, and

26:32.090 --> 26:37.663
I'm feeling like I have kind of
wasted my time and my vote. When
I heard Trump speak,

26:37.663 --> 26:43.936
I thought, this is somebody that
can be a leader and change the
Republican Party.

26:43.936 --> 26:49.842
LISA DESJARDINS: This is key to
Trump's strength. In a national
FOX News poll out last week,

26:49.842 --> 26:56.114
26 percent of likely Republican
voters backed him, eight points
ahead of anyone else.

26:56.114 --> 26:59.718
But look at what else Republican
voters felt in that poll. Sixty
percent of them said their

26:59.718 --> 27:02.254
party has betrayed them.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.523
DONALD TRUMP: They will never
make America great again.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.493
LISA DESJARDINS: Enter
Trump's outsider appeal.

27:07.493 --> 27:13.332
DONALD TRUMP: They're controlled
fully by the lobbyists, by the
donors.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.535
LISA DESJARDINS: It's an
appeal not everyone buys.

27:16.535 --> 27:20.906
DAVID MCINTOSH, President, Club
for Growth: He's not really the
outsider we think he is.

27:20.906 --> 27:25.377
He's more like the typical
politician, where he is telling
us what we want to hear, but

27:25.377 --> 27:29.081
reality is he would be very
different if he were ever in
office.

27:29.081 --> 27:34.052
LISA DESJARDINS: David McIntosh
heads the conservative advocacy
group Club for Growth,

27:34.052 --> 27:39.358
which focuses on fiscal
policies, low taxes, small
government. The Club has
attacked current

27:39.358 --> 27:43.395
Republican leaders like House
Speaker John Boehner, and they
see Trump as worse. They're

27:43.395 --> 27:47.699
running this $1 million
ad campaign against him.

27:47.699 --> 27:51.270
NARRATOR: Trump wants us to
think he's Mr. Tell It Like It
Is, but he has a record, and

27:51.270 --> 27:53.839
it's very liberal.

27:53.839 --> 28:00.245
DAVID MCINTOSH: He's been for
frequent tax increases. He's not
for free trade. He supported

28:00.245 --> 28:03.782
the single-payer health care
system, government-run health
care. Those are not
conservative, free

28:03.782 --> 28:05.684
market policies.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.153
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump
denies that he's liberal.

28:08.153 --> 28:15.027
DONALD TRUMP: I will be totally
pledging my allegiance to the
Republican Party and the

28:15.027 --> 28:18.163
conservative principles
for which it stand.

28:18.163 --> 28:21.700
LISA DESJARDINS: Despite his
critics, for the past month,
Trump has mostly held an eight-

28:21.700 --> 28:26.138
to 10-point lead nationally. Can
anything put a dent in that?

28:26.138 --> 28:31.977
Well, polls do show some
potential red flags on
personality and ability. In a
USA Today

28:31.977 --> 28:37.215
survey, the top five words
American voters used to describe
Donald Trump were all negative,

28:37.215 --> 28:41.620
including idiot, arrogant and
selfish. The top word for
Republican voters was arrogant.

28:41.620 --> 28:46.358
But countering that, Trump may
also be riding an historic wave.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.360
BEVERLY GAGE, Professor, Yale
University: One of the really
remarkable things that you're

28:48.360 --> 28:53.699
seeing in the United States
right now are genuinely high
levels of immigration, at a

28:53.699 --> 28:58.136
level we really haven't seen
since the turn of the 20th
century.

28:58.136 --> 29:02.674
LISA DESJARDINS: Beverly Gage,
Yale University history
professor, says times like
these,

29:02.674 --> 29:07.412
with nearly 15 percent of the
population being foreign-born,
spark movements.

29:07.412 --> 29:12.784
BEVERLY GAGE: You also usually
see accompanying these kind of
heightened periods of
immigration

29:12.784 --> 29:17.856
is a kind of backlash politics
that argues that immigrants
shouldn't be here in the United

29:17.856 --> 29:21.493
States, that they're taking
Americans' jobs. And depending
on, you know, who you're talking

29:21.493 --> 29:25.564
about and at what moment,
that takes different shapes.

29:25.564 --> 29:29.568
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump voters,
including Mexican immigrant
Zander Saenz, say this is why
they

29:29.568 --> 29:32.170
are sticking with Trump.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.040
ZANDER SAENZ, Trump Supporter: I
believe that Mexico has taken
advantage of the United States

29:35.040 --> 29:39.111
through immigration. The elites
in Mexico, I agree with Donald
Trump, that they don't

29:39.111 --> 29:40.512
want the poor in Mexico. They
want to bring them over to
America.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.815
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
make our country so great.

29:43.815 --> 29:49.254
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a push for
new direction, new leadership, a
push also helping Carly

29:49.254 --> 29:54.292
Fiorina, who is quickly rising
in the polls, and Ben Carson,
who is getting within reach

29:54.292 --> 29:59.164
of Trump nationally, the three
GOP front-runners, who are also
the only three candidates who

29:59.164 --> 30:01.500
have never held office before.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.771
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa
Desjardins joins me now.

30:05.771 --> 30:11.209
So, Lisa, it is a phenomenon out
there with Donald Trump. But
where is the race right

30:11.209 --> 30:15.047
now with Trump, with Carson,
with Fiorina, all three
outsiders, as you point out?

30:15.047 --> 30:16.948
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

30:16.948 --> 30:20.385
And you can pick any one poll
you like, but if you look at the
trend, Judy, over the last

30:20.385 --> 30:24.823
month, what has happened is,
Trump has basically plateaued.
He's stayed steady. He's dipped

30:24.823 --> 30:29.027
a little bit in Iowa, but,
overall, he has stayed about the
same.

30:29.027 --> 30:34.199
Carson and Fiorina are on the
rise as a whole, and Fiorina
especially, Judy. We have really

30:34.199 --> 30:38.403
seen her go from the back of the
pack, not just to up close to
the front, but third and

30:38.403 --> 30:41.373
in some polls even
second in the race.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.276
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can you tell if
this is because of something
Donald Trump is doing or is it

30:44.276 --> 30:47.279
something because of
Carson and Fiorina?

30:47.279 --> 30:52.818
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, we know
that Trump's unfavorability
rating is relatively high to

30:52.818 --> 30:55.754
theirs, that Carson and Fiorina
have higher favorability.
They're more well-liked than

30:55.754 --> 30:57.589
Trump.

30:57.589 --> 31:02.861
Now, those who support Trump
love him, but there is a large
group that doesn't. And a

31:02.861 --> 31:08.600
problem for Trump going down the
road, Judy, is that 47 percent
of GOP voters say they

31:08.600 --> 31:13.371
are willing to consider him.
That means more than half who
say they're not even willing

31:13.371 --> 31:16.475
to consider Donald Trump. That's
a problem for the future. It's
not a problem that Carson

31:16.475 --> 31:18.844
or Fiorina have.

31:18.844 --> 31:22.814
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do we have any
way of quantifying how many
voters are paying attention at
this

31:22.814 --> 31:25.150
point, Republican or Democrat?

31:25.150 --> 31:29.554
LISA DESJARDINS: To be honest,
no, because these polls ask
people, are you a likely
Republican

31:29.554 --> 31:33.759
voter, are you a likely
caucus-goer? We're not asking
them -- or no one is asking
them,

31:33.759 --> 31:36.261
how much are you paying
attention? How much do you know
about these candidates?

31:36.261 --> 31:39.397
So, to some degree, this might
be name recognition, and it
might be buzz.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.099
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is --
as we said, it's a phenomenon.

31:41.099 --> 31:41.800
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.168
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we
keep on watching it.

31:43.168 --> 31:46.404
Lisa Desjardins, we thank you.

31:46.404 --> 31:56.581
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

31:56.581 --> 32:04.589
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now another
addition to our "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

32:04.589 --> 32:10.562
Some have called it a storybook
life, married to her teenage
sweetheart, mother of five

32:10.562 --> 32:15.200
children, financially secure
with a loving, supportive
husband.

32:15.200 --> 32:21.573
But, in 1997, Ann Romney was
diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis, an autoimmune disease

32:21.573 --> 32:27.512
which cannot be cured, but can
be treated. Now she has written
a memoir, "In This Together:

32:27.512 --> 32:30.749
My Story," her account of the
journey she has traveled these
last 18 years.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.751
Welcome, Ann Romney.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.553
ANN ROMNEY, Author, "In This
Together: My Story": Thank you
so much.

32:34.553 --> 32:39.157
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is a very
personal story. It's, in fact,
remarkably personal for someone

32:39.157 --> 32:40.158
who has been so much
in the public eye.

32:40.158 --> 32:41.293
ANN ROMNEY: Right.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.095
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
hard was it to write?

32:44.095 --> 32:49.501
ANN ROMNEY: Well, it was hard,
because it was -- I had to go
back to those very dark

32:49.501 --> 32:53.672
days, which was, not -- it's not
like I felt proud of myself, how
depressed I was and how

32:53.672 --> 32:57.542
sorry I felt for myself.

32:57.542 --> 33:02.013
But I knew it was important, and
I wanted to share this story, so
I wanted to -- I deliberately

33:02.013 --> 33:06.718
made it personal, so that people
would know that I was opening my
heart to them and that

33:06.718 --> 33:12.257
I was sharing with them where I
was and where I have come since
then.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.426
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you go in
knowing you wanted to be really
candid? Because you are candid

33:14.426 --> 33:16.528
in here.

33:16.528 --> 33:22.133
ANN ROMNEY: You know, they're --
I did. I wanted to be candid. It
was very deliberate.

33:22.133 --> 33:25.370
And then, when I had written a
lot of it, the publisher came
back and they said, we

33:25.370 --> 33:31.443
want more. And so I brought out
a few more stories that I
wouldn't really have shared.

33:31.443 --> 33:36.081
It was hard in some ways, but
then also so honest, and I
wanted to be that way, so that

33:36.081 --> 33:41.887
people can honestly know that I
am here to try to help people.

33:41.887 --> 33:46.491
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it really
is your journey from the
diagnosis, what, 18 years ago
through

33:46.491 --> 33:50.395
various therapies. You seem
to be doing very well.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.465
But what's been the
hardest part of this?

33:53.465 --> 33:57.903
ANN ROMNEY: I think the hardest
part was initially, when I was
first diagnosed. And then I was

33:57.903 --> 34:03.842
so sick that it stripped
me from my identity.

34:03.842 --> 34:09.014
And how it did that was that I
think we identify ourselves by
labels or things that we are

34:09.014 --> 34:12.851
able to do: I am this. I am a
good cook. I am a good mother. I
am a good this. I am a

34:12.851 --> 34:15.787
good doctor. I am a good lawyer.

34:15.787 --> 34:20.225
When you can't do those things
anymore, you wonder where your
identity is. And I think,

34:20.225 --> 34:25.263
for me, it was going to places
where I was uncomfortable going
and being stripped down,

34:25.263 --> 34:27.666
so that I was really vulnerable.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.603
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you are
open about the treatments you
have tried, everything from

34:31.603 --> 34:36.675
chemotherapy, horseback riding
therapy, something called
reflexology, your faith.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.277
What is your view of
alternative medicine?

34:39.277 --> 34:43.348
ANN ROMNEY: Well, I like to tell
people, when they get a
diagnosis like, this, of course,

34:43.348 --> 34:46.418
go to the Western treatment,
and especially with M.S.

34:46.418 --> 34:51.289
It's very important that people
get aggressive and early
treatment. This is different
than

34:51.289 --> 34:54.659
what it was when I was first
diagnosed, where they said wait
until you're much sicker to

34:54.659 --> 35:00.131
get treatment. But now we know,
get aggressive treatment from
the very beginning.

35:00.131 --> 35:05.470
But after that, you know, the
sad thing is, you still don't
feel well. You still have

35:05.470 --> 35:10.141
symptoms of fatigue and all
these things, that it's just
unrelenting and very
debilitating.

35:10.141 --> 35:16.648
And I found that reflexology
worked for me. I found that
riding horses worked for me.

35:16.648 --> 35:21.319
Finding joy in your life is
another really important
component. And losing yourself
in

35:21.319 --> 35:24.422
doing something else, and not
always dwelling on your illness
is very important.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.958
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's a lot in
here that's really
inspirational.

35:26.958 --> 35:33.531
And I have to ask you a little
bit about politics. You said
after the campaign of 2012 that
you

35:33.531 --> 35:36.001
felt terrible for what
America had lost.

35:36.001 --> 35:36.935
ANN ROMNEY: Right.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.737
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was
right after the election.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.538
How do you feel about how
things are going today?

35:40.538 --> 35:43.541
ANN ROMNEY: Well,
it's frustrating.

35:43.541 --> 35:48.146
You know, we can see that it
looks like there is an economic
recovery. And, at the same

35:48.146 --> 35:55.653
time, that recovery has left out
the middle class and millions of
Americans. And so we

35:55.653 --> 36:01.359
still have so many problems. We
look at internationally. What is
happening in the Middle East is
just

36:01.359 --> 36:06.064
-- is heart-wrenching and
devastating. And you think of
the hundreds of thousands of

36:06.064 --> 36:10.902
Syrian refugees and all the
problems that are happening in
the world.

36:10.902 --> 36:17.776
And it is frustrating for me to
watch this, because I feel as
though Mitt would have been

36:17.776 --> 36:23.848
a very good president. And I
said, it's not our loss, because
our lives are fine, but

36:23.848 --> 36:27.285
the country lost by not
having Mitt as president.

36:27.285 --> 36:30.455
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you did give
some thought, both of you, to
running this time, decided...

36:30.455 --> 36:31.222
ANN ROMNEY: For
about 20 seconds.

36:31.222 --> 36:31.956
(LAUGHTER)

36:31.956 --> 36:34.759
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
you decided not to.

36:34.759 --> 36:39.230
But we now have a contest on the
Republican side where it seems
people with no government

36:39.230 --> 36:43.835
experience are more favored than
anybody else. Do you think
that's healthy?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.937
ANN ROMNEY: Well, I think it's a
reflection of a sentiment, and
I'm not sure it's where

36:45.937 --> 36:48.440
we will end up.

36:48.440 --> 36:52.477
There's a lot of ups and downs
in a campaign, but I think it's
a reflection. And if you

36:52.477 --> 36:57.248
look at both the Democratic
contest and the Republican
contest, the same thing is
happening,

36:57.248 --> 37:03.221
where people are -- I think feel
-- I think the voters feel
disenfranchised.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.892
I think they feel like things go
on in Washington without the
best interest of the American

37:07.892 --> 37:15.133
-- that -- the public being put
first. I think they're right. I
think government has been

37:15.133 --> 37:19.737
run for a long time by special
interests, and listening to the
lobbyists. And I think

37:19.737 --> 37:22.740
people are really
frustrated with that.

37:22.740 --> 37:29.447
So, I think the sentiment is not
only out there. I think it's
real, and I think that

37:29.447 --> 37:35.487
politicians are better --
obviously, they're turning to
people outside of the norm to
say,

37:35.487 --> 37:40.258
you go in there with a wrecking
ball and just -- just smash it
all to pieces.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.359
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.828
ANN ROMNEY: And I think
that's their sentiment.

37:43.828 --> 37:49.834
I think, at the end of the day,
they will come to and coalesce
around a candidate that

37:49.834 --> 37:53.838
will be able to unify and also
respond to some of this
sentiment.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.974
JUDY WOODRUFF: But maybe not
where they are right now?

37:55.974 --> 38:00.712
ANN ROMNEY: I don't think they
will be where they are right
now. I think they will come

38:00.712 --> 38:04.382
and try to find someone maybe
with a little -- a little
experience.

38:04.382 --> 38:07.652
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just have to
ask you one other question.

38:07.652 --> 38:11.289
And that is a story in The Wall
Street Journal today, front
page, about the cost of
prescription

38:11.289 --> 38:15.927
drugs. And they single out drugs
for multiple sclerosis, and they
talk about, in the last,

38:15.927 --> 38:20.665
I think, decade, drugs went up
an average of 16 percent a year
each year over the last

38:20.665 --> 38:21.166
decade.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.467
ANN ROMNEY: Yes.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.067
It's -- it's...

38:23.067 --> 38:24.702
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
does that say?

38:24.702 --> 38:29.207
ANN ROMNEY: Well, it's -- we all
know that the drug companies are
responsible for a lot

38:29.207 --> 38:31.609
of the research.

38:31.609 --> 38:36.614
And we know that it is extremely
expensive for them to do that,
and it costs a lot of

38:36.614 --> 38:43.521
money for them to do it. But we
also know that, once they get an
exclusive use of a

38:43.521 --> 38:47.859
certain drug, that they do seem
to take a bit of advantage of
that.

38:47.859 --> 38:52.330
So, there has to be a
recognition that we need that.
We need the drug companies
spending

38:52.330 --> 38:58.836
that money and doing that
research. We also need them to
be responsible for not hurting

38:58.836 --> 39:01.606
people that are desperate
for some of these drugs.

39:01.606 --> 39:04.008
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been a
pleasure talking with you, Ann
Romney.

39:04.008 --> 39:07.245
The book is "In This
Together: My Story."

39:07.245 --> 39:11.649
Thank you very much.

39:11.649 --> 39:19.490
ANN ROMNEY: Thank you very much.

39:19.490 --> 39:26.197
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Pope Francis
visited the East Coast a few
weeks back, another world

39:26.197 --> 39:30.735
religious figure, the Dalai
Lama, was in Minnesota, where
doctors at the Mayo Clinic
advised him

39:30.735 --> 39:35.006
to cut short his own
tour of the U.S.

39:35.006 --> 39:38.977
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro recently sat down
with the spiritual leader of
Tibetan

39:38.977 --> 39:42.981
Buddhism at his exile
home in India.

39:42.981 --> 39:48.019
A version of this story aired on
the PBS program "Religion &
Ethics Newsweekly."

39:48.019 --> 39:55.360
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Until
doctors recently told him to
slow down, the 80-year-old Dalai

39:55.360 --> 40:00.732
Lama had kept a breathless pace.
In just a few weeks last summer,
he was at a music festival

40:00.732 --> 40:10.475
in England, a presidential
library in Houston, and a
sold-out stadium near Los
Angeles.

40:10.475 --> 40:15.280
There is perhaps no world figure
today with a more diverse face
of fans.

40:15.280 --> 40:20.852
Why are you so popular globally?
Why are you a rock star?

40:20.852 --> 40:23.621
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA,
Leader of Tibetan Buddhism: I
don't know. I never pay
attention

40:23.621 --> 40:26.958
about that, why people
praise me, why, why.

40:26.958 --> 40:31.663
CROWD (singing): Happy birthday
to you. Happy birthday.

40:31.663 --> 40:38.436
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And he said
he's not concerned about another
matter that is many minds, who

40:38.436 --> 40:43.841
will succeed him, or, as he's
increasingly said in recent
years, whether anyone will.

40:43.841 --> 40:51.349
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA:
Many people showing interest
about the institution of Dalai
Lama.

40:51.349 --> 40:52.917
For me, not much interest.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.819
(LAUGHTER)

40:54.819 --> 41:00.258
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That's
significant. Like the familiar
laugh, his role as Dalai Lama

41:00.258 --> 41:05.863
-- the world's best known
Buddhist leader -- has been
central to who he is, the
reincarnation

41:05.863 --> 41:10.601
of Dalai Lamas going back six
centuries, leader of a fabled
once-upon-a-time country high

41:10.601 --> 41:13.871
in the Himalayas.

41:13.871 --> 41:20.144
He fled with U.S. help to India
in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Tibet's annexation

41:20.144 --> 41:26.050
by Mao Zedong's revolutionary
People's Republic of China.

41:26.050 --> 41:32.890
Today, at his home base in
Dharamsala, India, he still
keeps a full schedule. It begins

41:32.890 --> 41:41.232
early each morning as a diverse
crowd lines up for a chance to
meet him.

41:41.232 --> 41:45.970
Many are from the tens of
thousands of Tibetans who
followed him and settled in
India, where

41:45.970 --> 41:50.942
the Dalai Lama set up a secular
Tibetan government in exile and
later took on a mostly
ceremonial

41:50.942 --> 41:52.777
role.

41:52.777 --> 42:01.786
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA: You
see, in 2011, I totally retired,
now no connection with

42:01.786 --> 42:03.788
political responsibility.

42:03.788 --> 42:09.060
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says he's
now focused on his moral
responsibility as an advocate

42:09.060 --> 42:15.933
for world peace, one that's won
him numerous awards, including
the Nobel Peace Prize.

42:15.933 --> 42:20.071
A prolific lecturer, he says
that peace must start with the
individual, with compassion

42:20.071 --> 42:26.077
for one's fellow human beings.
It's a message that he says
isn't uniquely Buddhist.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.680
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA: All
major religions teach the
practice of compassion, love,
forgiveness,

42:29.680 --> 42:31.849
tolerance.

42:31.849 --> 42:39.056
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He wants to
see ethics common to all
religions taught in schools,

42:39.056 --> 42:44.395
because he says religious
leaders have too often focused
on excludes and division,
leading

42:44.395 --> 42:49.567
to both conflict and growing
inequality, between and within
societies.

42:49.567 --> 42:55.907
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA:
Like America, a very rich
country, but many people poor,

42:55.907 --> 43:05.683
and then India and China now
developing great potential, like
Africa also, a lot of potential.

43:05.683 --> 43:16.928
But I think this lack of moral
principle, in that respect, I
think, you see, we need

43:16.928 --> 43:19.363
some sort of lesson,
education about socialism.

43:19.363 --> 43:21.732
(LAUGHTER)

43:21.732 --> 43:28.172
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA: I
am socialist. And then,
furthermore, as far as social
economy

43:28.172 --> 43:31.809
theory concerned, I am Marxist.
I am Buddhist Marxist.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.911
(LAUGHTER)

43:33.911 --> 43:40.084
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says
materialism and consumerism have
prevailed, even in places

43:40.084 --> 43:46.791
where political leaders pledge
themselves to Marxist or
socialist ideals.

43:46.791 --> 43:52.864
The most prominent example is
China, he said, now trying to
regain its moral compass. Its

43:52.864 --> 43:56.534
leader, Xi Jinping, recently
acknowledged a role for its
religious traditions, including

43:56.534 --> 43:58.769
Buddhism.

43:58.769 --> 44:08.679
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA:
It's unthinkable, a communist,
atheist, you see, leader of that

44:08.679 --> 44:15.953
express publicly importance of
Buddhism, is something quite
unique. So this, I think the

44:15.953 --> 44:22.793
reality now shows just the
material development alone will
not get satisfaction to the
public,

44:22.793 --> 44:25.363
to the people.

44:25.363 --> 44:29.233
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: While the
Chinese government and Communist
Party have called for more
tolerance

44:29.233 --> 44:32.937
and religious freedom, they have
condemned the Dalai Lama as a
separatist and a puppet

44:32.937 --> 44:37.275
of the West.

44:37.275 --> 44:42.313
With China's prominence in
global trade as the world's
second largest economy, many
Western

44:42.313 --> 44:48.119
nations have become more muted
in their support of the Dalai
Lama. For his part, the exiled

44:48.119 --> 44:51.556
leader, while alleging human
rights abuses and the
destruction of Tibetan culture
in

44:51.556 --> 44:55.226
his homeland, has
moderated his demands.

44:55.226 --> 45:00.298
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA: We
are seeking genuine autonomy,
not seeking independence.

45:00.298 --> 45:05.136
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But he's
drawn a line in the sand on one
issue, China's insistence

45:05.136 --> 45:11.609
that the government approve
the next Dalai Lama.

45:11.609 --> 45:16.681
The anointing can take years
after the Dalai Lama's death, in
which monks look for
supernatural

45:16.681 --> 45:22.954
signs to lead them to the young
boy who is the reincarnation.
The current Dalai Lama,

45:22.954 --> 45:28.826
born of simple peasant stock as
Tenzin Gyatso, was identified at
age 3 and installed at 15

45:28.826 --> 45:31.829
after years of rigorous study.

45:31.829 --> 45:39.470
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA: As
far as 1969 I publicly stated
this institution, whether

45:39.470 --> 45:43.941
should continue or not,
entirely up to Tibetan people.

45:43.941 --> 45:48.846
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In the
modern age, when democratic
governance and Buddhist
scholarship

45:48.846 --> 45:54.018
are much more accessible, he
says he's not sure there's a
need for a new Dalai Lama.

45:54.018 --> 45:58.923
When he turns 90, he says, he
will consult on the question
with religious elders and

45:58.923 --> 46:02.693
the Tibetan people, before
deciding whether to be
reincarnated, like his
predecessors,

46:02.693 --> 46:05.563
or to end the tradition.

46:05.563 --> 46:11.936
For now, it's a decision that
this very public figure says is
very private.

46:11.936 --> 46:19.410
HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA:
These inner values and world
peace and a happy world, this is

46:19.410 --> 46:25.950
our common responsibility. About
next life is individual
business. Our concept of God,

46:25.950 --> 46:29.854
concept of nirvana, concept of
next life is private business.

46:29.854 --> 46:32.023
(LAUGHTER)

46:32.023 --> 46:41.932
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this is Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Dharamsala,

46:41.932 --> 46:46.303
India.

46:46.303 --> 46:56.113
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
"Over the Rainbow," the classic
ballad written by Harold

46:56.113 --> 47:02.019
Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, and made
famous by Judy Garland in "The
Wizard of Oz."

47:02.019 --> 47:07.158
Tomorrow marks the anniversary
of its first recording back in
1938.

47:07.158 --> 47:12.329
And Jeffrey Brown joined
composer and musician Rob
Kapilow recently at the
Signature Theatre

47:12.329 --> 47:16.200
in Arlington, Virginia, to
look at why the song endures.

47:16.200 --> 47:20.237
JEFFREY BROWN: "Over the
Rainbow," right, one of the most
-- everybody knows this song,

47:20.237 --> 47:24.008
but why? What makes
us know this song?

47:24.008 --> 47:27.578
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: You know,
amazingly, the answer to that
starts with the very first

47:27.578 --> 47:32.116
two notes. In this famous
opening idea, there's really
only two ideas. One of them, I
call

47:32.116 --> 47:33.951
leap. The other one, I call
circle and yearn. And it's
important.

47:33.951 --> 47:34.719
(CROSSTALK)

47:34.719 --> 47:36.620
JEFFREY BROWN: Leap
and circle and yearn.

47:36.620 --> 47:37.955
ROB KAPILOW: It's important you
learn these technical terms,
Jeffrey.

47:37.955 --> 47:38.389
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, I see.

47:38.389 --> 47:38.889
ROB KAPILOW: Circle and yearn.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.691
So, it starts off with this.

47:40.691 --> 47:41.859
JEFFREY BROWN: I didn't learn
that with piano lessons, by the
way, right?

47:41.859 --> 47:43.961
ROB KAPILOW: It's time.

47:43.961 --> 47:48.132
We start off with this big leap.
This is a full octave leap.
That's a big leap for a

47:48.132 --> 47:51.168
popular song. In fact, producers
were worried that nobody would
buy the song because it

47:51.168 --> 47:53.971
would be too hard to
sing this opening leap.

47:53.971 --> 47:58.542
Now, this leap isn't just a big
leap musically. It's a leap
between two different worlds and

47:58.542 --> 48:02.880
two parts of the voice. The
first note is kind of low down
there in chest voice. It's

48:02.880 --> 48:07.785
Dorothy's troubled reality. It's
Kansas, aridity, no flowers.
It's the black and white of the

48:07.785 --> 48:09.887
beginning of the film.

48:09.887 --> 48:12.623
JUDY GARLAND, Actress: Someplace
where there isn't any trouble.
Do you suppose there is

48:12.623 --> 48:16.327
such a place, Toto?

48:16.327 --> 48:21.031
ROB KAPILOW: So, this is Kansas.
The upper note, it is more
ethereal. It's like -- it's

48:21.031 --> 48:25.336
where she wants to escape to.
It's Oz. It's over the rainbow.

48:25.336 --> 48:30.174
So, these two notes, Kansas and
Oz, are going to turn out to be
the key to the whole song,

48:30.174 --> 48:33.911
but you won't get their final
meaning until the last notes of
the song.

48:33.911 --> 48:43.888
JUDY GARLAND (singing):
Somewhere over the rainbow, way
up high, there's a land that

48:43.888 --> 48:53.964
I heard of once in a lullaby.

48:53.964 --> 48:55.666
JEFFREY BROWN: And you're
saying through two notes?

48:55.666 --> 48:58.569
ROB KAPILOW: Through two notes.
And now watch what happens.

48:58.569 --> 49:03.741
The only other idea is circle
and yearn. So, you start on a
note, you circle back to it,

49:03.741 --> 49:07.077
and then you yearn. That's it,
circle and yearn. Now, there are
three...

49:07.077 --> 49:08.879
(CROSSTALK)

49:08.879 --> 49:11.081
JEFFREY BROWN: And the question
is, what are we -- what is she
warning for? And at the

49:11.081 --> 49:13.284
end, we realize, right?

49:13.284 --> 49:16.453
ROB KAPILOW: Yes, exactly. She's
yearning for high C. She's
yearning for high C.

49:16.453 --> 49:23.160
So, look, there's three leaps.
First one is big on "somewhere."
Next one is smaller on

49:23.160 --> 49:31.235
"way up." Third one is lower and
even smaller, "there's a," OK,
so three leaps. Like her

49:31.235 --> 49:34.839
leaps, her world is contracting.

49:34.839 --> 49:38.642
Now, it's really the harmony
that makes it so exquisite. You
know, Yip Harburg called

49:38.642 --> 49:41.779
this song of yearning. So,
here's what she's yearning
about. He could easily have
written

49:41.779 --> 49:44.048
kind of a cheery accompaniment
to "way up high," like this.

49:44.048 --> 49:48.219
(singing): Way up high.

49:48.219 --> 50:04.735
But listen to the yearning in
the piano part here. I mean, it
doesn't get more beautiful.

50:04.735 --> 50:11.909
That's why we're still listening
into it today, those beautiful
chords. Then, it's so subtle.

50:11.909 --> 50:20.584
He could have written this for
"there's a," but listen to the
one dark chord.

50:20.584 --> 50:28.158
And then we finish with two
circle and yearns, circle,
yearn, circle and yearn.

50:28.158 --> 50:33.664
Now, why is that so fantastic?
Why does it hold together? Well,
really, what we have

50:33.664 --> 50:38.135
done, remember, Kansas, Oz. He
really takes it back from Oz
back to Kansas in a simple

50:38.135 --> 50:38.736
scale.

50:38.736 --> 50:40.337
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:40.337 --> 50:56.287
ROB KAPILOW: But he does it like
this. So, we yearn for Oz. We're
stuck in Kansas.

50:56.287 --> 50:59.056
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. But the
circle, it occurs to me as
you're doing this, is to end up
back

50:59.056 --> 51:00.224
at home.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.393
ROB KAPILOW: To end
up back at home.

51:02.393 --> 51:05.195
JEFFREY BROWN: So, that's -- the
theme of the film that we all
remember is there embedded

51:05.195 --> 51:05.462
in the music.

51:05.462 --> 51:07.765
ROB KAPILOW: It is.

51:07.765 --> 51:11.835
But when she comes back the
home, she understands home in a
completely different way. And
that's

51:11.835 --> 51:15.272
what makes the ending of the
song so magical, because, we do
the second verse, we're still

51:15.272 --> 51:19.143
stuck in Kansas, "dreams really
do come true." We have a
beautiful middle. We don't have

51:19.143 --> 51:21.211
to talk about it.

51:21.211 --> 51:25.950
We come back and do it a third
time, same music. And the song
should have finished at,

51:25.950 --> 51:28.319
"Why, then, oh, then why can't
I?" But there would have been no
transformation.

51:28.319 --> 51:29.887
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:29.887 --> 51:32.790
ROB KAPILOW: She would have been
home, but she would never have
gone to Oz.

51:32.790 --> 51:36.527
In a beautiful moment -- and
this is a fantastic moment --
Arlen decides to bring back the

51:36.527 --> 51:40.464
middle of the song, but in the
orchestra. There's a beautiful
quote from Yip Harburg,

51:40.464 --> 51:44.668
who wrote the words. He said:
"Words make you think thoughts,
music makes you feel a

51:44.668 --> 51:48.706
feeling, but a song makes
you feel a thought."

51:48.706 --> 52:00.084
And you can feel her thinking.
Just the orchestra. Then she
comes back, just like in the B
section,

52:00.084 --> 52:03.287
"if happy little
blue birds fly."

52:03.287 --> 52:10.027
JUDY GARLAND (singing): If happy
little blue birds fly beyond the
rainbow, why, oh, why

52:10.027 --> 52:13.430
can't I?

52:13.430 --> 52:22.773

JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

52:29.513 --> 52:39.523
ROB KAPILOW: One last rise.
"Why, oh, why," and where does
she finally get to? Oz. From

52:39.523 --> 52:45.796
low C to high C, from Kansas to
Oz, from reality to fantasy, and
her transformation is complete.

52:45.796 --> 52:47.331
JEFFREY BROWN: "Over
the Rainbow."

52:47.331 --> 52:49.199
