JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.866 --> 00:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: After
the Supreme Court clears the
way, parts of President Trump's

00:11.533 --> 00:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
controversial travel
ban go into effect.

00:14.566 --> 00:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: Mr. Trump's latest attack
on Twitter aimed at a cable
news anchorwoman brings sharp

00:21.066 --> 00:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
criticism for crossing
the line of civility.

00:24.233 --> 00:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And serving a health care
desert -- how one low-income
community in California is using

00:31.000 --> 00:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its local firehouse to
provide affordable care.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO, Alameda County
Health Care Services Agency:
Fire stations, firefighters

00:37.366 --> 00:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are strategically located
in every community.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we saw this as an existing,
but perhaps untapped resource
to serve our patient population.

00:48.133 --> 00:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:56.166 --> 00:59.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After months
of legal and political
wrangling, President
Trump's executive order

01:08.833 --> 01:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banning entry into the U.S. from
six Muslim-majority countries
goes into effect tonight.

01:15.833 --> 01:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this week, the Supreme
Court gave a partial green
light to get started, ordering

01:20.433 --> 01:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those with what it called bona
fide family or business ties
to the U.S. be granted entry.

01:27.066 --> 01:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last night, the Trump
administration laid out
which connections count.

01:30.933 --> 01:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And joining us to discuss these
guidelines is Yeganeh Torbati.

01:34.666 --> 01:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She covers the State
Department for Reuters.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yeganeh, welcome
back to the program.

01:38.966 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what is the administration
saying now about who is
permitted in and who isn't?

01:43.133 --> 01:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI, Reuters: Right.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From these six countries, and
individuals who have certain
family connections, so spouses,

01:51.233 --> 01:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mothers, fathers, children,
siblings, even step-siblings,
they can be allowed in.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The State Department is counting
that as a bona fide connection.

01:59.066 --> 02:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you are the grandparents
of a U.S. citizen, for
instance, or the grandchild,

02:03.633 --> 02:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you are trying to get in
and you're a citizen from one
of these six countries, that

02:06.933 --> 02:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't count in the State
Department, in the U.S.
administration's view.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there
was also a definition of
business relationship.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Right.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if you are a student
that has been accepted
into a U.S. university,
someone with an offer

02:21.533 --> 02:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of employment from an American
company, or even a lecturer
coming in to lecture at a

02:26.566 --> 02:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conference, for instance,
or university, you
can be allowed in.

02:28.833 --> 02:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if are you someone who has
just booked a hotel room or a
tour or something like that,

02:33.333 --> 02:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that does not count.

02:35.366 --> 02:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
those people who were in the
process of trying to get a

02:38.233 --> 02:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
visa to come here?

02:40.333 --> 02:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: So, any
individual who has been
granted a visa, those
visas are not going

02:42.600 --> 02:44.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be revoked.

02:44.633 --> 02:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are still valid and
they will still be able to
come into the United States.

02:46.733 --> 02:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's thousands
potentially of people
who had applied for
visas, they were waiting

02:51.266 --> 02:52.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to hear back.

02:52.466 --> 02:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those individuals,
we're not exactly sure.

02:54.866 --> 02:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that is going to
be something that now consulate
officers will have to take

02:59.333 --> 03:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into account these guidelines
when they are assessing, are
they actually going to give

03:02.900 --> 03:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that visa to that person or not?

03:05.000 --> 03:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Yeganeh, did
the administration explain how
it made this dividing line when

03:10.666 --> 03:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it comes to family
relationships?

03:12.600 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: It seemed
a little bit arbitrary
from the outside.

03:14.633 --> 03:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the administration said
today to reporters is that they
looked at guidelines that they

03:20.833 --> 03:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have from the Immigration
Nationality Act, which is the
main U.S. law that governs U.S.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said that that is how
they are going to assess which
family relationships count

03:28.500 --> 03:31.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and which don't.

03:31.066 --> 03:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics, of course, say
that they're still hewing
this line very narrowly,
they're interpreting

03:34.300 --> 03:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Supreme Court ban narrowly,
the Supreme Court ruling
narrowly, so that they can let

03:38.733 --> 03:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in as few people as possible.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So we know this
has been subject to litigation.

03:42.833 --> 03:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it expected there are
going to be more lawsuits
or does this settle it?

03:45.733 --> 03:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: We haven't
seen people, and refugee groups
or institutions like the ACLU

03:50.366 --> 03:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running yet saying that they
are going to be suing over
this or filing new complaints.

03:55.066 --> 03:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is certainly a possibility.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One other thing to mention
is that the administration
seems to be very narrowly
interpreting which

04:01.200 --> 04:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
refugees it's going to let in.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is saying that just having a
relationship to a resettlement
agency is not enough, and

04:07.600 --> 04:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
therefore any additional
refugees that will be
coming in this year
will have to have some

04:11.733 --> 04:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
family relationship
in the United States.

04:13.933 --> 04:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The refugee groups are
very upset about that.

04:16.100 --> 04:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think that that violates
the spirit, if not the letter
of the Supreme Court's order.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something that
we're going to see if there
is going to be litigation or

04:24.100 --> 04:25.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It doesn't seem like
as of yet there's been
any complaints filed.

04:27.833 --> 04:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Yeganeh Torbati with
Reuters, thanks very much.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This goes into effect
tonight at 8:00 Eastern.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Yes.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We thank you.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEGANEH TORBATI: Thank you.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news: Republicans in the
U.S. House of Representatives

04:39.333 --> 04:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pushed through two bills
on illegal immigration.

04:42.900 --> 04:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One toughens prison terms
for deportees who reenter
the U.S. illegally.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other blocks some
federal funds to so-called
sanctuary cities that
refuse to assist immigration

04:55.366 --> 04:57.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officials.

04:57.933 --> 05:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The secretary of homeland
security and congressional
Democrats traded
arguments today over that

05:00.533 --> 05:03.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
second bill.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary: The
word sanctuary calls
to mind some place

05:05.166 --> 05:07.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safe.

05:07.666 --> 05:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But too often for families
and victims affected
by illegal immigrant
crime, sanctuary cities

05:11.900 --> 05:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are anything but safe.

05:13.900 --> 05:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, these cities are places
that allow some criminal go
free, undermine federal law

05:19.633 --> 05:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enforcement and make our
communities less safe.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADRIANO ESPAILLAT (D), New
York: A sanctuary city is a city
that allows a mom to take her

05:26.033 --> 05:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kid to school without being
fearful that the principal will
call Homeland Security on her.

05:33.466 --> 05:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It allows a domestic
violence victim the ability
to go to the local precinct
and report a batterer.

05:39.133 --> 05:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a safety net for people
that are part of our family.

05:43.900 --> 05:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bills
now move to the Senate,
but it's not clear that
either can pass there.

05:50.800 --> 05:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Republican leaders
struggled again today to revise
their health care bill, and

05:56.133 --> 05:58.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
win enough Republican
votes to pass it.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell said there's been
-- quote -- "good progress."

06:01.333 --> 06:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Senator Susan Collins
of Maine warned that the
bill needs a major overhaul.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also today, further analysis by
the Congressional Budget Office
found the bill would cut federal

06:13.100 --> 06:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid spending by 35
percent over 20 years.

06:16.866 --> 06:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A top Vatican official, Cardinal
George Pell, was charged today
with sexual assault in his

06:22.933 --> 06:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
native Australia.

06:25.433 --> 06:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the top financial
adviser to Pope Francis,
and the highest-ranking
Vatican official implicated

06:30.700 --> 06:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the long-running scandal
of clergymen abusing children.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News has our report.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHANE PATTON, Commissioner,
Victoria State Police: Cardinal
Pell is facing multiple charges,

06:41.700 --> 06:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in respect to historic
sexual offenses.

06:44.633 --> 06:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And there are multiple
complaints relating
to those charges.

06:47.766 --> 06:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: Last year, the
former archbishop of Melbourne
and Sydney, who is now one of

06:52.500 --> 06:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the pope's top advisers,
testified to a royal commission
investigating child sex abuse.

06:59.366 --> 07:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission found
shocking levels of abuse
by the clergy over decades.

07:06.133 --> 07:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pell supported, by bishops as
a man of integrity, conceded
institutional errors, but denied

07:11.000 --> 07:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any sexual offenses himself.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
News from Australia reached the
Vatican overnight, and before
dawn on the fifth day of Saints

07:21.433 --> 07:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peters and Paul, Cardinal Pell
released his first statement,
saying he would return home

07:25.966 --> 07:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next month to clear his name.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then early this morning,
he spoke to the press.

07:30.966 --> 07:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARDINAL GEORGE PELL, Vatican
Treasurer: I am looking forward
finally to having my day

07:35.500 --> 07:37.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in court.

07:37.200 --> 07:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am innocent of these charges.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They are false.

07:44.300 --> 07:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The whole idea of sexual
abuse is abhorrent to me.

07:51.233 --> 07:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: Pope Francis,
who Pell said he talked things
over with, later presided

07:55.966 --> 07:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over mass in St. Peter's Square.

07:58.666 --> 08:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Aussies in the square
today wanted God's
truth to shine through.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, there's been a
lot of bad press about Pell
in the Australian media.

He is not very well-liked.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of people
are very angry that
the church in Australia
didn't do enough to cover

08:14.900 --> 08:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any of the sex abuse
for many years.

JONATHAN MILLER: A song
by musician Tim Minchin
which pleaded with
the ailing cardinal to

08:26.533 --> 08:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
return to Australia to testify
to the royal commission
went viral last year.

08:39.700 --> 08:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now Cardinal George Pell,
ordained 51 years ago, is coming
home to face his accusers.

08:46.633 --> 08:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will appear before
Melbourne Magistrates'
Court on the 18th of July.

JUDY WOODRUFF: That report
from Jonathan Miller of
Independent Television News.

08:56.633 --> 09:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Russia, five men were found
guilty today in the murder of
opposition leader Boris Nemtsov

09:02.633 --> 09:04.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2015.

09:04.633 --> 09:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One was the man who pulled
the trigger, a former security
officer in the Chechnya region.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Nemtsov's allies say that
authorities have done nothing
to find out who ordered

09:14.533 --> 09:16.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the killing.

09:16.600 --> 09:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump will come face
to face with Russian President
Vladimir Putin next week,

09:20.966 --> 09:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the first time
since taking office.

09:23.566 --> 09:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House and the Kremlin
announced today that they
will meet on the sidelines

09:27.933 --> 09:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the G20 summit in Germany.

09:30.866 --> 09:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Syria and Russian
accused the U.S. today of
making baseless allegations that

09:37.066 --> 09:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Damascus is preparing
a new chemical attack.

09:39.766 --> 09:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The White House issued
the warning on Tuesday.

09:42.366 --> 09:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Syrian state TV today
called the accusation - -
quote -- "devoid of truth."

09:49.400 --> 09:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian Foreign Ministry
accused the U.S. of trying to
destabilize the Syrian regime.

09:52.133 --> 09:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA ZAKHAROVA, Russian Foreign
Ministry (through translator):
The goal of it is obvious:

09:56.000 --> 10:00.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to reanimate the theme
of so-called crimes of
the government and to
return the situation

10:00.033 --> 10:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria to the same dead end
where it has been led by the
West, saying that Assad needs

10:04.866 --> 10:06.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to leave.

10:06.966 --> 10:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, it's
a provocation for the
rebels to commit crimes
linked to mass deaths

10:10.633 --> 10:12.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of civilians.

10:12.666 --> 10:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The State
Department dismissed
the comments from both
governments and said

10:15.300 --> 10:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's no doubt the Syrian
regime has used chemical
weapons in the past.

10:20.100 --> 10:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
the Federal Bureau
of Justice statistics
reports that most hate

10:24.433 --> 10:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crimes over the past
decade went unreported.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's based on a
survey of households.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It found an average of
250,000 hate crimes each
year between 2004 and 2015.

10:37.333 --> 10:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
More than half were
not reported, most
often because they were
handled some other way.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report says that others
decided the incidents
were not important,
or they doubted police

10:48.233 --> 10:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would do anything.

10:50.233 --> 10:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 800 firefighters
are now battling a Northern
Arizona wildfire that's scorched

10:55.133 --> 10:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost 39 square miles.

10:57.466 --> 11:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say that lighter
winds today would help them make
progress on the Goodwin Fire.

11:04.433 --> 11:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Already, evacuations for
one small town outside
Prescott have been lifted.

11:10.033 --> 11:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Major wildfires are also
burning in Utah, Southern
California and Washington state.

11:15.233 --> 11:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dozens of employees at The New
York Times staged a walkout
today against a new round

11:19.633 --> 11:21.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of job cuts.

11:21.733 --> 11:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporters and editors tweeted
pictures of staffers leaving,
as well as signs in support

11:26.466 --> 11:28.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the staff.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The newspaper is considering
restructuring the newsroom,
and possibly laying off half

11:33.366 --> 11:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of its copy editors.

11:35.433 --> 11:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, technology
stocks took another hit, and
pulled the broader market

11:40.033 --> 11:41.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

11:41.700 --> 11:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 167 points
to close at 21287.

11:47.266 --> 11:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq fell 90, and
the S&amp;P 500 gave up 21.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how does President Trump's
latest Twitter attack fit

11:56.400 --> 12:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the character of the American
presidency and does it matter?;
ISIS loses its birthplace

a caliphate three years
ago; firehouses step
up to provide health

12:08.800 --> 12:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
care for those who need
it most; and much more.

12:22.700 --> 12:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump's use of
Twitter has often brought praise
from supporters for reaching

12:27.200 --> 12:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out directly to the
American people.

12:29.600 --> 12:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mr. Trump has also
managed to spark controversy
in 140 characters,
and, today, his tweets

12:35.766 --> 12:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prompted some of the
harshest criticism yet.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our John Yang has more.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI,
Co-Host, "Morning Joe":
President Donald Trump.

12:43.466 --> 12:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As Mika Brzezinski
wrapped up her MSNBC show this
morning, President Trump had

12:49.933 --> 12:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a few choice words for her
and co-host Joe Scarborough.

12:52.766 --> 12:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump said the hosts, whom
he called "low I.Q. Crazy Mika
and Psycho Joe," were speaking

12:59.833 --> 13:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
badly of him, even though
they insisted on joining
him at Mar-a-Lago.

13:04.800 --> 13:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump adding that, at the
time, Brzezinski was "bleeding
badly from a face-lift."

13:09.600 --> 13:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within minutes, Brzezinski
responded, resurrecting
the little hands insult
that had been directed

13:14.533 --> 13:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at him during the 2016
presidential primaries.

13:18.333 --> 13:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump's words ignited
a firestorm, even from
his Republican allies.

13:22.633 --> 13:25.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

LINDSEY GRAHAM (R),
South Carolina: I thought
it was inappropriate,
beneath the office,

13:25.766 --> 13:27.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and not helpful.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: I wish,

REP.

13:32.133 --> 13:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of
the House: I don't see that
as an appropriate comment.

13:34.166 --> 13:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, look, what we're trying
to do around here is improve
tone, the civility of debates.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this obviously
doesn't help do that.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Did you see the
president's tweets about
Mika Brzezinski this morning?

13:41.166 --> 13:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have any
reaction to that?

West Virginia: Distasteful.

13:45.466 --> 13:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And from Democrats.

REP.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRENDA LAWRENCE (D),
Michigan: This is not
acceptable, Mr. President.

13:50.133 --> 13:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Principal Deputy
White House Press Sarah Huckabee
Sanders insisted the president

13:55.033 --> 13:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was just defending himself.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
I don't think that it's a

13:58.633 --> 14:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surprise to anybody that
he fights fire with fire.

14:00.800 --> 14:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's not going to sit back
and be attacked by the liberal
media, Hollywood elites, and

14:06.533 --> 14:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when they hit him,
he's going to hit back.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It recalled
Mr. Trump's past comments
about women, in 2015,
talking about journalist

14:13.600 --> 14:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Megyn Kelly, then of FOX
News, after she moderated
the first Republican debate.

14:17.533 --> 14:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: She gets out
and she starts asking me all

14:20.600 --> 14:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sorts of ridiculous questions,
and, you know, you could see
there was blood coming out of

14:24.400 --> 14:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her eyes, blood coming
out of her whatever.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she was -- in my
opinion, she was off-base.

14:30.533 --> 14:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: "Rolling
Stone" quoted him saying
of rival candidate
Carly Fiorina: "Look at

14:38.933 --> 14:39.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that face.

14:39.933 --> 14:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would anyone vote for that?"

14:42.200 --> 14:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there was the 2005
"Access Hollywood" tape.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I just
start kissing them.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like a magnet, kiss, kiss.

14:47.733 --> 14:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't even wait.

14:48.933 --> 14:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when you're a star,
they let you do it.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Grab them by the
(EXPLETIVE DELETED).

14:54.833 --> 14:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

14:57.033 --> 15:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Name-calling was a
staple of Mr. Trump's campaign.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Lyin'
Ted Cruz came today.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I watched little Marco.

15:04.933 --> 15:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would say the co-founder would
be crooked Hillary Clinton.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And it continued
today, as the president of
the United States taunted two

15:14.900 --> 15:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cable television hosts.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

I'm John Yang.

JUDY WOODRUFF: For more now on
the president's comments today
and earlier and the implications

15:25.666 --> 15:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what he says publicly,
we turn to Matthew Dowd.

15:27.666 --> 15:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the former chief strategist
for President George W. Bush
in 2004 and author of "A New

as We Lead and Serve."

15:37.066 --> 15:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Beverly Gage, she's
professor of American
history at Yale University.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you
back to the "NewsHour."

15:44.533 --> 15:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Matt Dowd, I'm going
to start with you.

15:46.633 --> 15:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know we have seen
politicians get into some
tough language over the years.

15:53.566 --> 15:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does what we heard from
President Trump today on
Twitter fit into all of that?

15:56.633 --> 16:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD, Former Bush
Campaign Strategist: Well, we
have come a long way from when I

16:00.366 --> 16:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worked for George W. Bush in
2000, when he pledged to bring
honor and dignity back to

16:04.133 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Oval Office and won as that
as being part of his platform.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Judy, I think this
is a bigger problem.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, as you know, in this
democracy, in order to have
a healthy democracy, we have

16:13.166 --> 16:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get to the common good.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the only way to get to
the common good is if we have
a common set of facts, which

16:18.266 --> 16:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we don't seem to have
today, and we have a
common level of decency.

16:21.533 --> 16:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my problem with the
president and what happened
today and why I think it affects

16:25.533 --> 16:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country as a whole
is, first, we bring up
our kids better than this.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We teach them not to do this.

16:30.766 --> 16:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We tell them not to do
this, and it is not the
right standard of behavior.

16:33.266 --> 16:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for a president -- secondly,
but, for a president, he
sets the pattern of behavior

16:37.300 --> 16:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the entire country and what
we can expect for how we each
other act and how we should

16:41.600 --> 16:43.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be in politics.

16:43.666 --> 16:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, third, just from
a practical aspect of
it, just totally looking
at it pragmatically,

16:49.633 --> 16:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his behavior in this, in the
midst of what he is trying
to do on health care and the

16:51.900 --> 16:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
votes he is trying to get, is
incredibly counterproductive.

16:54.733 --> 16:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, from all of those avenues,
one from a history of our
democracy that is dependent

16:59.033 --> 17:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on a level of decency
that doesn't seem to
be apparent here, but,
two, just practically,

17:03.166 --> 17:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if he wants to get something
done, this makes it harder.

17:05.666 --> 17:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I
want to ask you about that
latter part in a moment.

17:08.300 --> 17:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Beverly Gage, how does what
this president is saying when
these kinds of tweets go out,

17:15.233 --> 17:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how does it compare from
what we have heard from
other presidents over time?

17:18.566 --> 17:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE, Yale University:
Unfortunately, I don't think
that American presidents have

17:22.433 --> 17:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always lived up to the standard
of decency that we have
tended to expect of them, but

17:29.433 --> 17:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think presidents before Trump,
when those moments happened,
they tended to be the exception,

17:33.200 --> 17:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rather than the rule.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there was a famous moment
in 1950 when Harry Truman was
president, and a music critic

17:40.800 --> 17:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrote a very critical piece
about Truman's daughter, who had
just given a singing recital.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Truman fired off this
ferocious letter threatening to
punch the guy out, and telling

17:50.933 --> 17:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him that he was a gutter
snipe and an idiot and he was
going to kick him in the nuts.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

17:55.766 --> 17:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it was pretty
aggressive language.

17:57.800 --> 18:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was a big reaction to
that at the time, a president
kind of attacking a private

18:02.566 --> 18:03.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
citizen.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many people thought
it wasn't dignified.

18:05.933 --> 18:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But nobody would have said
that this is Harry Truman's
mode of being all the time.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was seen as a kind
of authentic moment of
outrage, and not a kind
of permanent presidential

18:15.666 --> 18:18.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
style.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt
Dowd, is there a level
of dignity that Americans
expect from a president?

18:20.933 --> 18:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, is there a defined
or undefined line over which
presidents shouldn't go?

18:28.733 --> 18:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, Americans
expect our president to be human
beings, and as imperfect as all

18:35.233 --> 18:36.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of us are.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They expect us to make
mistakes and all that.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one thing the American
public likes is, if you make a
mistake, you do that, you cross

18:41.833 --> 18:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that line that they expect
you to behave under,
then you apologize or
then you correct that

18:46.433 --> 18:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior and said you have
learned, you are going to do
better, you are going to achieve

18:49.533 --> 18:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
better, and you are
going to serve a higher
purpose than that.

18:52.166 --> 18:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's keep in mind that
Donald Trump didn't
win because of himself.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He won in spite of himself.

18:58.733 --> 19:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A quarter of his voters
voted for Donald Trump
believing he wasn't
presidential and he didn't

19:02.766 --> 19:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the temperament, but they
had hope that he would grow
into the office and become more

19:07.366 --> 19:09.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidential.

19:09.433 --> 19:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That doesn't seem to have
happened, and I don't think it
will happen for a 71-year-old

19:12.433 --> 19:14.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

19:14.466 --> 19:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Beverly,
you know, apropos of what just
Matt just said and what you said

19:16.466 --> 19:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a moment ago, clearly, there
are moments when presidents
have grown angry, they have been

19:20.566 --> 19:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
upset because they
have been criticized.

19:23.100 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So is there some kind of
standard, written or otherwise,
for how a president is to speak

19:28.833 --> 19:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the American people?

19:30.833 --> 19:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: I don't think
there is a written standard,
but I think up until this moment

19:34.733 --> 19:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there have been some
sort of accepted norms
that the president in
particular -- on the

19:40.900 --> 19:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign trail, it's
one thing, right?

19:42.966 --> 19:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a place where people
attack each other when they have
differences of opinion or maybe

19:46.633 --> 19:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even personal attacks
in that venue.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is sort of expected.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There, Trump took it to a
new level as well, I think.

19:54.166 --> 19:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you are the president,
the idea that you cannot rise
to the office, that you would

20:01.133 --> 20:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack private citizens, I think
that that is something that a
lot of people find troubling

20:05.300 --> 20:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and sort of unworthy
of the office.

20:07.266 --> 20:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt Dowd,
clearly this was part and parcel
of the president lashing out

20:11.733 --> 20:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the news media.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was reacting to, I guess,
some of the conversation
this morning on that
program, on cable news.

20:20.133 --> 20:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what is it that the
president -- in any way
does this further the
agenda of the president?

20:27.300 --> 20:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned a minute ago
his health care plan, the fact
that he is trying to get this

20:34.266 --> 20:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care plan through the
Senate, through the Congress,
and this takes all the attention

20:37.433 --> 20:39.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
away from that.

20:39.566 --> 20:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, I
think attributing any
every time somebody --
Donald Trump does this,

20:45.266 --> 20:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump does
this, people attribute
some grand strategy.

20:47.233 --> 20:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what the president
really has is a lack
of impulse control.

20:49.733 --> 20:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has done this throughout,
and it has actually
hurt him in the process.

20:52.833 --> 20:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He won the election,
but, as I say, he won
it in spite of himself.

20:55.900 --> 21:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind, Judy, that there's
votes, three key votes that
are needed in the health care

21:00.466 --> 21:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan, Shelley Moore Capito, Lisa
Murkowski, and Susan Collins.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he attacks a woman
basically in a sexist way.

21:08.900 --> 21:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't argue any otherwise
in the midst of this, a woman
who serves as an anchor on

21:12.700 --> 21:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a television program.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
None of that is going to be
helpful in getting those votes.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it is
counterproductive.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But anybody that goes to Donald
Trump, first of all, nobody
seems like they go to Trump

21:21.733 --> 21:23.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to correct his behavior.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But anyone that goes to Donald
Trump would have to make the
argument, this doesn't help

21:25.833 --> 21:27.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think
Donald Trump cares.

21:29.066 --> 21:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beverly
Gage, does history
shows that Americans are
forgiving of a president

21:32.433 --> 21:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they, I don't know,
go off the rails or however
you want to describe this?

21:39.433 --> 21:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: Well, I think
Americans have often warmed
to a kind of pugilistic style.

21:44.766 --> 21:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So Trump is not the first
president to kind of marshal
this hyper-masculinity, right?

21:50.700 --> 21:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You think of someone
like Theodore Roosevelt
bringing wrestlers into
the White House, et

21:53.800 --> 21:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cetera, or even a figure like
Ronald Reagan, who we tend to
have a much more benign view

21:58.300 --> 22:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of now, but actually
could be quite aggressive
in his rhetoric.

22:01.933 --> 22:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what is different for
Trump is that he is specifically
demeaning women, and he's

22:08.100 --> 22:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demeaning particular women.

22:09.733 --> 22:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard to see how that is
going to be a benefit to him.

22:13.300 --> 22:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand I do think
the record is that often this
has worked as a kind of form

22:17.933 --> 22:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of entertainment.

22:20.033 --> 22:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, it is one of the
things that people liked about
Teddy Roosevelt, this kind of

22:23.900 --> 22:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
man who wasn't going
to take it from anyone.

22:26.333 --> 22:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: So, unfortunately,
I don't think it's clear that
this is going to be something

22:33.833 --> 22:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there is a lot
of incentive to stop.

22:35.866 --> 22:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt, what does
this mean for the president and
his allies in the Republican

22:38.833 --> 22:40.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party?

22:40.900 --> 22:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, I'm just
going to -- one response is,
is, yes, the president -- yes,

22:44.633 --> 22:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American public
loves a fighter, but they
want a fighter that is
fighting on their behalf,

22:48.600 --> 22:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not on their own behalf.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, he has not
connected the dots.

22:51.566 --> 22:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these tweets are no
connection, as we talked about.

22:54.333 --> 22:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is going to actually make
it worse for him to achieve
any legislative platform, as

22:57.766 --> 22:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposed to better.

22:59.266 --> 23:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no connection in
fighting on Americans' behalf.

23:01.500 --> 23:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think you saw today,
and as your piece laid
out, is Republicans
are upset about this,

23:05.466 --> 23:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have grown weary of
this, they know it has made
it more difficult on them.

23:09.366 --> 23:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, as his numbers, as
his approval numbers continue
to drop -- they're at the

23:12.833 --> 23:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lowest level of any president
in his first term or any -- in
any term at this point without

23:17.200 --> 23:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a scandal involved -- I think
it makes it much harder and
it sets up a problem for the

23:23.066 --> 23:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
midterm elections in 2018.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think all of that,
Republicans are nervous about.

23:26.733 --> 23:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But quickly,
Matt, they are still sticking
with him for the most part,

23:30.300 --> 23:31.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aren't they?

23:31.300 --> 23:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: For the most part.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that is one of the
frustrations by many of us.

23:35.266 --> 23:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you can say, oh, just
discount his words and all that.

23:38.266 --> 23:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At some point, they are
going to have to hold Donald
Trump's feet to the fire.

23:41.266 --> 23:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they can do that.

23:42.533 --> 23:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senators can do that and
House members can do it.

23:44.633 --> 23:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They can basically say,
we are not going to
pass an appointment, we
are not going to pass

23:47.000 --> 23:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legislation until you
correct your behavior.

23:49.600 --> 23:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no way right
now we know, or there
is no evidence that we
have that they're willing

23:55.233 --> 23:56.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

23:56.733 --> 23:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that is in the end what
they have control over.

23:57.700 --> 23:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're right.

23:58.666 --> 24:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have not seen that yet.

24:00.433 --> 24:05.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Matthew Dowd, Beverly
Gage, we thank you both.

24:17.433 --> 24:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The battle for the largest
city held by ISIS appears
close to being over.

24:22.266 --> 24:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi government forces captured
an ancient landmark in the
old city of Mosul today, a

24:28.133 --> 24:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
significant symbolic victory.

24:30.233 --> 24:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The militants now hold
very little territory in
the city, once home to
one-and-a-half million

24:35.333 --> 24:36.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraqis.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

24:38.900 --> 24:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For
Iraqi forces, it's clearly
a major victory after
months of block-by-block

24:44.266 --> 24:46.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fighting.

24:46.266 --> 24:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have recaptured Western
Mosul's al-Nuri Mosque compound,
and what remains of its 12th

24:50.166 --> 24:52.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
century minaret.

24:52.166 --> 24:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HASSAN SALEH JABER, Iraqi
Military (through translator):
We stormed the area in the early

24:54.733 --> 24:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours of the morning from
different directions.

24:57.100 --> 25:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We stormed the mosque and
secured the area, and operations
are going on to fully clear

25:01.200 --> 25:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and search the area.

25:03.300 --> 25:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The compound
was blown up by ISIS fighters
last week as they retreated,

25:06.933 --> 25:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that did little to diminish
the symbolism of today's events.

25:10.666 --> 25:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, Iraqi Prime
Minister Haider al-Abadi said:
"It marks the end of the ISIS

25:16.400 --> 25:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state of falsehood."

25:18.733 --> 25:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In July 2014, the ISIS
leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,
stood in the al-Nuri
Mosque just weeks after

25:25.533 --> 25:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his forces seized the city
and announced the formation of
a so-called caliphate across

25:30.966 --> 25:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much of Iraq and Syria.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI, ISIS
Leader (through translator):
God has granted your brothers,

25:35.966 --> 25:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mujahideen, victory and a
conquest after years of patience
and holy struggle, and enabled

25:41.833 --> 25:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to achieve their objective.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There
have been recent claims
from the Russians and the
Iranians that al-Baghdadi

25:47.366 --> 25:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been killed, but the
U.S. hasn't confirmed that.

25:50.866 --> 25:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now his group now holds
less than one square
mile of territory in
the western half of the

25:55.466 --> 25:57.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of Mosul's Old City remains
under ISIS control, as does a
key nearby hospital complex.

26:03.366 --> 26:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon
is a spokesman for the coalition
that's supporting Iraqi

26:06.500 --> 26:07.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
forces, the ISF.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN DILLON, Operation
Inherent Resolve Spokesman:
The Old City still remains
a difficult, dense,

26:11.866 --> 26:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suffocating fight.

26:13.900 --> 26:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tight alleyways with
booby-traps, civilians,
and ISIS fighters
around every corner make

26:19.466 --> 26:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the ISF's advance
extremely challenging.

26:21.933 --> 26:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last October,
Iraqi units and their allies
opened the campaign to retake

26:26.900 --> 26:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mosul, and captured
the eastern half of the
city by late January.

26:31.166 --> 26:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The assault on Western
Mosul began in February.

26:34.600 --> 26:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Even now, it's believed
thousands of people are
still trapped there.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Yes, there many families there
still, hundreds of families

26:43.600 --> 26:44.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all around.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's miserable.

26:45.733 --> 26:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no bread
or water at all.

26:47.700 --> 26:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These months
of battle have displaced
more than 850,000 people.

26:54.100 --> 26:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds arrived today at a
processing center run by Iraqi
forces as they attempted to flee

26:57.500 --> 26:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for refugee camps.

26:59.600 --> 27:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Military trucks carried
men, women and children
out, as others tried
to make their way back

27:03.900 --> 27:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in to newly reclaimed areas.

27:06.533 --> 27:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Our
neighborhood was liberated
more than three months ago.

27:13.466 --> 27:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We fled even before the
liberation of our neighborhood
and ISIS was chasing us from

27:16.433 --> 27:18.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
house to house.

27:18.833 --> 27:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
in Syria, U.S.-backed
Kurdish fighters have
seized the last road

27:24.066 --> 27:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into Raqqa, the Islamic State's
self-proclaimed capital.

27:27.666 --> 27:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Syrian Democratic Forces
are now in control of all
major routes into the city.

27:33.833 --> 27:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

27:39.833 --> 27:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a health
care story about providing
help to those who need it most.

27:52.433 --> 27:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even as the debate over
replacing the Affordable
Care Act continues,
one California city has

27:58.933 --> 28:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
come up with an
innovative solution to
an intractable problem.

28:02.066 --> 28:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent
Kathleen McCleery reports
from Alameda County.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: On the south
edge of the city of Hayward sits
a neighborhood with especially

28:12.300 --> 28:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high rates of poverty,
unemployment and violent crime.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are sicker, too.

28:17.366 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many suffer from
diabetes, obesity, asthma
and other ailments.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Options for care
here are limited.

28:23.466 --> 28:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's just one hospital,
and few doctors welcome
Medicaid patients.

28:29.566 --> 28:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some call it a
health care desert.

28:31.633 --> 28:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE, Former Director,
Alameda County Health Care
Services: South Hayward is the

28:32.900 --> 28:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
poster child for lack of
access to primary care.

28:34.866 --> 28:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: When Alex
Briscoe was with Alameda County
Health Care Services -- he

28:38.900 --> 28:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was agency director for six
years -- he hunted for ways
to improve access to care.

28:45.900 --> 28:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2009, as he coped with the
swine flu, or H1N1, epidemic,
Briscoe had a light bulb moment.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: Firefighters
joined our public health nurses
and many other providers, and

28:56.600 --> 29:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we very successfully
vaccinated, immunized hundreds
of thousands of people.

29:00.566 --> 29:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Airway aids
and tracheal tubes.

29:03.500 --> 29:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Briscoe
wondered if firefighters
skilled as trained
paramedics could help solve

29:09.700 --> 29:11.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another piece of the
health care puzzle.

29:11.666 --> 29:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: This H1N1
experience, combined with our
already robust relationship with

29:15.833 --> 29:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fire on the EMS system,
it's kind of like peanut
butter and chocolate.

29:22.733 --> 29:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do these two ideas go together,
and is there a way for us
to use this already existing

29:24.633 --> 29:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resource and preexisting
trust as well?

29:27.733 --> 29:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Trust,
because approval ratings for
firefighters far exceed other

29:32.333 --> 29:34.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public servants.

29:34.466 --> 29:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That got officials here
thinking about how to leverage
manpower and location.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kristel Acacio runs special
projects for the county agency.

29:44.066 --> 29:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO, Alameda County
Health Care Services Agency:
Fire stations, firefighters

29:47.166 --> 29:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are strategically located
in every community.

29:50.033 --> 29:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we saw this as an existing,
but perhaps untapped resource
to serve our patient population.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Around the fire station,
there is a concentration
of low-income residents.

30:03.066 --> 30:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: When Acacio
examined data about that
population, she discovered that

30:07.866 --> 30:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the neediest area was just
where the county planned to
build a new fire station.

30:12.133 --> 30:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO: And what we
can see in this map is that
in Hayward, and in particular

30:16.200 --> 30:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in South Hayward, that
the concentration of
avoidable emergency
department visits is 1.5

30:23.166 --> 30:25.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
times or greater
the county rate.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: County
health officials seized the
chance to collaborate with the

30:28.533 --> 30:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city, a community health center
and a nonprofit architectural
firm to design and build two

30:34.400 --> 30:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
structures on the same campus.

30:36.666 --> 30:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They opened in late 2015.

30:39.133 --> 30:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The clinic is right in
front of us, and the fire
station is right here.

30:42.066 --> 30:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARRETT CONTRERAS, Hayward Fire
Chief: Yes, the same style.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They look integrated, and
basically taking advantage of
that sort of known trust and

30:50.633 --> 30:52.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
location.

30:52.733 --> 30:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Fire
chief Garrett Contreras was
a supporter from the start.

30:56.200 --> 31:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARRETT CONTRERAS: Upwards of
70 percent of our 911 calls
in the Hayward Fire Department

31:00.333 --> 31:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are for medical emergencies.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of these more routine-type
medical problems can be treated
at a much lower-cost setting

31:09.133 --> 31:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and keep the emergency
room beds available for
our most critical patients.

31:13.566 --> 31:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Reducing
the number of transports to
the E.R. is one way to measure

31:17.633 --> 31:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success, says David B.
Vliet, CEO of the Tiburcio
Vasquez Health Center,
which runs eight community

31:24.533 --> 31:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clinics, including this one.

31:26.666 --> 31:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID B. VLIET, CEO, Tiburcio
Vasquez Health Center: Because
we have delivered 6,000 urgent

31:29.066 --> 31:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care, convenient care visits
here, those are visits that
didn't go to the E.R., so right

31:35.666 --> 31:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
away we know we have
kept that volume out
of the emergency room.

31:38.133 --> 31:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: But
not everything went
according to plan.

31:41.166 --> 31:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTEL ACACIO: Initially, what
we wanted the firefighters to
do was that we could possibly

31:45.566 --> 31:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dedicate a couple paramedics
to actually work in the clinic.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: That idea
was quickly squelched by the
California Nurses Association.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Karen Rothblatt has been
a nurse for 30 years.

31:58.066 --> 32:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN ROTHBLATT, California
Nurses Association: You wouldn't
want me to come and respond to

32:01.133 --> 32:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you in that critical
first moment.

32:04.266 --> 32:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not what my
training is about.

32:06.766 --> 32:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Same, turn that around, I
think you could say that a
paramedic hasn't been trained to

32:11.333 --> 32:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do what a nurse has been
trained to do, so why would
you have them do that?

32:17.466 --> 32:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it would be
putting people at risk.

32:18.933 --> 32:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: My first thought
is the "Family Feud sound.

32:22.533 --> 32:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, no nurse would say that
while a paramedic is trache-ing
them or starting an I.V. line

32:29.433 --> 32:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paramedics are extremely highly
trained, and highly skilled,
and I think that they can

32:32.033 --> 32:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do far more than what they're
currently doing, if we remember
that the point of our health

32:37.033 --> 32:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care delivery system is to
serve people, not to protect
health care market share.

32:43.433 --> 32:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN ROTHBLATT: Well, I find
that insulting, actually.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are jobs out
there for nurses.

32:46.133 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not about that.

32:48.500 --> 32:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really, really about
making sure that that clinic
really functions in a way that

32:54.633 --> 32:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is best for the patients
that arrive there.

32:57.600 --> 33:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: At
the clinic, patients
are seen by a nurse
practitioner or physician's

33:04.966 --> 33:06.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assistant.

33:06.666 --> 33:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
No doctor is on staff
yet, but they say they
are hiring one soon.

33:13.133 --> 33:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Firefighters are close by if
the clinic needs lifesaving
care for heart attacks, strokes

33:15.933 --> 33:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or to get patients to a
fully staffed emergency room.

33:19.933 --> 33:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And proximity promotes
communication, too.

33:23.433 --> 33:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those in the field, like Captain
LaShon Earnest, encourage
people to use the clinic.

33:28.433 --> 33:31.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
CAPT.

33:31.066 --> 33:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LASHON EARNEST, Hayward
Fire Department: We go on
a lot of calls where we
can make a determination

33:33.566 --> 33:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where somebody who doesn't
necessarily need to go
to the emergency room,
the tax the system.

33:39.933 --> 33:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For something -- say,
for a stubbed toe, this
is someone that could
probably use the clinic.

33:41.666 --> 33:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, did you know the
clinic was right next
door to the firehouse?

33:43.900 --> 33:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, I didn't know that.

33:45.466 --> 33:47.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, maybe I'm fine
right now, I don't need
to go to the hospital.

33:48.600 --> 33:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will have my mother drive
me tomorrow to the clinic.

33:52.266 --> 33:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Tina
Greives lost her insurance
after an on-the- job
injury as a long-distance

33:58.066 --> 33:59.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trucker.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For her, the location, next to
the fire station, is convenient.

34:02.733 --> 34:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA GREIVES, Patient: I don't
have a vehicle, which is unusual
for somebody in California.

34:07.566 --> 34:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one is just seriously
within walking distance if
I'm doing good, or a 15-minute

34:13.166 --> 34:14.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bus ride.

34:14.133 --> 34:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's in a perfect location.

34:16.100 --> 34:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: Greives,
like most treated in this
clinic, qualifies for Medicaid.

34:23.066 --> 34:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 120,000 people in
Alameda County were added to
the rolls with the passage of

34:26.833 --> 34:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

34:28.900 --> 34:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The uncertainty over health
care in Washington is causing
worry here in South Hayward.

34:33.533 --> 34:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cuts to Medicaid could reduce
a key funding stream for this
clinic, keeping it from being

34:38.366 --> 34:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
self-sustaining in
the coming years.

34:41.033 --> 34:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a concern for
providers and patients alike.

34:43.933 --> 34:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA GREIVES: I wouldn't
be covered by the new bill.

34:47.633 --> 34:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's all there is to it, and
it's just like, holy dirty word.

34:53.700 --> 34:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's an uncertainty,
and it's scary.

34:57.066 --> 35:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID B. VLIET: Ultimately, it
means that more folks cannot
be seen in a health center

35:03.600 --> 35:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like this, and would
not have a paying source
in order to do that.

35:07.266 --> 35:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: The
partnership of firefighters
and health care workers
is a first for California.

35:14.266 --> 35:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX BRISCOE: The attempt to
bridge the 911 system and the
primary care system, I think

35:16.433 --> 35:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's a unique experiment.

35:17.933 --> 35:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARRETT CONTRERAS: I do
believe it can be a model.

35:19.433 --> 35:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do believe it will
be -- can be repeated.

35:22.733 --> 35:25.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not easy.

35:25.266 --> 35:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not so easy to do to get
multiple governmental
agencies to work together,
drop the boundaries,

35:30.766 --> 35:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drop the egos, drop the who said
what, who's doing what, who's
getting credit for anything,

35:37.100 --> 35:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and just do it because
it's the right thing
to do and it'll improve
service to the community.

35:39.366 --> 35:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN MCCLEERY: I'm Kathleen
McCleery for the "PBS NewsHour"
in Hayward, California.

35:49.400 --> 35:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

35:56.966 --> 36:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
why a deadly disaster is
bringing to light the problem

36:01.266 --> 36:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of gas and oil wells near homes;
and journalist Ann Friedman
gives her Brief But Spectacular

36:08.033 --> 36:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take on finding her voice.

36:11.333 --> 36:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: A key part of
President Trump's campaign was
pledging to restore prosperity

36:15.833 --> 36:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and to ease the anxiety
for those left behind
by globalization.

36:22.433 --> 36:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Income inequality was a
problem during President
Obama's tenure, too.

36:25.433 --> 36:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The trend began well
before either took office.

36:29.533 --> 36:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the widening gap here
is connected to growth in
other parts of the world.

36:34.266 --> 36:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, has been exploring
those trends, and it's

36:38.200 --> 36:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the focus of his weekly
segment, Making Sense.

36:40.833 --> 36:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRANKO MILANOVIC, City
University of New York:
The good news is that
people around this point

36:44.933 --> 36:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A, like one third of the
global population, have
done really quite well.

36:49.266 --> 36:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At the
City University of New
York Graduate Center,
economist Branko Milanovic

36:53.866 --> 36:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the hottest curve
in economics right now,
charting the climb of a
billion out of poverty,

37:00.900 --> 37:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and explaining the rise of
China, the rise of populism
in Europe, the rise of Donald

37:05.933 --> 37:08.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

37:08.033 --> 37:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thanks to its pachydermal
profile, and Twitter, it has
an almost unforgettable name:

37:13.200 --> 37:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Elephant Chart.

37:15.333 --> 37:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: I remember
in June 2012, the first time
that I saw what later became

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Elephant Chart, I
was immediately struck,
because I thought, well,
that's exactly what

37:24.866 --> 37:26.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we all knew.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what
is it that we knew?

37:28.066 --> 37:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: Well, we knew
that China and large groups
of people in Asia who were

37:30.900 --> 37:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not very rich compared
to Americans, who
have done very well.

37:34.333 --> 37:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We knew that lower- and
middle-class Americans
and Japanese and Germans
have not done well,

37:41.266 --> 37:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then we also knew that
the top 1 percent in the rich
countries have done well.

37:44.966 --> 37:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, at the risk
of Dumbo-ing this down, let's
take the Elephant Chart from

37:49.600 --> 37:51.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tail to tusk.

37:51.733 --> 37:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we have to head
into the wild blue yonder
of my producer's basement.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the bottom, the horizontal
axis is the entire world
population, arranged by their

38:03.700 --> 38:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incomes back in 1988, poorest
over here to the left,
the richest to the right.

38:09.600 --> 38:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just past the middle, at
about the 55th percentile,
a family of four with
$3,000 a year after-tax

38:16.600 --> 38:18.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
income.

38:18.566 --> 38:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Middle-class U.S. family taking
home $30,000 a year would
land about here, at the 80th

38:24.800 --> 38:26.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
percentile.

38:26.766 --> 38:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in 1988, $160,000 of
after-tax income would've lifted
you into the global 1 percent.

38:34.333 --> 38:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the vertical axis, going
from bottom to top, is how
much income grew, in percentage

38:40.466 --> 38:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terms, over 20 years,
from 1988 to 2008.

38:43.500 --> 38:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two winning groups,
the fabled 1 percent and
those in the middle of
the income distribution.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As for the poorest, they
had about a 10 percent rise.

38:58.966 --> 39:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: If they
started with like $2 a day,
now they have $2.3 a day.

39:03.466 --> 39:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But now what
this story is telling us
is, here, at the middle
of the income distribution

39:10.866 --> 39:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
globally, those people have
almost doubled their income
in real terms after taxes.

39:16.900 --> 39:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: Right.

39:17.966 --> 39:18.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

39:18.966 --> 39:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
After taxes, yes.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And as you can see, this is
not a small group of people.

39:22.166 --> 39:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So we are talking about
people from the 40th
percentile to the 70th.

39:25.933 --> 39:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is almost like one-third
of the global population who
have done really quite well.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And who are
we talking about here?

39:34.266 --> 39:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are the Indians in
Bangalore, the Brazilian
middle class, the South
Koreans, the Chinese,

39:40.633 --> 39:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who've flocked from the
countryside to the cities.

39:42.566 --> 39:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: There was
a large chunk of people,
two-and-a-half billion, who have

39:45.633 --> 39:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done extremely well.

39:47.700 --> 39:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And those are
the people up at the top of
the back of the elephant.

39:50.233 --> 39:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: Top of
the back of the elephant,
so basically what is
called resurgent Asia.

39:53.366 --> 39:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Resurgent
Asia, indeed.

39:55.066 --> 39:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, you may have seen
one of the most popular
Ted Talks of all time.

39:58.833 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HANS ROSLING, Swedish Academic:
Income per person on this
axis, poor down here, rich

40:02.700 --> 40:05.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up there.

40:05.133 --> 40:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The late great
Hans Rosling depicting
this phenomenon in his
own inimitably graphic

40:09.166 --> 40:11.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HANS ROSLING: You see
China under foreign
domination actually
lowered their income and

40:13.733 --> 40:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
came down to the Indian level
here, whereas U.K. and United
States is getting richer and

40:20.333 --> 40:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
richer, and after Second
World War, United States
is richer than U.K.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But independence is coming here.

40:24.266 --> 40:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Growth is starting,
economic reform.

40:26.266 --> 40:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Growth is faster.

40:28.333 --> 40:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, the good news
is that income inequality has,
from a global perspective,

40:31.233 --> 40:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone down, as the incomes in
the developing world rise,
catching up with incomes in the

40:37.100 --> 40:38.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
developed world.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a point the Elephant
Chart is often used to make.

40:40.633 --> 40:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But perhaps the chart's most
memorable message of the moment
is the crisis of inequality

40:47.733 --> 40:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the very well-developed
world, the hollowing
out of the middle class
in France, the United

40:52.400 --> 40:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kingdom and especially the
United States of America.

40:55.066 --> 40:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, at incomes of about
$20,000 to $100,000 a
year, inflation-adjusted,
there's been negligible

41:02.900 --> 41:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
income growth for decades.

41:06.333 --> 41:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once you get to the 70th
percentile, so you're
the richest 30 percent
of the world's income

41:12.966 --> 41:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
distribution, it
falls off a cliff.

41:15.633 --> 41:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: True.

41:18.166 --> 41:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was really people who
are generally dissatisfied
with their economic
position and who feel

41:20.900 --> 41:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatened by migration and
who feel threatened by lack
of jobs or insecurity of jobs.

41:27.800 --> 41:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you look at actually who
are voting for Le Pen in France,
who voted for Brexit, and

41:32.033 --> 41:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then -- and Trump, we saw
that this sort of growth of
right-wing populism is driven on

41:39.000 --> 41:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one hand by this insecurity
of jobs, which is a result of
globalization, and by migration,

41:44.400 --> 41:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is also part and
parcel of globalization.

41:46.733 --> 41:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And globalization
was supposed to be win-win
for everyone, wasn't it?

41:53.666 --> 41:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: One thing was
promised to them essentially,
with globalization, they

41:55.333 --> 41:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would all get better off.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then gradually they see
that their wages are stagnant,
and they have been stagnant

42:01.133 --> 42:03.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for 25 years.

42:03.066 --> 42:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The rich getting
richer, the trunk of the
elephant tilted skyward.

42:06.500 --> 42:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, you look
backwards, and then you see that
these people might be catching

42:11.500 --> 42:13.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to you.

42:13.533 --> 42:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANKO MILANOVIC: Yes, right,
because they actually are
coming on the big tide, like

42:15.700 --> 42:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a wave, and then really your
relative position is going to
really slide down quite quickly.

42:20.433 --> 42:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And so we end
with the jumbo takeaway, that
while a rising middle class

42:27.333 --> 42:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the developing world has
been narrowing global inequality
for decades, the story has

42:33.333 --> 42:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been just the opposite closer to
home, and fueling a reaction as
radical as it is understandable.

42:38.766 --> 42:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting from

42:42.633 --> 42:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the City University of New York
and my producer's basement.

42:46.633 --> 42:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're
just glad you're safe, Paul.

42:49.433 --> 42:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's more of
Paul's conversation
with economist Branko
Milanovic on our Web site.

42:55.666 --> 42:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can find it at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

43:09.866 --> 43:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Colorado is taking a close
look at all oil and gas
operations across the state.

43:16.866 --> 43:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That follows a fatal explosion
in April at home in the Denver
suburb of Firestone caused

43:20.966 --> 43:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by a leaking
underground gas line.

43:24.033 --> 43:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow is the deadline set
by the governor for companies
to complete inspection of oil

43:28.166 --> 43:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and gas lines all near
homes and businesses.

43:31.400 --> 43:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The accident has revived the
debate over how drilling can
coexist with growing suburban

43:37.633 --> 43:39.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
development.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dan Boyce with Public Media's
Inside Energy reports.

43:41.533 --> 43:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAYLE MERTZ, Firestone
Resident: I don't have the
vocabulary to describe it.

43:45.366 --> 43:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was just a massive,
massive explosion.

43:47.900 --> 43:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Firestone resident
Gayle Mertz was in her
backyard when it happened.

43:54.666 --> 43:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But neighbors inside
their homes felt it too.

43:57.066 --> 43:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: Like, our whole house
shook, and like, jumped.

43:59.900 --> 44:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: One single blast
leveled the Martinez home
over on Twilight Avenue.

44:07.300 --> 44:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the home began burning,
parents, including
Laura Goodwin, grabbed
up their children and

44:11.666 --> 44:13.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evacuated.

44:13.666 --> 44:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAURA GOODWIN, Firestone
Resident: And, really,
we thought that we
weren't going back.

44:15.666 --> 44:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: The blast killed
Mark Martinez and his
brother-in-law Joey Irwin.

44:21.133 --> 44:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Martinez's wife, Erin,
was hospitalized with
serious injuries.

44:25.100 --> 44:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Following the explosion,
Anadarko Petroleum, Colorado's
largest oil producer, announced

44:31.300 --> 44:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it had voluntarily shut
down 3,000 nearby wells.

44:37.733 --> 44:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Within another week, Firestone
Fire Chief Ted Poszywak
confirmed the swirling rumors.

44:43.033 --> 44:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The explosion was caused
by gas that entered the
home through the basement.

44:46.733 --> 44:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED POSZYWAK, Firestone
Fire Chief: Due to a
cut and abandoned line
attached to an oil

44:49.533 --> 44:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and gas well in the vicinity.

44:51.566 --> 44:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Basically, odorless
gas seeped in through the
basement and the family had

44:55.500 --> 44:56.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
no idea.

44:56.966 --> 45:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was from a well 178 feet
from the Martinez home.

45:04.433 --> 45:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not an uncommon site
in Northern Colorado,
and other parts of the
country, such as Texas

45:07.100 --> 45:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Pennsylvania, surging
populations leading
to the construction
of new homes near and

45:14.233 --> 45:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on top of land previously the
domain of the oil industry.

45:21.133 --> 45:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The collision of those two
sectors has led to political
uproar in Colorado over the last

45:24.566 --> 45:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
few years, communities
banning drilling, judges
throwing out those bans.

45:31.600 --> 45:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State law now requires new
oil wells be drilled at
least 500 feet from homes.

45:38.300 --> 45:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Lisa McKenzie, a
professor at the University
of Colorado School of
Public Health, has been

45:44.300 --> 45:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
researching this for years,
and she says it's not drilling
new wells near homes that's the

45:49.033 --> 45:51.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
only problem.

45:51.533 --> 45:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA MCKENZIE, University
of Colorado School of
Public Health: It was
actually more common

45:53.566 --> 45:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for homes to be built
near to where an oil and
gas well already existed.

45:56.933 --> 46:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN BOYCE: In fact,
Inside Energy analysis
has found, between 2010
and 2015, the number

46:03.833 --> 46:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people living in areas
with more than 10 wells per
square mile increased by nearly

46:10.166 --> 46:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50,000 in Colorado, most
noticeably along the Front
Range north of Denver.

46:16.666 --> 46:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while the state
mandates that 500-foot
setback for new wells,
there's no state regulation

46:22.533 --> 46:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for how far new homes
must be constructed from
already existing oil wells.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laura Goodwin says she bought
her home with the understanding
that utilities and oil and

46:36.666 --> 46:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gas companies were doing
everything they could to
protect nearby families.

46:40.366 --> 46:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA GOODWIN: That's why they
get to drill, that's why they
get the oil, that's why get

46:44.200 --> 46:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the permits, is because
they are supposed to keep
the people around it safe.

46:50.033 --> 46:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they didn't do it.

46:52.666 --> 46:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: In the wake of
the explosion, Colorado
Governor John Hickenlooper
ordered oil companies

46:58.366 --> 47:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inspect all underground oil
and gas lines within 1,000
feet of occupied buildings.

47:03.466 --> 47:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says this all used to be
open farmland and the location
of underground oil and gas

47:10.000 --> 47:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
pipes was known only to
the oil companies and
the property owners.

47:13.733 --> 47:15.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), Colorado:
And now we can see that
sometimes that property gets

47:17.333 --> 47:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sold, and next thing you
know, you're building
a housing development.

47:20.500 --> 47:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How could we not know where
the flow lines are, have a
map and a record of them?

47:24.966 --> 47:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Hickenlooper
expects GPS data provided
by oil companies through
the required inspections

47:32.433 --> 47:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should allow the state to
provide a comprehensive
map of all flow lines
for the first time.

47:39.266 --> 47:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anadarko owns the leaking well
responsible for the explosion.

47:43.300 --> 47:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're holding community
meetings and now offering free
gas detectors to any home in

47:49.500 --> 47:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the neighborhood as
a way to calm fears.

47:51.900 --> 47:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still, that hasn't stopped
about 100 of these homeowners
from launching lawsuits against

47:58.833 --> 48:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the oil company, as well as
the developer and builder
of the Martinez home.

48:04.033 --> 48:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Anadarko turned down
our interview requests,
but Colorado Oil and Gas
Association president

48:10.233 --> 48:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dan Haley says, as tragic as
this accident is, the public
can still feel confident in

48:14.600 --> 48:16.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his industry.

48:16.633 --> 48:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN HALEY, President, Colorado
Oil and Gas Association: We
have been operating in Colorado

48:18.133 --> 48:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for longer than we have been
a state, more than 100 years.

48:20.233 --> 48:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have drilled tens
of thousands of wells.

48:22.833 --> 48:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have logged millions
of manhours out in
the field working.

48:27.333 --> 48:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is a safe industry.

48:28.733 --> 48:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is not to excuse
what happened.

48:31.466 --> 48:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not to forget or pretend
that two people didn't die.

48:35.333 --> 48:37.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They did.

48:37.033 --> 48:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need to do all we
can do to make sure it
doesn't happen again.

48:39.666 --> 48:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Some Colorado
lawmakers are now calling for
much larger distances between

48:46.100 --> 48:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
homes and wells, something still
staunchly opposed by industry.

48:49.166 --> 48:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And speak to home builders,
they say setbacks like that
are just not practical.

48:56.033 --> 48:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gregory Miedema works
with a local home builders
trade association.

48:59.900 --> 49:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says with all the wells,
54,000 active wells statewide,
you can't really go somewhere

49:06.133 --> 49:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where you're not
building next to one.

49:08.666 --> 49:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY MIEDEMA, Northern
Colorado Home Builders
Association: I mean,
quite frankly, you have

49:10.166 --> 49:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be prudent and safe about
your distances, but you can't.

49:12.300 --> 49:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you were to rule out all
the land that were next to a
well, you would rule it all

49:15.566 --> 49:18.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

49:18.133 --> 49:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: He says he's
not against any setbacks,
but the more land you
rule out, the more you

49:22.700 --> 49:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
raise housing prices
on what's left.

49:24.966 --> 49:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the last
thing Colorado needs.

49:27.733 --> 49:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prices around here are
already rising at some of the
fastest rates in the country.

49:31.700 --> 49:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least for now, there's
still plenty of demand for
new housing in the area.

49:35.433 --> 49:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, if you look
right behind the site
of the explosion, you
can see construction

49:41.766 --> 49:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a brand-new apartment
complex, with nearly 300 units.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But leaking gas lines are not
the only hazard, and just five
weeks after the explosion:

49:52.700 --> 49:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We start with breaking
news, explosion and fire at
an oil and gas site once again

49:57.733 --> 49:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rocking Weld County.

49:59.700 --> 50:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN BOYCE: Less than four miles
away from the Martinez home,
an Anadarko-owned oil tank

50:04.000 --> 50:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
burst into flames.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It happened during
a maintenance check.

50:07.933 --> 50:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This explosion killed one
worker and injured three others.

50:12.333 --> 50:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The oil and gas industry can be
hazardous, 42 deaths nationwide
from fires and explosions

50:19.233 --> 50:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
between 2010 and 2014.

50:21.600 --> 50:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But a house explosion
raises whole new fears.

50:25.166 --> 50:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now it's up to the state
regulators and oil companies
to do whatever they can to make

50:31.566 --> 50:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these residents feel safe
again in their homes.

50:35.800 --> 50:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Dan
Boyce in Firestone, Colorado.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, our Brief
But Spectacular series, where
we ask interesting people to

50:55.266 --> 50:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
describe their passions.

50:57.366 --> 51:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, journalist Ann
Friedman, co-host of
the podcast "Call Your
Girlfriend," explores

51:03.033 --> 51:05.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why it's important to
find your own voice.

51:05.333 --> 51:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN FRIEDMAN, Journalist: Women
are frequently asked to couch
their opinions in a lot of

51:09.566 --> 51:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
filler words, which is why
I find it so interesting
that we are simultaneously
seen as unserious

51:16.600 --> 51:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when we use phrases like um,
you know, or like, because,
frankly, if you say things

51:20.633 --> 51:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directly, without a lot of "oh,
you know what I think" sort
of padding around them, it's

51:27.066 --> 51:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
difficult for both
men and women to hear.

51:29.100 --> 51:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's just men
that have a hard time hearing
direct especially criticism when

51:34.600 --> 51:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's coming from a woman.

51:36.633 --> 51:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Knowing it doesn't really
change the fact that, like,
in the real world, women have

51:39.966 --> 51:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do a lot more emotional
labor to convey their opinions
and decisions and ideas.

51:46.933 --> 51:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am one of those boring people
who has only wanted to do
one thing for my entire life,

51:55.266 --> 51:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which is be a journalist.

51:57.233 --> 52:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's pretty impossible to equip
someone for a 10-plus-year
career in media right now.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to get fired
or laid off at some point.

52:03.100 --> 52:04.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It will happen.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And you probably are
going to have to learn
a bunch of new skills.

52:07.500 --> 52:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You probably are going to have
to come to terms with the fact
that you're not only going

52:10.500 --> 52:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to write long-form
magazine articles in the
style of 1960s "Esquire."

52:14.600 --> 52:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I didn't wake up one day
and say, you know what,
I should have a podcast.

52:19.333 --> 52:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have a good friend
here called Gina Delvac.

52:21.833 --> 52:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had said for a long time
to me and to my friend Aminatou
Sow, hey, you guys have

52:28.266 --> 52:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a great chemistry, you would
be great podcast co-hosts.

52:30.033 --> 52:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it was somewhere around
where we came up with the name.

52:37.066 --> 52:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess we just create a fun,
safe place for ourselves and
discuss the things that we are

52:45.500 --> 52:47.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interested in.

52:47.466 --> 52:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it turns out that a lot
of other women are interested
in those things, too.

52:51.300 --> 52:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voice is one of those things
that when you talk about it
in a classroom or with a group

52:56.000 --> 52:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of writers, it can feel
very big and abstract.

52:58.400 --> 53:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, when I was earlier in
my career, I had more doubts
about my validity as a writer

53:04.133 --> 53:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a journalist.

53:06.133 --> 53:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I made my more effort to
copy the tone of the places
that I was writing for, inasmuch

53:08.900 --> 53:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as they had an
institutional tone.

53:11.033 --> 53:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the longer that I had been
working and the more confident
in my opinions or my reporting

53:15.600 --> 53:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or, frankly, like, my career
and my place in the world,
it gets easier to write the

53:20.066 --> 53:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way that I speak.

53:22.266 --> 53:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If someone can't hear
the substance of what
I'm saying because of
the tone I say it with

53:24.966 --> 53:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or because of the little filler
words that I use -- which,
P.S., men use, too, we all

53:29.466 --> 53:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use -- then that's
their problem.

53:31.566 --> 53:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Ann Friedman, and
this is my Brief But Spectacular
take on finding your voice

53:36.133 --> 53:37.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in journalism.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just
say it, that's the message.

53:40.200 --> 53:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Things," Indian writer
Arundhati Roy is out with
