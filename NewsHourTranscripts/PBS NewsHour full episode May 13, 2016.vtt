JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.373 --> 00:11.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
White House
kicks up an already hot issue by
directing

00:11.411 --> 00:17.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all public schools to allow
transgender students
to use the bathroom matching
their gender

00:17.918 --> 00:19.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
identity.

00:19.753 --> 00:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: how one man's mission to
reform the
nation's justice system began by
confronting

00:24.324 --> 00:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alabama's overcrowded prisons.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON, Founder, Equal
Justice Initiative:
If you said to any warden in the
state of

00:29.830 --> 00:34.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama, can you identify 50,
100, 200 people
in your prison who you think
could go home

00:34.568 --> 00:37.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, wouldn't be a problem,
most of them
could do it in a heartbeat.

00:37.938 --> 00:42.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and Michael Gerson talk about
the possibility

00:42.743 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a united Republican Party and
analyze a
full week of news.

00:47.915 --> 00:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.655 --> 00:57.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.457 --> 01:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The political and
social struggle
over bathrooms and gender blew
up today. The

01:08.435 --> 01:13.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spark came from a letter sent to
school districts
across the nation by the federal
government,

01:13.907 --> 01:18.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and it drew immediate
condemnation from conservative
states.

01:18.178 --> 01:24.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the nation's public schools,
the issue
was already simmering. After
today's federal

01:24.985 --> 01:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
directive, it's on the front
burner, that
is, provide transgender students
with access

01:30.757 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to suitable bathrooms and locker
rooms that
match their chosen gender
identity.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The challenge here is not to
isolate anybody.

01:39.066 --> 01:43.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not to discriminate against
anybody.
It's not to make anybody unsafe.
It's actually

01:43.270 --> 01:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ensure that our schools are
as inclusive
and respectful and safe as they
can possibly

01:50.043 --> 01:51.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

01:52.012 --> 01:55.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S.
Departments of Justice
and Education issued the
directive in a formal

01:56.049 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
letter to school districts. It
doesn't impose
new legal requirements.

02:01.188 --> 02:07.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, it cites Title IX's
existing protections
against sex discrimination that
are tied to

02:08.028 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal funding. According to
the directive:
"When a student or parent
notifies the school

02:14.001 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration that the student
will assert
a gender identity that differs
from previous

02:19.973 --> 02:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
records, the school will begin
treating the
student consistent with that
gender identity."

02:26.079 --> 02:31.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Attorney General Loretta
Lynch said the
goal is to protect against
harassment and

02:31.985 --> 02:35.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
address unjust policies in local
schools.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The transgender community
welcomed the news.

02:38.058 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX SINGH, Student: We have
someone who's
very powerful able to help us.

02:43.463 --> 02:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chicago student
Alex Singh
transitioned from female to male
two years

02:49.302 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ago. He appeared in a
"Frontline" documentary,
"Growing Up Trans," on PBS last
year.

02:55.542 --> 03:01.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX SINGH: When I first came
out, I was in
seventh grade, and before then,
going to the

03:01.148 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bathroom was kind of
uncomfortable for me,
as it would be for any guy going
into the

03:06.319 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
female restroom. It was very
uncomfortable,
very nerve-racking. I just felt
out of place

03:12.759 --> 03:14.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and like I didn't belong.

03:14.728 --> 03:20.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And high
schoolers in Arlington,
Virginia, offered their own
reactions today.

03:20.367 --> 03:25.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUMARI MARTIN, Student: Equal
rights is just
-- it's a part of our
government, our amendments.

03:25.672 --> 03:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, I don't think it should
be, like, based
on gender. If you're a U.S.
citizen, you should

03:30.877 --> 03:32.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be treated like one.

03:32.779 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CELINA CORDOVA, Student: I would
feel comfortable
going into the bathroom,
because, obviously,

03:36.817 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they think that they're female,
and I'm female,
so they wouldn't harm me.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the backlash
began almost
immediately.

03:42.422 --> 03:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK (R), Texas:
We will not
be blackmailed by the
president's 30 pieces

03:46.359 --> 03:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of silver. We will not sell out
our children
to the federal government.

03:48.728 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Texas,
Lieutenant Governor
Dan Patrick urged his state's
school superintendents

03:54.434 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
to defy the Obama
administration, even if
it means forfeiting billions in
federal aid.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK: He's
either paying back
the lesbian, gay and transgender
community

04:03.877 --> 04:11.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that helped him defeat Hillary
Clinton in
2008, or he believes in this
policy. I don't

04:12.018 --> 04:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know for what reason he's doing
it, but it
is the most damaging policy,
domestic policy

04:18.658 --> 04:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and that's saying something
for this president,
who gave us Obamacare -- the
most damaging

04:23.897 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
public policy he has put forth.

04:26.366 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Carolina
Govern Pat McCrory
takes a similar stance. His
state and the

04:31.938 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Department are already
suing each
other over a new state law
restricting public

04:38.178 --> 04:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bathroom use to a person's birth
gender.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R), North
Carolina: This
is an issue which is really
about privacy

04:43.550 --> 04:49.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vs. equality and that balance.
When you go
to a restroom or to a locker
room or to a

04:49.489 --> 04:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shower facility, there is an
expectation of
privacy, that the only other
people in that

04:54.795 --> 04:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room, in a very private moment,
I might add,
will be people of the same
gender.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY, Parent: She said, "Mom, I
think there's
a boy changing in my locker
room."

05:02.869 --> 05:08.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some parents are
worried as
well. This woman in Clovis,
California, where

05:08.275 --> 05:13.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools already follow a state
gender identity
law, expressed her concern this
week.

05:13.680 --> 05:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY: I understand that times
are changing
and that there are issues that
need to be

05:20.687 --> 05:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
addressed. I totally, completely
understand
that, but I don't think that
this is the right

05:26.960 --> 05:28.828 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
solution.

05:28.929 --> 05:32.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in another
development,
the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services

05:32.499 --> 05:39.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issued new rules today saying
transgender
people can't be denied health
care by professional

05:39.372 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
providers who receive federal
funding.

05:42.976 --> 05:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The transgender bathroom battle
also spilled
over into the presidential race
today. Republican

05:48.281 --> 05:53.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was asked about it
during phone-ins
to morning TV talk shows. He
said -- quote

05:54.087 --> 05:58.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- "Everybody has to be
protected," but he
argued it is not a federal
issue.

05:58.825 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I think the states should make
the decision.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're more capable of making
the decision.
I felt that from the beginning.
I just think

06:07.067 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it should be states' rights. I
think many,
many things actually should be
states' rights,

06:10.804 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but this is a perfect example of
it.

06:13.306 --> 06:17.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two
Democratic presidential
candidates, Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders,

06:17.644 --> 06:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had no immediate reaction.

06:19.412 --> 06:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will get a full airing of the
issue right
after the news summary.

06:23.450 --> 06:28.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer
has announced
that it will no longer allow its
drugs to

06:28.288 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be used in lethal injections.
With that decision
today, all federally approved
drug suppliers

06:34.461 --> 06:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have now blocked sales of their
products to
prison systems. A number of
states using the

06:39.366 --> 06:43.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death penalty have begun buying
the drugs
covertly.

06:43.870 --> 06:48.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
stepped up
his criticism of NATO missile
defense sites

06:48.842 --> 06:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Poland. Putin scoffed at U.S.
arguments
that the system is aimed at
Iranian missiles

06:54.881 --> 06:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not at Russia. He told
Russian military
officials -- quote -- "We will
have to think

06:59.719 --> 07:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how we can fend off the
threats.'

07:02.088 --> 07:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Polish and American
officials symbolically
broke ground for a new missile
interceptor

07:08.695 --> 07:11.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
site. Another site went
operational yesterday.

07:12.032 --> 07:18.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, Islamic State militants
attacked
for a third straight day. This
time, the target

07:18.338 --> 07:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the Shiite town of Balad,
about 50 miles
north of Baghdad. Two suicide
bombers and

07:24.577 --> 07:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gunmen stormed a busy coffee
shop there, killing
at least 13 people. Four more
were killed

07:30.917 --> 07:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a second attack later. ISIS
bombings earlier
this week killed nearly 100
civilians and

07:37.590 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soldiers.

07:39.492 --> 07:44.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Transportation Security
Administration
is appealing for patience as
travelers face

07:44.230 --> 07:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing security delays at
airports. Lines
have gotten longer in the face
of tighter

07:49.369 --> 07:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security procedures and fewer
transportation
security officers, or TSOs.

07:55.041 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Washington's Reagan National
Airport today,
the secretary of homeland
security, Jeh Johnson,

08:01.448 --> 08:03.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
promised corrective action.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security:
Our job is to keep the American
public safe.

08:06.086 --> 08:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're dealing this spring and
summer with
increased travel volume, which
obviously puts

08:11.358 --> 08:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an added burden on our TSOs and
increased
demand on the system. But we're
not going

08:16.963 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to compromise aviation security
in the face
of this.

08:20.433 --> 08:25.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congress agreed
this week to
inject more money into the TSA
to hire more

08:25.572 --> 08:31.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers and take other steps.
In the meantime,
officials are warning passengers
to arrive

08:31.311 --> 08:34.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least two hours ahead of
their flights.

08:34.581 --> 08:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A cyber-heist that stole $81
million from
a Bangladesh bank now appears to
be part of

08:41.087 --> 08:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wider campaign. The global
financial network
SWIFT reported today the same
hackers also

08:47.093 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit an unnamed Vietnamese bank.
And Europe's
largest weapons company, BAE
Systems, said

08:53.733 --> 09:01.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same malware is linked to
the cyber-attack
on Sony's Hollywood studio in
2014.

09:01.141 --> 09:06.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street's week ended with a
sell-off,
led by retail and bank stocks.
The Dow Jones

09:06.346 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average lost 185
points to close
at 17535. The Nasdaq fell 19
points, and the

09:15.021 --> 09:21.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
S&amp;P 500 slipped 17. For the
entire week, the
Dow was down 1 percent. The
Nasdaq and the

09:21.528 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
S&amp;P were off about
half-a-percent.

09:24.497 --> 09:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Lori J. Robinson made
history today,
taking over NORAD, the North
American Aerospace

09:30.437 --> 09:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense Command. A ceremony in
Colorado Springs
made her the first woman to head
a U.S. combat

09:37.844 --> 09:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
command. She's one of only two
female four-star
generals in the Air Force. She
is said to

09:43.683 --> 09:48.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a keen interest in space,
cyber-security
and drones.

09:48.922 --> 09:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the woman believed to be the
world's oldest
person, Susannah Mushatt Jones,
has died at

09:54.527 --> 10:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the age of 116. She passed away
Thursday at
a seniors home in Brooklyn, New
York. Jones

10:01.668 --> 10:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was born in Alabama in 1899, and
moved north
as a young woman. She never
drank or smoked,

10:08.541 --> 10:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but said she did eat bacon every
day. Susannah
Mushatt Jones was the last
living American

10:14.981 --> 10:18.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the 19th century.

10:18.318 --> 10:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
reaction
to the Obama administration's
sweeping directive

10:22.655 --> 10:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on public school bathrooms; a
key Hezbollah
leader killed in Syria; why some
see Alabama's

10:29.929 --> 10:42.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overcrowded prisons as a sign of
racial injustice;
and much more.

10:42.909 --> 10:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The battle over the use of
school facilities
by transgender students has
already flared

10:50.083 --> 10:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in North Carolina and in
other communities,
including in Southeastern
Virginia and a Chicago

10:56.556 --> 10:58.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suburb.

10:58.525 --> 11:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the directive to all U.S.
public schools
from the Obama administration
spreads it across

11:02.996 --> 11:04.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nation.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan is in our New
York studios
tonight, and has more on the
reaction and

11:08.801 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible impact.

11:10.703 --> 11:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm joined by
two people
who have been involved on both
sides of this

11:14.774 --> 11:16.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alex Myers is an English teacher
at Phillips
Exeter Academy, a private school
in New Hampshire.

11:20.079 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also an author and speaks
frequently
about gender identity. He's
transgender, came

11:25.552 --> 11:29.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in high school and was the
first openly
transgender student to attend
Harvard. And

11:29.689 --> 11:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeremy Tedesco is senior legal
counsel with
Alliance Defending Freedom, a
faith-based

11:35.128 --> 11:40.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
legal advocacy group. It
represents several
groups of parents that oppose
allowing students

11:40.300 --> 11:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to use school bathrooms based on
gender identity.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alex, let me start with you.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is this so significant to
you?

11:46.706 --> 11:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX MYERS, Teacher, Phillips
Exeter Academy:
This is really a moment of
recognition that

11:50.410 --> 11:52.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is unparalleled.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the transgender
community has been
existing at the margins not only
of mainstream

11:55.982 --> 12:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
society, but also in some ways
of the LGBT
community. And President Obama's
and Loretta

12:01.521 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynch's statement earlier this
week really
bring us out of the shadows and
into the mainstream.

12:05.758 --> 12:10.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeremy
Tedesco, your organization
is involved in two different
lawsuits in Chicago

12:10.697 --> 12:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in North Carolina to try to
prevent these
types of policies from rolling
out.

12:15.501 --> 12:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there a lot of students not
transgender
who are trying to go into the
other bathrooms,

12:20.673 --> 12:23.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so to speak? I mean, why is this
a step too
far?

12:23.309 --> 12:26.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEREMY TEDESCO, Alliance
Defending Freedom:
Well, I really appreciate you
having us on.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm glad we can be on PBS
and have a civil
discourse about this whole
issue.

12:30.883 --> 12:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, ADF, Alliance
Defending Freedom,
where I work, has been pushing
out policies

12:34.654 --> 12:40.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to school districts for several
years now,
policies that are promote a
compassionate

12:40.226 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alternative that meets the needs
of every
student at the school.

12:44.564 --> 12:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, our policy says students who
for whatever
reason are uncomfortable using
the locker

12:49.302 --> 12:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room or shower or restroom
designated for
their biological sex should be
given alternative

12:55.875 --> 12:59.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
facilities, single-stall
facilities or whatever
is available at the school.
Almost all schools

12:59.278 --> 13:01.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have those available.

13:01.214 --> 13:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they shouldn't allow the
privacy rights
of other students to be violated
in providing

13:05.718 --> 13:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those accommodations. There's
interests, rights
on both sides of the equation in
the bathroom

13:12.158 --> 13:17.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and locker room contexts.
Students have an
expectation of privacy in those
facilities.

13:18.031 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Obama administration is
completely
trampling those rights by
directing schools

13:22.835 --> 13:27.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to just let students of one sex
into the locker
rooms and restrooms of students
of the other

13:28.074 --> 13:29.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sex.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alex, how is a
school supposed
to strike this balance to try to
protect the

13:33.079 --> 13:36.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
privacy of all students, as
Jeremy says, not
just the transgender ones?

13:36.582 --> 13:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX MYERS: Well, I first think
that the basic
thing a school needs to do is
educate and

13:41.821 --> 13:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
train faculty, administration
and students,
just so people are aware.

13:45.758 --> 13:50.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of the problems
are actually
caused by ignorance, rather than
actual incidents.

13:50.296 --> 13:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in terms of privacy and in
terms of what
was just outlined, I think that
the problem

13:54.200 --> 13:59.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with having a separate
single-gender, single-use
bathroom is that you're really
mandating that

13:59.539 --> 14:04.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that sounds like
separate but equal,
when we want is for people to
coexist together,

14:04.811 --> 14:07.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for there not to be segregation
of any kind.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of privacy rights, I
think you might
be looking at modifying
particularly locker

14:11.984 --> 14:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room facilities to allow every
student, cisgender
and transgender, for more
privacy. And I think

14:17.457 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that what you will find largely
is that transgender
want to go into restrooms, want
to go into

14:21.861 --> 14:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locker rooms, they want to use
those facilities,
they want to use discreetly, and
they value

14:26.232 --> 14:28.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their own privacy.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are not likely to
intrude on others.
I would also add that I find I
rather ironic

14:31.604 --> 14:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, at this point in time, the
conservative
movement is mentioning privacy
as a right,

14:35.141 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when, for so many years, they
enacted and
enforced sodomy laws, which had
no respect

14:39.011 --> 14:40.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for people's privacy.

14:40.980 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeremy, in the
joint letter
today from the DOJ and the
Department of Education,

14:45.118 --> 14:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were examples of school
districts from
Alaska to Kansas City to
Massachusetts that

14:50.957 --> 14:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all have created policies in
figuring a way
through this without any
lawsuits.

14:57.063 --> 15:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why aren't these fixes good
enough? Sometimes,
it was as simple as a stall with
a door or

15:02.001 --> 15:03.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a curtain.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY TEDESCO: Well, if you put
a stall -- for
instance, the Illinois lawsuit,
where we filed

15:06.939 --> 15:11.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the lawsuit against the
Department of Education
and a school district outside of
Chicago,

15:11.310 --> 15:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they did install a few privacy
stalls inside
the girls locker room, but that
doesn't solve

15:15.615 --> 15:18.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything, because those stalls
are inside
the locker room.

15:18.651 --> 15:23.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the biologically male
student has to walk
through the locker room while
girls are changing

15:23.189 --> 15:28.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for P.E. class. They are in a
state of undress.
That happens every day of the
year, every

15:28.761 --> 15:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year of school, because P.E. is
a mandatory
class at that school.

15:32.365 --> 15:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So these girls have to suffer
the humiliation,
the degradation, the affront to
their dignity

15:37.470 --> 15:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the privacy violations on an
everyday
basis in the school. It doesn't
solve the

15:42.809 --> 15:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem. See, privacy rights say
that a person
of the opposite sex, they stop
at the door

15:48.514 --> 15:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the locker room, not at some
door to some
private stall inside the locker
room.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bar is at the door to the
locker room.
And that's -- just that's
consistent with

15:57.356 --> 16:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the expectation of privacy that
we have always
had in our society when it comes
to the use

16:01.828 --> 16:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these kinds of facilities.
And, again,
that right is protected by the
U.S. Constitution.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so what the Obama
administration is promoting
is something that tramples the
privacy rights

16:11.938 --> 16:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the dignity of girls at
schools across
the country and boys. You know,
in Illinois,

16:17.543 --> 16:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have 63 student plaintiffs,
130-plus plaintiffs
altogether. These people, you
know, they're

16:23.416 --> 16:25.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
religious, they're not
religious.

16:25.251 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, privacy is something
that cuts across
religious and ideological lines,
and these

16:29.188 --> 16:32.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people just want their
children's right to
privacy protected by their
schools and by

16:32.191 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the federal government.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alex, what do
you say to
those parents who are in this
lawsuit?

16:36.395 --> 16:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX MYERS: I think that the
time has come
to be a little bit more educated
and a little

16:42.168 --> 16:43.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bit more open.

16:44.070 --> 16:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really have not heard of any
incidents of
harassment or assault. I'm not
aware of there

16:48.307 --> 16:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being any legitimate problems
that have been
voiced by cisgender students.
And, again,

16:52.879 --> 16:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the majority, the
vast majority,
the overwhelming majority of
transgender people

16:57.149 --> 17:00.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who use public facilities want
to do so with
respect to their own privacy and
their own

17:00.920 --> 17:02.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discretion.

17:02.855 --> 17:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It simply has not risen to any
attention that
I know of that there's been any
problem with

17:07.493 --> 17:09.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the use there.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeremy
Tedesco, on your
site, there -- you also seem to
be drawing

17:11.731 --> 17:18.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
almost an inference that
allowing transgender
people these rights is the
equivalent to shielding

17:18.137 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sexual predators.

17:20.106 --> 17:23.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The examples that you cite on
the blog repeatedly
seem like either people who are
political

17:23.309 --> 17:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activists or perhaps sexual
predators. Are
you trying to equate the two
groups?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEREMY TEDESCO: Well, of course
not.

17:30.449 --> 17:35.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we don't think that
providing access to
people who are truly struggling
with gender

17:35.454 --> 17:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identity issues is going to be a
safety problem.
The problem is that these laws
allow people

17:40.760 --> 17:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to simply self-identify as the
opposite sex
and gain access.

17:45.598 --> 17:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't tell me, based on all
the evidence
that's out there, that people
who have, you

17:51.470 --> 17:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, unconscionable purposes,
that want to,
you know, take advantage of
these kind of

17:55.107 --> 17:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policies, use them as a ruse to
gain access
will not do so.

17:58.144 --> 18:03.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, look, there is a
criminal element
out there that will do that. We
need to recognize

18:03.182 --> 18:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, as a culture, but we also
need to recognize
the privacy problems. You know,
the idea that

18:08.020 --> 18:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there hasn't been any kind of
report of some
kind of safety problem in a
particular situation

18:12.858 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or a particular school really
doesn't respond
to the problem.

18:15.695 --> 18:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is the privacy
violation, the
incredible amount of
uncomfortability, humiliation,

18:21.300 --> 18:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degradation and embarrassment
that our clients
in Illinois, for instance, the
girls in the

18:25.705 --> 18:28.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
locker room, experience on a
daily basis.

18:28.474 --> 18:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the girls in our lawsuit
aren't using
the restroom very much at
school. They're

18:32.311 --> 18:36.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
holding it all day long. We have
another girl
who wears her gym clothes under
her regular

18:36.882 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clothes, so she doesn't have to
undress in
the locker room.

18:39.785 --> 18:44.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then she has to wear soiled,
dirty gym
clothes the rest of the day just
so she can

18:45.024 --> 18:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to preserve her privacy and
her dignity
in the locker room. We shouldn't
be doing

18:48.794 --> 18:50.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that as a culture.

18:50.696 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alex Myers,
there is not
necessarily a card that you get
when you're

18:54.333 --> 18:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transgender. How do you get over
that sort
of identification problem, when
a transgender

18:58.671 --> 19:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual or any individual
wants to identify
and go into an opposite locker
room? What's

19:03.009 --> 19:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be the simple rule that
works at
the parks and recreation
department or high

19:07.780 --> 19:09.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX MYERS: I think that you
find most transgender
people use the bathroom that
they feel matches

19:13.052 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their gender identity and that
they can pass
in, so that the one that they're
going to

19:16.922 --> 19:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walk into and not be kicked out
of, the one
that they're going to walk into
and not cause

19:20.426 --> 19:22.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an incident.

19:22.228 --> 19:25.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It really takes special
circumstances for
a transgender person to walk
into a space

19:25.464 --> 19:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they know they are going
to be rejected.
That's when the fear of
harassment and abuse,

19:29.068 --> 19:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in my mind, comes to light.

19:31.037 --> 19:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would simply say that
there simply hasn't
been a case of any abuse or
harassment or

19:35.441 --> 19:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any problem of a person being a
predator in
these spaces posing as a
transgender person.

19:41.881 --> 19:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Transgender people have been
using public
facilities that match their
gender identity

19:45.251 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for years and years, and that
simply hasn't
happened yet.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeremy
Tedesco, finally,
I want to ask you. There are
going to be people

19:51.657 --> 19:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watching this interview thinking
to themselves
almost everything that the
plaintiffs in these

19:56.128 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases that he's representing, if
you just
substituted the word transgender
with race,

20:01.600 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this sounds like what people
said 50 years
ago.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEREMY TEDESCO: Well, there is
simply no comparison.

20:06.939 --> 20:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, here's the thing. Title
IX, which
is at the source of all of this,
which, by

20:11.610 --> 20:15.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the way, oh, the Obama
administration is radically
reinterpreting and just ignoring
Congress'

20:15.714 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will by forcing its political
agenda on the
country, Title IX, for over 40
years, has

20:21.087 --> 20:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that schools can comply
with Title IX
by having separate facilities,
locker rooms,

20:28.194 --> 20:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restrooms and showers for girls
and for boys.

20:30.830 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not the equivalent of
race discrimination,
and the suggestion that it is,
is just a tactic

20:36.001 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to get people to shut up
and not express
their opinions about this kind
of a topic.

20:40.473 --> 20:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not the same thing. It's
been recognized
under the law for 40-plus years.
It's a entirely

20:45.144 --> 20:49.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rationale and reasonable
division between
the sexes in those kinds of
facilities.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Jeremy Tedesco,
Alex Myers, thank you both.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALEX MYERS: Thank you.

20:55.754 --> 20:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEREMY TEDESCO: Thank you.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks to you
all.

20:58.657 --> 21:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is much more online,
including our
report this week on how the U.S.
military

21:03.362 --> 21:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is working on its new rules for
transgender
service members. That's on our
home page.

21:08.234 --> 21:13.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus, you can watch
"Frontline"'s full documentary,
"Growing Up Trans." That is
streaming now

21:13.772 --> 21:28.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at PBS.org/Frontline.

21:28.687 --> 21:33.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Word came today that the man
believed to be
the top military commander of
Hezbollah was

21:33.459 --> 21:39.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
killed in Syria. The
Iranian-backed group
has fought against the U.S. and
Israel since

21:39.198 --> 21:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was founded in the early
1980s. And it
has joined forces with the Assad
regime in

21:45.070 --> 21:46.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Syrian war.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Jane Ferguson
has our report.

21:49.975 --> 21:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: People in this
suburb of Beirut
have been to many funerals since
the beginning

21:55.347 --> 22:00.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the war in Syria, but none as
big as this.

22:01.086 --> 22:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mustafa Badreddine was believed
to be the
main military commander of
Hezbollah forces

22:06.492 --> 22:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting in Syria. In life, he
was a villain
to America and its allies. In
death, he is

22:12.464 --> 22:16.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a hero to these people.

22:16.368 --> 22:21.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Hezbollah neighborhoods of
Beirut, the
funerals of war dead feel like
celebrations.

22:21.473 --> 22:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Women throw rice and rose petals
on the coffin
as it passes.

22:25.311 --> 22:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I know there are martyrs in
Syria," this
woman says, "but we like that
and we are happy

22:31.283 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we give martyrdom. If we
didn't go
to Syria, ISIS would come to
here."

22:36.055 --> 22:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: When the name of this dead
man is in
our minds, we will always
remember that we

22:45.798 --> 22:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to fight. We have to get
revenge from
those who killed him.

22:49.268 --> 22:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Badreddine was
believed to
have been involved in the
devastating attack

22:53.339 --> 23:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the U.S. Marine barracks in
Beirut in 1983,
which killed 241 Americans. He
was also indicted

23:01.313 --> 23:07.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the assassination of
Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri in a huge truck
bomb in 2005.

23:07.987 --> 23:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was killed in Syria leading
Hezbollah's
military campaign, propping up
the group's

23:12.625 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ally President Bashar al-Assad.
Young men
from here often go to fight in
Syria for Hezbollah,

23:19.398 --> 23:24.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many returning in coffins. It's
a heavy price
the group is paying for its
involvement in

23:24.670 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the war.

23:26.672 --> 23:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death of this commander,
however, is the
biggest loss to the group since
his predecessor

23:31.243 --> 23:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was killed in 2008. Mustafa
Badreddine, according
to Hezbollah, had said just a
few months ago

23:36.081 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he would only return to
Lebanon from
Syria either victorious or as a
martyr.

23:43.656 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Professor Daniel Byman of
Georgetown University
says he was a founding member of
Hezbollah.

23:48.527 --> 23:52.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL BYMAN, Georgetown
University: Badreddine's
death is a big blow to
Hezbollah. He's someone

23:52.731 --> 23:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was there at the founding of
the movement.
He's been with it in leadership
positions,

23:58.304 --> 24:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really the tip of the sphere
almost everywhere
they have been active, whether
it's been in

24:01.573 --> 24:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kuwait, in Lebanon, now in
Syria.

24:05.010 --> 24:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a tremendous blow.
It has repeatedly
lost senior leaders in its
history, and it

24:10.416 --> 24:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has repeatedly emerged strong
and committed.
So, it's not likely to change
things in the

24:15.354 --> 24:17.222 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

24:17.323 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: It's not clear
who was responsible
for his death. Badreddine would
have been

24:20.626 --> 24:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a target for both Israel and
extremist groups
fighting in Syria, like ISIS.

24:26.398 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hezbollah leaders say Badreddine
was killed
in a huge explosion in Damascus
and that they're

24:31.603 --> 24:36.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigating who was behind the
attack. They
expect to make an announcement
in the coming

24:36.942 --> 24:38.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

24:38.110 --> 24:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Beirut.

24:45.217 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:54.827 --> 24:59.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and Michael Gerson analyze the
week's news;

24:59.531 --> 25:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how advances in genetic
sequencing is
saving lives.

25:03.902 --> 25:09.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, the latest
installment in our
series Broken Justice about new
approaches

25:09.575 --> 25:11.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to criminal justice.

25:11.510 --> 25:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we have a conversation
with a noted
lawyer and author on questions
of sentencing,

25:17.049 --> 25:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overcrowding in prisons and
whether a series
of changes around the country go
far enough.

25:21.854 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown traveled to
Alabama for our
report.

25:25.324 --> 25:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Equal Justice
Initiative
in Montgomery, Alabama, a
nonprofit founded

25:31.997 --> 25:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 1989 by lawyer and civil
rights activist
Bryan Stevenson to represent
death row prisoners

25:38.570 --> 25:44.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and indigent and juvenile
defendants who he
argues have been denied
effective representation,

25:44.643 --> 25:46.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
often due to racial bias.

25:46.912 --> 25:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In recent years, which included
the publication
of an acclaimed memoir, "Just
Mercy," Stevenson

25:52.618 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has become a leading voice
nationally for
criminal justice reform.

25:56.622 --> 26:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I met him at his office in
Montgomery while
reporting on Alabama's
overcrowded prisons

26:02.494 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and spike in prison violence.

26:04.596 --> 26:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON, Founder, Equal
Justice Initiative:
There were less than 5,000
people in Alabama's

26:07.232 --> 26:10.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prisons throughout most of the
1970s.

26:10.369 --> 26:16.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you had politicians
like you had
all over the country get
captivated, I'm going

26:16.241 --> 26:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say intoxicated, by the
politics of fear.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Intoxicated.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Yes,
intoxicated by the politics
of fear and anger. They began
competing with

26:24.249 --> 26:28.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other over who could be the
toughest
on crime, and putting people in
prison became

26:28.954 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the solution to virtually every
problem.

26:31.356 --> 26:35.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Drug addiction and drug
dependency, which
could have been seen as a health
issue, was

26:35.260 --> 26:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen as a crime issue. The
growing freedom
that was emerging in the Deep
South for African-Americans,

26:40.699 --> 26:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who until just a decade earlier
couldn't vote,
couldn't go into schools, had to
be regulated.

26:45.804 --> 26:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we used the criminal justice
system, and
you saw this massive increase in
the number

26:50.509 --> 26:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people sent to jails or
prisons.

26:52.411 --> 26:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we went from about 5,000
people in the
1970s to 30,000 people today in
a state with

26:58.951 --> 27:03.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 4.5 million people. That's
an unbelievably
high rate of incarceration.

27:03.755 --> 27:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're seeing
this -- you're
seeing our incarceration system
as a continuation

27:08.560 --> 27:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of slavery, of a history of
racial injustice
in the country.

27:12.197 --> 27:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Well, I think
it's a continuation
of using crime narrative to
control social

27:17.369 --> 27:21.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and political dynamics that
can't be controlled
in more legitimate ways.

27:22.074 --> 27:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we created this so-called
war on drugs,
and we targeted people of color,
and we got

27:26.245 --> 27:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody to buy into the fact
that if we
don't put these dangerous people
into jails

27:30.249 --> 27:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and prisons, we are none safe.
And that's
how we went nationwide from a
prison population

27:35.153 --> 27:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of about 300,000 in the 1970s to
2.3 million
today. And now we have the
highest rate of

27:41.660 --> 27:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incarceration in the world.

27:43.462 --> 27:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And here in
Alabama, an extreme
model of it.

27:47.699 --> 27:49.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Exactly.

27:49.601 --> 27:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's rooted in this comfort
level with
reducing people to their worst
act and acting

27:54.273 --> 28:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in very extreme, harsh, punitive
ways. I mean,
a state that was shaped by
lynching as a response

28:00.846 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to things like interracial sex,
or organizing
for better sharecropping
conditions, to use

28:09.288 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lynching, calling these people
criminals,
has created a culture, an
environment where

28:15.794 --> 28:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then putting people in prison
for life with
no chance of parole for writing
a bad check

28:20.666 --> 28:23.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or being in possession of
marijuana didn't
seem so radical.

28:23.602 --> 28:28.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Last year,
Alabama's Republican
legislature and governor passed
a law to reform

28:28.907 --> 28:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of Alabama's sentencing
guidelines and
increase probation and parole
supervision.

28:34.446 --> 28:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stevenson believes such measures
here and
elsewhere don't go nearly far
enough.

28:39.217 --> 28:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: I think people
realize that
we're spending way too much
money on jails

28:46.191 --> 28:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and prisons. And I think that's
true in Alabama.
It's true nationwide. We went
from $6 billion

28:51.330 --> 28:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent on jails and prisons in
the United States
in 1980 to $80 billion last
year.

28:55.867 --> 29:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the recession was terrible
for everybody,
for everything, except criminal
justice reform,

29:00.205 --> 29:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, all of a sudden, state
legislators
had to start asking harder
questions about

29:04.176 --> 29:08.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why we're spending so much money
to keep people
in jails or prison who are not a
threat to

29:08.747 --> 29:10.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public safety.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you think
it's more a concern
out of money than anything else
that is leading

29:14.019 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to whatever discussion there is
about changes?

29:16.688 --> 29:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Well, I think
that's the
primary motivation. I do.

29:19.625 --> 29:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we were a more affluent
today, if we had
more resources, I don't think
we'd have the

29:23.462 --> 29:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same interest. Too many people
in this state,
too many people in this country
don't care

29:30.168 --> 29:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if people who are in jails or
prisons are
abused. They don't care if
they're raped.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't care if they are
murdered. They
don't care if they're assaulted.
They don't

29:38.610 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care about their victimization.

29:40.445 --> 29:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, because of that, we haven't
responded
the way a just society, a decent
society is

29:46.251 --> 29:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supposed to respond when you see
abuse and
murder and rape and misconduct.

29:51.690 --> 29:56.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, if you had
your opportunity,
given where things are at right
now, what

29:56.962 --> 29:59.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the one -- what's the most
important thing
that needs to happen?

29:59.998 --> 30:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Can I do two?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

30:03.201 --> 30:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: I will -- the
two things
that I would do, I would commit
to reducing

30:08.240 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the prison population by 5,000
people. Just
put out an arbitrary number like
that.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Where do those
people go?

30:14.646 --> 30:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: They will go
home. We have
5,000 people in our jails and
prisons that

30:19.518 --> 30:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could go home tomorrow that
wouldn't in any
way threaten public safety.

30:24.923 --> 30:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you know who could help us
identify those
5,000 are the wardens at these
prisons. If

30:29.327 --> 30:34.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you said to any warden in the
state of Alabama,
can you identify 50, 100, 200
people in your

30:34.599 --> 30:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prison who you think could go
home tomorrow,
wouldn't be a problem, most of
them could

30:38.437 --> 30:40.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do it in a heartbeat.

30:40.172 --> 30:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could get to that 5,000
number just like
that. And then we could take the
money we

30:46.178 --> 30:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
save, the significant money that
we save,
and invest in better caregiving,
better management.

30:53.552 --> 30:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to have people running
prisons that
care about the incarcerated,
that are smart,

30:59.958 --> 31:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that aren't bullies, that aren't
reactionary,
that aren't kind of vindictive.
And then you

31:09.067 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could begin to see improved
conditions.

31:10.902 --> 31:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you more
optimistic nationally,
when you look at the large
picture?

31:14.506 --> 31:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: I'm cautiously
optimistic.

31:17.676 --> 31:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But punishment is a local issue.
And the national
discourse will only have an
impact on places

31:23.982 --> 31:29.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like Alabama if people in
Alabama step up.
But I am generally hopeful. I
don't think

31:29.588 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's going to happen by itself,
and what I'm
worried about is that Congress
might pass

31:33.959 --> 31:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few reforms, we might see
reforms here and
there, and we're going to
declare victory,

31:39.664 --> 31:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and three years from now, the
prison population
will have decreased by 1
percent, and we will

31:43.668 --> 31:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still be the most punitive
nation on the planet.

31:46.071 --> 31:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Stevenson now has
a broader
educational project under way,
erecting markers

31:51.443 --> 31:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to remind people of a history
often ignored,
and his group is collecting
samples of earth

31:56.515 --> 32:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the sites of lynchings,
with an aim toward
creating memorials around the
state.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I asked Stevenson what drives
him.

32:04.089 --> 32:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STEVENSON: Well, I think,
when you see
what I see, you don't have a
choice. I think,

32:08.760 --> 32:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if most people saw what I see,
they'd have
the same instinct, they'd have
the same idea,

32:14.166 --> 32:17.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we have to fix this,
because it's unconscionable.

32:17.202 --> 32:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have kids, 15- and 16-year-
old kids, that
we're still putting in adult
jails and prisons

32:22.474 --> 32:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Alabama. And what happens to
those children
is that they get abused, they
get assaulted.

32:26.778 --> 32:31.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that there's a
decent person
watching this program that, if
they saw that,

32:31.316 --> 32:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't feel like, we have got
to stop that.

32:33.752 --> 32:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Montgomery, Alabama, I'm
Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS NewsHour."

32:44.129 --> 32:56.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn to a
week in Republican
politics that saw the
presumptive presidential

32:56.341 --> 33:02.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee confront a divided
party, and one
in Democratic politics that saw
the underdog

33:02.314 --> 33:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidate notch another primary
victory.

33:05.717 --> 33:10.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We analysis it all with Shields
and Gerson.
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields

33:10.422 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Washington Post columnist
Michael Gerson.
David Brooks is away tonight.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

33:16.661 --> 33:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start, Mark, with our
lead story
tonight, the administration,
Obama administration,

33:20.932 --> 33:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting out a directive to
public schools
all over the country to make
bathroom, locker

33:26.438 --> 33:32.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room facilities available to
transgender students.
What effect do you see this
having?

33:32.110 --> 33:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: In the real world
in education,
I'm not sure, Judy.

33:36.648 --> 33:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politically, prior to today, the
politics
were all on the side of those
who had opposed

33:44.089 --> 33:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the North Carolina law, which
basically restricted
and came up with -- was sort of
a bogus boogeyman,

33:56.601 --> 34:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I guess is redundant, that
there were
all these men putting on women's
clothes and

34:03.475 --> 34:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going into restrooms to molest
females.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it just -- but they
passed...

34:08.346 --> 34:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes, solving a
problem that
didn't exist.

34:09.848 --> 34:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly. Exactly.

34:10.448 --> 34:11.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:11.483 --> 34:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was their
allegation.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I really felt
that way.
And I think that obviously the
business community

34:17.022 --> 34:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reacted as one and cost North
Carolina great
amounts of PayPal jobs, Deutsche
Bank, Google,

34:25.897 --> 34:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coca-Cola. A Bruce Springsteen
concert was
canceled.

34:29.601 --> 34:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there was a defensiveness.
Now, today,
this -- today's movement by the
president

34:37.075 --> 34:42.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strikes me that the silence on
the part of
Democrats, of Secretary
Clinton's campaign,

34:42.747 --> 34:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Bernie Sanders' campaign, of
other Democrats
in leadership positions, I have
yet to hear

34:48.687 --> 34:51.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senators from the Hill or
governors.

34:51.656 --> 34:59.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm not sure. The federal
atom bomb of
federal spending, talking $3
billion in the

34:59.497 --> 35:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state of North Carolina, is an
enormous, enormous
weapon. But I'm not -- the lack
of enthusiastic

35:06.638 --> 35:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response from Secretary Clinton
and Senator
Sanders, I'm not sure that they
see it as

35:11.443 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an unmixed political blessing.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least at this
point, we
don't know that they have
commented yet. We

35:15.947 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
haven't heard of any comment.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They didn't rush
to the microphones.
Put it that way.

35:18.717 --> 35:19.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good way of
putting it.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael, how do you read the
political repercussions
from this?

35:24.322 --> 35:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: You know, I
don't know.

35:26.257 --> 35:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the kind of issue that
is normally
handled with culture norms, and
people making

35:31.830 --> 35:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compromises, and, you know,
meeting real needs,
because there is one here.
People should be

35:37.469 --> 35:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treated the way they want to be
treated. That's
a basic norm.

35:41.206 --> 35:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now we have both sides
politicizing this,
raising it to the highest levels
of stakes,

35:47.579 --> 35:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely to go in the courts, way
up in the
courts, resentment, conflict.
It's turned

35:54.586 --> 35:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a culture war controversy.
And we take
issues like this that maybe
people of good

35:59.891 --> 36:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will could to some agreement on,
and run them
through this culture war machine
of our politics,

36:08.033 --> 36:13.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then there has to be a
winner and a loser,
when, in fact, I think, on this
type of issue,

36:13.204 --> 36:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a long history of maybe
reasonable
people reaching accommodations
in their own

36:18.243 --> 36:20.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

36:20.145 --> 36:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
that's what
the White House has done by
coming out with

36:21.046 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this directive today, stirring
it up?

36:22.881 --> 36:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think it's an
overreach,
but I think the other side
overreached in

36:25.417 --> 36:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Carolina as well, and by
politicizing
this.

36:28.153 --> 36:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn now to
the story
I guess that had everybody
consumed, Mark,

36:32.690 --> 36:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week in Washington, Donald
Trump.

36:35.060 --> 36:40.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that it looks like he has
wrapped up the
nomination, there is this dance,
this effort

36:40.732 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
under way to win over
Republicans, especially
Republicans here in Washington
who still have

36:46.905 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not climbed on board, have not
endorsed him.

36:49.774 --> 36:54.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What did that look like to you?
There were
meetings. There were -- behind
closed doors.

36:54.746 --> 36:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of these Republicans have
come over and
said they will support him, but
others are

36:59.317 --> 37:00.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
holding back.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Judy.

37:02.053 --> 37:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan being
the most visible,
I mean, a man who's earned his
credibility

37:06.224 --> 37:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his reputation of being a
man of conviction
on issues like welfare, of
immigration reform,

37:16.634 --> 37:24.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of balancing the budget, of open
and free
trade, of controlling
entitlement spending

37:24.776 --> 37:30.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and limiting and privatizing
Medicare, met
with Donald Trump, who has run
against all

37:30.281 --> 37:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four, emphatically and loudly
against all
four, and said he was a nice
man.

37:35.520 --> 37:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's basically become the
default position
for Republicans who really don't
like Donald

37:39.858 --> 37:44.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump very much. Is he a nice
man? Lindsey
Graham is discovering in him
qualities of

37:44.329 --> 37:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warmth that had gone undetected
in their fight
during the primaries.

37:47.732 --> 37:49.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:49.634 --> 37:53.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I think Paul
Ryan reflects
-- he's trying to provide some
cover to his

37:53.104 --> 37:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own suburban Republicans that
might be threatened
by a Donald Trump candidacy in
suburban districts,

37:58.276 --> 38:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there's a question of
Trump being a
liability to Republicans.

38:02.747 --> 38:09.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, at the same time, he
understands that
you're far better off having a
united party.

38:09.521 --> 38:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what has helped Donald
Trump, more
than anything else, is that the
first poll

38:13.791 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that came out, the CNN poll
showing Hillary
Clinton with a 13-point lead,
54-41, and then

38:19.898 --> 38:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every poll since then has shown
the race a
lot closer, especially in
battleground states

38:25.036 --> 38:28.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Ohio and Florida and
Pennsylvania even.

38:28.273 --> 38:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, perhaps associating with him
is not the
political threat or liability
that it might

38:34.846 --> 38:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been. And I think you will
see people
nudging over.

38:37.549 --> 38:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how do you --
what is the
thought process going on here,
Michael, on

38:41.019 --> 38:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the part of some of the members
of Congress
especially who were just
unalterably opposed

38:45.456 --> 38:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to him, were supporting others,
and now they
are moving over to his side?

38:48.927 --> 38:50.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes. Yes.

38:50.762 --> 38:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think ®MDNM-Ryan has laid the
predicate
for eventual surrender. I think
the normal

38:55.867 --> 39:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaction here is to try to rally
the party,
to pick the lesser of two evils,
to find whatever

39:01.906 --> 39:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreement you can and emphasize
it.

39:04.375 --> 39:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, this isn't a
normal circumstance.
You're not dealing with a man
that has some

39:09.080 --> 39:13.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different policy views, even on
big issues.
You're dealing with a man that's
not qualified

39:13.351 --> 39:19.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the presidency, not
qualified morally
because he picks on minority
groups, not qualified

39:19.824 --> 39:21.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
temperamentally.

39:21.659 --> 39:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have seen what a president
looks like. It
doesn't look like this. And not
qualified

39:26.064 --> 39:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from background and experience,
and so I think
a lot of the political class is
dealing with

39:31.336 --> 39:37.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this as one of the normal issues
of compromise,
instead of looking at this, is
he fit to be

39:37.108 --> 39:39.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president of the United States?
That's a question
they want to avoid.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what is the
-- what is
that -- again, I'm trying to get
at what the

39:43.381 --> 39:44.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thought process is, Mark.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:46.684 --> 39:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How is it that
some members
are finding him acceptable and
others are

39:49.721 --> 39:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still -- are holding out? And
Paul Ryan is
holding out, but the sense is
that he is going

39:53.725 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to come around.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The question at
the office pool
is, will Bernie Sanders endorse
Hillary Clinton

39:57.729 --> 40:01.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before Paul Ryan endorses Donald
Trump?

40:01.599 --> 40:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think there's any
question, after
the post-session, that Paul Ryan
is heading

40:07.338 --> 40:12.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that direction. Judy, if
you're running
for reelection, it's always
easier to run

40:12.310 --> 40:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the same ticket with your
presidential
candidate lined up, because, for
your own

40:18.583 --> 40:22.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survival, if you break with the
presidential
candidate, that presidential
candidate has

40:22.520 --> 40:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some loyal supporters who may
exact retribution
on you, even though you're
running for the

40:27.725 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House or the Senate, that you
turned your
back on our guy and punish you.

40:33.398 --> 40:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's easier to do that. But,
you know,
I have to say, I think, in the
case of Lindsey

40:40.805 --> 40:46.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Graham -- this is projection on
my part -- why
he's going soft on Donald Trump
or sounding

40:46.544 --> 40:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
softer, is that his best friend
in the world,
John McCain, is up for
reelection and in a

40:52.350 --> 40:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very difficult race in Arizona.
And Donald
Trump could be a liability
there. And he just

40:57.221 --> 41:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feels that, somehow, if he goes
easy, that
this will be less of a problem
for John McCain.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

41:04.629 --> 41:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do have to say, we knew
this would happen.
When you get the nomination,
controlling the

41:08.399 --> 41:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party is powerful. But when you
see it in
reality, it's kind of revolting.

41:13.771 --> 41:18.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somebody like Rick Perry, who
was the leading
critic of Donald Trump's
character early...

41:18.242 --> 41:18.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:18.810 --> 41:20.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: ... talked about
him as a
cancer on conservatism, now
angling for a

41:23.247 --> 41:24.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vice presidential nod.

41:25.083 --> 41:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see some -- a serious person
like Senator
Corker, who seems to have
ambitions in that

41:30.555 --> 41:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration. It's a sad
thing, in many
ways, to watch what happens when
political

41:35.927 --> 41:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reality takes hold in these
cases.

41:38.062 --> 41:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you -- how
do Republicans
reconcile what appear to be
changing stances

41:45.636 --> 41:51.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on positions, on raising taxes
one day, saying,
no, I'm not raising taxes on the
wealthy the

41:51.743 --> 41:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next day, different statements
on whether
the wall is going to be built
and how high

41:55.913 --> 41:57.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's going to be?

41:57.115 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

41:58.883 --> 42:05.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, there's two things to bear
in mind.
Donald Trump has no public
record, OK? So,

42:05.723 --> 42:10.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he doesn't have policies. He's
never had policies,
never been a policy candidate.
He's disdained

42:10.962 --> 42:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white papers or think tanks or
anything of
the sort. He's been a campaign
of bumper stickers.

42:17.034 --> 42:23.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Build a wall. Make Mexico pay
for it. Take
it back. Send them back. Round
them all up.

42:23.107 --> 42:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's it. So, as a consequence,
he has no
-- he has a very tenuous
connection with the

42:30.915 --> 42:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
positions he's taken. I mean,
they're not
based upon votes or anything of
the sort.

42:35.887 --> 42:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: But I think it
is important.
You know, he doesn't have
consistent views.

42:40.525 --> 42:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he changes his views, he
doesn't have
any reason for changing his
views, which is

42:44.228 --> 42:44.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just extraordinary.

42:44.962 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

42:46.798 --> 42:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: But it calls
attention to
the fact that he was never
offering policy

42:49.801 --> 42:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the first day of this
campaign.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

42:53.070 --> 42:56.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: On issues like
jobs, on issues
like immigration, what he's
arguing is that

42:56.274 --> 42:56.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he should be in charge.

42:56.974 --> 42:57.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: OK?

42:59.477 --> 43:02.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is an essentially
authoritarian appeal.
The people -- many people who
support him

43:02.513 --> 43:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are essentially giving up on
self-government,
saying he should take care of
it, he should

43:08.553 --> 43:09.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be in charge...

43:09.954 --> 43:11.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

43:11.722 --> 43:13.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: ... when, in
fact, this is
pretty weak hands to put in
charge.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to save a
little bit
of time for the Democrats, Mark.

43:15.359 --> 43:16.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bernie Sanders
won his 19th
primary this week, West
Virginia.

43:19.397 --> 43:21.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, he did.

43:21.199 --> 43:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a chance
that he could
be the nominee of the Democratic
Party?

43:24.268 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: There's a chance,
a very, very
slim chance, probably not a
realistic chance.

43:31.175 --> 43:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has an air of
inevitability
about winning the nomination.
But Bernie Sanders

43:35.680 --> 43:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has momentum. He's won 11 of the
last 16 contests.
He's won the last two. He has --
both races

43:43.254 --> 43:45.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in May. He's on his way in
Oregon.

43:46.057 --> 43:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, so he has this sense.
And he made
a very strong statement on
Tuesday night,

43:52.163 --> 43:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump would be
elected over my
dead body. We're going to stop
him.

43:56.300 --> 44:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He opposed him. So, Hillary
Clinton would
like to be rid of Bernie
Sanders. Bernie Sanders

44:01.706 --> 44:07.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a constituency of young
people, energy
and passion that she needs
desperately. She

44:07.311 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs desperately to win and her
campaign
needs that infusion of sort of
idealism. And

44:12.984 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think Bernie Sanders is
probably the only
agent who can deliver it.

44:16.420 --> 44:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, how does
this affect
what she needs to do between now
-- if she

44:21.125 --> 44:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the nominee -- between now
and November,
the fact that he's still in here
and Donald

44:24.662 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump sewed it up for the
Republicans?

44:26.597 --> 44:28.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, we are
seeing a significant
-- she's won the nomination,
essentially,

44:28.599 --> 44:30.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not certainly, but essentially.

44:30.501 --> 44:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're seeing that a significant
portion of
the Democratic Party wants to
humiliate her

44:34.772 --> 44:39.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
eve, though she's won the
nomination. That
is a serious thing. It points
out that she's

44:39.977 --> 44:43.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not a particularly strong
candidate. Trump
and Hillary Clinton are some of
the least

44:44.081 --> 44:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
liked politicians in America.

44:46.250 --> 44:50.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an extraordinary race.
There are many
people who are in the never
Trump camp, but

44:50.721 --> 44:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's also a number of people
who are in
the never Hillary camp. And that
race could

44:55.760 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be closer than people think.

44:57.728 --> 45:04.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: But Bernie
Sanders, in his defense,
he has -- he wants his campaign
to have stood

45:04.969 --> 45:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for something. And it has. It
certainly has.

45:07.538 --> 45:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he wants to carry it to the
fight for
the platform of the party, to
the positions.

45:13.344 --> 45:17.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think it's humiliation
of her that
drives him at this point. I
mean, he's been

45:17.315 --> 45:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through all of this for so long,
and he wants
his people to have their moment
in the sun.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's absolutely natural.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: But the alarm
bells are going
off. So, you have senators
pressuring him

45:28.359 --> 45:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get out of the race because
Trump looks
stronger than they thought.

45:31.696 --> 45:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's a new
phenomenon.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

45:34.632 --> 45:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gentlemen, we
thank you both.
We're going to leave it there.

45:42.907 --> 45:48.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Gerson, Mark Shields,
thank you.

45:48.412 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Each year, thousands of
seemingly healthy
young people suddenly die. And,
in many cases,

45:55.987 --> 45:58.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doctors aren't able to determine
the cause.

45:58.823 --> 46:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists in San Diego are
starting to solve
some of these medical mysteries
through a

46:03.227 --> 46:08.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
process called genetic
sequencing. What they're
learning can have a profound
ripple effect

46:08.899 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on surviving family members.

46:11.335 --> 46:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science reporter David Wagner
from our member
station KPBS in San Diego
reports.

46:16.907 --> 46:24.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Dardie Robinson
leads a typical
life in Portland, Oregon. She
spends her days

46:24.181 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working as a paralegal and
catching up with
all the kids she has raised.

46:28.653 --> 46:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But unknown to her, she was
carrying a genetic
mutation that left her and
family members

46:34.225 --> 46:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vulnerable to sudden heart
failure. A year-and-a-half
ago, she received an unexpected
call. It was

46:43.034 --> 46:44.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about her son, Daniel.

46:44.802 --> 46:53.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON, Mother: I got a
call out
of the blue from his girlfriend.
And -- sorry

46:53.844 --> 46:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- she said that paramedics were
there working
on Daniel, that she had found
him, that he

46:58.816 --> 47:02.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was blue and unresponsive.

47:02.319 --> 47:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I told her, I said, "Tell
him his momma
loves him."

47:05.256 --> 47:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she said, "Well, I'm sure he
can't hear
you."

47:08.259 --> 47:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said, "Tell him anyway."

47:09.360 --> 47:10.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And so she did.

47:10.761 --> 47:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: In tears, she left
the office
and got in her car.

47:14.999 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: And on the way
home, I got
the call that there was nothing
they could

47:20.538 --> 47:23.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do, and that he was gone.

47:23.808 --> 47:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Daniel was 29 and
otherwise
healthy. No one knew why he had
died so suddenly.

47:30.381 --> 47:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: That was, to
me, part of
the -- really the worst part, is
because the

47:34.952 --> 47:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
word to us initially was, they
thought that
he must have committed suicide,
he must have

47:42.760 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken something. And I kept
saying, that doesn't
make sense.

47:46.664 --> 47:51.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: An autopsy pointed
to problems
with his heart. And while she
was relieved

47:51.102 --> 47:55.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suicide was ruled out, the
autopsy left her
unsettled.

47:55.439 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this could kill Daniel at 29,
could it
strike her other biological
children?

48:00.277 --> 48:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: That was the
question. Is
it going to happen again? Which
one of my

48:06.984 --> 48:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids? Me? I'm OK if it's me, but
I'm not OK
if it's my kids.

48:11.722 --> 48:16.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Not long after she
received
the autopsy report, Dardie read
a Los Angeles

48:16.360 --> 48:20.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Times story about a study
happening in San
Diego.

48:20.564 --> 48:25.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scientists at the Scripps
Translational Science
Institute were using gene
sequencing to take

48:25.169 --> 48:31.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another look at cases like her
son's. They
wanted to perform what they
called molecular

48:31.475 --> 48:33.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
autopsies.

48:33.377 --> 48:36.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scripps research Ali Torkamani
says one of
the reasons they agreed to take
on Daniel's

48:37.014 --> 48:40.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case was a strong family history
of early
heart failure.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALI TORKAMANI, Scripps
Translational Science
Institute: The fact that there
was more than

48:42.720 --> 48:49.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one sudden death in the family
at a young
age sort of highlighted the
point for us,

48:49.527 --> 48:51.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is likely a genetic issue.

48:51.362 --> 48:55.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Daniel, at 29, was
by far the
youngest.

48:55.132 --> 48:57.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: So, this was my
dad. He as
in the Navy.

48:57.902 --> 49:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: But a number of
Dardie's relatives
had died from sudden heart
failure in their

49:01.772 --> 49:02.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
40s and 50s.

49:03.007 --> 49:04.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DARDIE ROBINSON: And then
there's little Mr.
Daniel.

49:05.042 --> 49:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: With strong clues
that Daniel's
death may have been related to
his DNA, the

49:09.580 --> 49:15.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scripps researchers sequenced
genes from Daniel's
heart tissue. They also
sequenced his parents'

49:15.452 --> 49:16.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
genes.

49:17.087 --> 49:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI TORKAMANI: And that's when
we found this
mutation in this gene, TRPM4.

49:19.924 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Torkamani says
mutations on
this gene have been known to
cause a disorder

49:24.662 --> 49:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called progressive familial
heart block. It
short-circuits the heart's
electrical signals,

49:30.067 --> 49:32.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eventually causing the heart to
just stop
beating.

49:32.136 --> 49:37.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI TORKAMANI: And it's that
mutation that
we believe is the cause of
sudden death in

49:37.741 --> 49:41.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daniel and in other family
members.

49:41.111 --> 49:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: "The mutation
is likely to
be positive for sudden death."

49:46.116 --> 49:50.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: The researchers
found the same
mutation in Dardie, who had
passed it down

49:50.120 --> 49:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Daniel. And because it's an
autosomal dominant
gene, there's a 50 percent
chance she passed

49:56.327 --> 49:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it down to her other children
too.

49:59.697 --> 50:05.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scripps director Eric Topol
oversees the study.
He says Dardie's case
illustrates how a genetic

50:05.636 --> 50:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovery in cases like this can
provide valuable,
even lifesaving information to
surviving family

50:11.809 --> 50:13.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

50:13.143 --> 50:14.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: There, he was
brand-new,
brand-new baby.

50:15.079 --> 50:16.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC TOPOL, Director, Scripps
Translational
Science Institute: Because this
is something

50:16.914 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is eminently preventable
with things
like a defibrillator. So,
whereas all these

50:23.153 --> 50:29.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
relatives through many
generations had sudden
death, we may be able to
actually preempt

50:29.493 --> 50:31.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this in the future.

50:31.462 --> 50:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Dardie is now
considering getting
a surgically implanted device to
protect her

50:35.099 --> 50:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart from what happened to
Daniel's. She's
also on a mission to get
relatives on her

50:41.205 --> 50:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side of the family tested for
the mutation.

50:44.008 --> 50:51.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARDIE ROBINSON: Daniel did
something significant.
He gave us answers that will
benefit not just

50:51.448 --> 50:57.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dozens, but potentially, down
the road, hundreds
of people, maybe even thousands,
because I

50:57.421 --> 51:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't believe that this is just
limited to
my family.

51:00.224 --> 51:04.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WAGNER: Not every case
Scripps looks
at is this clear-cut. But the
researchers

51:04.929 --> 51:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say certain discoveries they're
making could
end up preventing other sudden
deaths.

51:10.167 --> 51:14.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If this new approach to
autopsies becomes
more common, researchers say,
perhaps, in

51:14.438 --> 51:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future, fewer families will
have to live
with the pain of not knowing how
their loved

51:18.976 --> 51:20.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one died.

51:20.477 --> 51:26.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Many schools have adopted
zero-tolerance

51:38.929 --> 51:44.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policies on bullying. But are
these punishments
working to reduce the problem?
Columnist Wendy

third-grade
bully and wonders if he suffered
even more

51:51.041 --> 51:52.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than she did.

51:52.376 --> 51:57.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

52:01.418 --> 52:06.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight on "Washington Week":
Republicans
try to find unity, while Hillary
Clinton fights

52:06.557 --> 52:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a two-front campaign. And the
Obama administration's
action on transgender rights
raises questions

52:12.963 --> 52:15.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about civil rights and privacy.

52:15.232 --> 52:17.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's later tonight on
"Washington Week."

52:18.002 --> 52:24.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on "PBS NewsHour Weekend":
As Puerto Rico
struggles a huge national debt
and the Zika

52:24.174 --> 52:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
virus, it's working to solve
another crisis,
where to put the garbage.

52:28.779 --> 52:30.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a preview.

52:30.781 --> 52:34.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: During the past 30
years, the Environmental
Protection Agency has ordered
the closure

52:34.618 --> 52:40.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of more than 50 landfills across
the island
for leakage issues contaminating
groundwater

52:40.190 --> 52:43.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not being up to
environmental standards.

52:43.327 --> 52:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The landfill closures make
garbage disposal
even more challenging for
residents along

52:47.631 --> 52:53.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Martin Pena Channel. The
channel was once
400-feet-wide and 10-feet-deep,
popular for

52:53.437 --> 52:58.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swimming and fishing. Today, the
waterway,
clogged with garbage and sewage,
has shrunk

52:58.976 --> 53:01.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to 30-feet-wide and
three-feet-deep.

53:01.712 --> 53:07.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a magnet for mosquitoes,
potentially
