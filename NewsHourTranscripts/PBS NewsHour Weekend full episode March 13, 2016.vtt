10:14.833 --> 10:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIX YEARS LONGER THAN A POOR MAN

BORN THAT SAME YEAR.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT FOR A MAN BORN IN 1950, THAT

10:21.000 --> 10:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED

10:45.733 --> 10:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAP GROWING?

10:46.133 --> 10:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL THAT'S PERHAPS THE MOST

10:48.267 --> 10:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING QUESTION BUT ONE OF

10:49.267 --> 10:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THINGS TO PUT INTO

10:50.933 --> 10:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THIS GAP HAS

10:52.700 --> 10:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN GROWING FOR PROBABLY THE

10:54.033 --> 10:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST 50 YEARS.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RICH

10:56.467 --> 10:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND POOR WAS GETTING SMALLER AND

10:59.367 --> 10:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALLER.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH A GREAT PART OF THE

11:02.400 --> 11:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1900S THROUGH ABOUT 1950 OR 60.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN SOMETHING STARTED TO

11:07.167 --> 11:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT FLIP SUGGESTS THAT

11:09.467 --> 11:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT OUR

11:11.900 --> 11:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENT, SOMETHING ABOUT OUR

11:12.900 --> 11:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SET OF POLICIES, THAT WOULD

11:14.700 --> 11:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRIVE THAT.

11:16.633 --> 11:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE REALLY CLEVER THING ABOUT

11:19.300 --> 11:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BROOKINGS STUDY WHICH IS

11:21.833 --> 11:24.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY OUTSTANDING IS THEY

11:24.367 --> 11:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDED EACH BIRTH COHORT, IF

11:26.633 --> 11:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WERE BORN IN 1940S THEY

11:30.133 --> 11:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVIDED YOU INTO 10 PERCENTAGE

11:32.733 --> 11:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT DECILES, PEOPLE AT THE

11:35.100 --> 11:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

11:48.700 --> 11:51.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIX TO EIGHT YEARS.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM STAYED THE

11:53.333 --> 11:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAME AND ALL THE BENEFITS THAT

11:55.967 --> 12:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HAPPENED IN THE TERMS OF

12:01.600 --> 12:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE LAST

12:03.200 --> 12:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS HAVE OCCURRED FOR THE

12:04.800 --> 12:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEST-OFF IN THIS COUNTRY.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: DO THE RICH

EXPERIENCE LIFE BETTER THAN THE

12:11.267 --> 12:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POOR DO?

12:13.000 --> 12:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE KNOW THAT PHYSICAL HEALTH,

12:17.100 --> 12:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMOKING MAY EXPLAIN PART OF THE

12:19.033 --> 12:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE IN THIS INEQUALITY,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THESE

12:23.233 --> 12:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHAVIORS ACTUALLY EXPLAIN VERY

12:24.900 --> 12:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN IN FACT IN THE BROOKINGS

12:27.900 --> 12:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORT THEY EXAMINED THAT QUITE

12:29.733 --> 12:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAREFULLY AND CAME TO THE

12:31.200 --> 12:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSION THAT BEHAVIORS WERE

12:32.000 --> 12:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT THE ANSWER TO THIS.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THE TYPE OF

12:35.000 --> 12:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WORK THE POOR DO, IF THE POOR

12:40.767 --> 12:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE IN COAL MINES OR AMONG

12:45.000 --> 12:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHEMICAL NOXIOUS FUMES, DOES

12:47.700 --> 12:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT START TO FACTOR INTO THIS?

12:49.833 --> 12:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK SO.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY A SET OF JOB EXPOSURES

12:53.167 --> 12:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS INTERESTING THE ONES YOU

12:55.933 --> 12:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICK, THE PHYSICALLY DEMANDING

12:57.333 --> 12:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

KINDS OF ACCIDENTS THAT PEOPLE

13:00.867 --> 13:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USED TO HAVE AT THE TURN OF THE

13:02.567 --> 13:06.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTURY, THAT HAS BEEN A HUGE

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY.

13:11.233 --> 13:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT MEANS IN SOME WAY THAT

13:13.133 --> 13:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER SET OF EXPOSURES THAT

13:16.067 --> 13:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE RELATED TO WORK MIGHT BE ON

13:23.500 --> 13:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

14:17.167 --> 14:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT THAN LIVING IN A ZIP

14:18.433 --> 14:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CODE THAT WAS MUCH BETTER OFF.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: I REMEMBER

14:21.267 --> 14:24.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING IN BALTIMORE LAST YEAR AND

14:24.467 --> 14:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITERAL A DIFFERENCE OF SIX

14:27.000 --> 14:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLOCKS WAS MASSIVE DIFFERENCE.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU COULD GET ON THE SUBWAY

14:30.667 --> 14:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS FIVE

14:32.500 --> 14:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS DIFFERENT OR SIX YEARS

14:33.967 --> 14:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW AGAIN THE REASONS FOR THAT

14:36.533 --> 14:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE PRETTY INTERESTING TO THINK

14:38.000 --> 14:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO

14:39.333 --> 14:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT THEY ARE OUGHT

14:42.633 --> 14:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTRIBUTED TO -- ALL ATTRIBUTED

14:44.333 --> 14:45.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THAT NEIGHBORHOOD OR TO THE

14:45.467 --> 14:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY.

14:46.033 --> 14:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT MAY BE THAT THERE ARE SOME

14:49.033 --> 14:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIGHBORHOOD BE VARIABLES OR

14:51.467 --> 14:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDITIONS THAT ARE VERY RISKY.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW THAT PHYSICAL POLLUTION,

14:56.200 --> 14:58.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES, TOXIC

14:58.667 --> 15:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPOSURES GET MORE CONCENTRATED

15:00.267 --> 15:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN POOR AREAS.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN POOR

15:02.867 --> 15:04.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIGHBORHOODS CAN BE MORE

15:04.067 --> 15:06.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPOSED TO PHYSICAL

15:06.567 --> 15:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENTS.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH NOXIOUS KIND OF RISKS.

15:10.533 --> 15:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR SOCIAL

15:13.567 --> 15:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISKS COULD BE DIFFERENT, LEVELS

15:15.367 --> 15:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VIOLENCE COULD BE DIFFERENT

15:17.033 --> 15:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS JOB

15:19.133 --> 15:20.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITIES, ACCESS TO HEALTHY

15:20.667 --> 15:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOOD, PLACES TO EXERCISE, ALL OF

15:22.467 --> 15:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE THINGS ARE PATTERNED BY

15:24.700 --> 15:25.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:25.267 --> 15:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHERE WE LIVE IS A VERY

15:29.400 --> 15:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF THIS

15:30.833 --> 15:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING INEQUALITY.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK

15:35.100 --> 15:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHERE WE LIVE, WHERE WE

15:38.133 --> 15:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK, AND PROBABLY, HOW OUR

15:40.267 --> 15:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILIES ARE CONSTITUTED.

15:44.033 --> 15:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DOES ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

15:48.000 --> 15:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEM TO AFFECT THIS AT ALL?

15:49.167 --> 15:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT SEEMS ACCESS TO HEALTH IS

15:52.100 --> 15:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT AND THE HEALTH CARE IS

15:54.533 --> 15:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRIBLY IMPORTANT IN PROVIDING

15:56.467 --> 15:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCESS AND IMPROVEMENTS.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HEALTH INSURANCE HAS ANOTHER

15:59.267 --> 16:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOAL WHICH IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT

16:00.767 --> 16:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF POVERTY.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ANOTHER IDEA IS IF YOU HAD A

16:04.333 --> 16:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEART ATTACK YOU COULD EASILY BE

16:07.000 --> 16:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SWAMPED WITH THE COST ASSOCIATED

16:08.733 --> 16:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HOSPITALIZATION AND YOU

16:09.633 --> 16:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR JOB.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY NUMBER OF BAD THINGS WOULD

16:15.100 --> 16:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN.

16:15.567 --> 16:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HEALTH INSURANCE CAN BE GOOD

16:17.167 --> 16:19.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR YOU -- SO HEAL INSURANCE

16:19.367 --> 16:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE GOOD FOR YOU BY SORT OF

16:21.567 --> 16:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVENTING ECONOMIC SHOCKS.

16:22.267 --> 16:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER EXISTING

16:25.733 --> 16:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WE HAVE,

16:27.867 --> 16:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE?

16:29.367 --> 16:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

16:30.833 --> 16:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLES OF PUBLIC POLICIES THAT

16:32.400 --> 16:32.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO WORK.

16:32.867 --> 16:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT

16:35.200 --> 16:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

16:40.000 --> 16:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCOURAGES MEN AN WOMEN TO STAY

16:41.233 --> 16:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE LABOR FORCE AND IT DOES

16:43.367 --> 16:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SUCCESSFULLY.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ALSO TURNS OUT THAT IT

16:46.567 --> 16:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMOTES HEALTHY BIRTHS AND

16:48.800 --> 16:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFANCY AND WOMEN WHO ARE ON --

16:51.333 --> 16:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO GET AN EARNED INCOME TAX

16:53.933 --> 16:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREDIT ACTUALLY SMOKE LESS.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICARE MEDICAID CERTAINLY ARE

16:57.967 --> 16:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICIES THAT WILL SOON BE

16:59.833 --> 17:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LINKED TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE

17:02.767 --> 17:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACT.

17:03.267 --> 17:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE

17:04.000 --> 17:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER POLICIES THAT YOU SEE THAT

17:05.300 --> 17:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE COULD TRY TO THINK ABOUT OR

17:06.867 --> 17:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIDUCIARY FORWARD THAT WOULD

17:08.033 --> 17:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY WORK ON THIS GAP?

17:09.033 --> 17:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ONE OF THE MOST FORTUNATE

17:12.367 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREAS WE SUSPECT IS IMPORTANT IS

17:14.400 --> 17:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WORK-FAMILY FLEXIBILITY SET

17:17.333 --> 17:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ISSUES.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE ARE VIRTUALLY THE ONLY

17:20.233 --> 17:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT

17:22.100 --> 17:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T HAVE A FEDERAL FAMILY

17:25.000 --> 17:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE PROVISION.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCEPT AN UNPAID FAMILY MEDICAL

17:28.633 --> 17:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE.

17:29.167 --> 17:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT MIGHT GO VERY, VERY

17:31.600 --> 17:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAR.

17:32.133 --> 17:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN FACT WE HAVE DATA FROM

17:33.567 --> 17:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE THAT IN COUNTRIES WHERE

17:35.000 --> 17:37.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WERE EXPOSED TO FAMILY

17:37.867 --> 17:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAVE POLICIES, WHEN THEY WERE

17:40.267 --> 17:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OLDER, THEY WERE HEALTHIER, THEY

17:43.067 --> 17:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE LESS DEPRESSED, AND THEY

17:45.100 --> 17:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID IN THE WORKFORCE.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- AND THEY STAYED IN THE

17:49.000 --> 17:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKFORCE LONGER.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT

17:52.067 --> 17:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A IS THE OF POLICIES AROUND WORK

17:54.533 --> 17:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FAMILY ISSUES, FLEXIBILITY

17:56.933 --> 17:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO THINK

17:58.933 --> 18:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY QUITE

18:01.667 --> 18:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAREFULLY.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THANKS SO

INDUSTRY.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY

20:10.600 --> 20:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE BOTTOM

LINE.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE

20:25.433 --> 20:25.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT MORE?

20:25.867 --> 20:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, THIS -- IN 1978

20:28.133 --> 20:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS PASSED A BILL TO

20:30.033 --> 20:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEREGULATE THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

20:31.100 --> 20:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE WAS NO GOVERNMENT

20:33.067 --> 20:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVENTION IN WHAT FARES WOULD

20:35.100 --> 20:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE, WHAT ROUTES WOULD BE, WHAT

20:37.067 --> 20:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIRLINES FLY.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

20:39.333 --> 20:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREA WHERE CONGRESS WOULD GET

20:40.700 --> 20:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVOLVED AND SAY THERE ARE SOME

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULES ON WHAT YOU CAN CHARGE AND

20:44.000 --> 20:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT CHARGE THE PUBLIC FOR BAGS

20:46.233 --> 20:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TICKET CHANGES AND THAT.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS WOULD BE A REALLY FAIRLY

20:49.600 --> 20:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE THAT YOU

20:51.133 --> 20:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, THAT IMPOSES A PRETTY BIG

20:53.167 --> 20:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HURDLE FOR THIS BILL TO GET

20:54.867 --> 20:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORWARD.

20:55.267 --> 20:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU'RE WRITING ABOUT IT YOU

20:56.767 --> 20:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIT WAS A LONG SHOT, IS THAT THE

20:59.467 --> 20:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASON?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S A LONG SHOT BECAUSE THE

21:01.467 --> 21:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT CONGRESS WOULD GET

21:02.633 --> 21:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO PRICING AND CONGRESS DOES

21:05.133 --> 21:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY NOT GET INTO THE BUSINESS

21:07.833 --> 21:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PRICING FOR COMPANIES.

21:11.067 --> 21:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: AIRLINES ARE

21:13.733 --> 21:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSHING BACK, HOW SO?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY PUT OUT A STATEMENT THEY

21:16.333 --> 21:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T LIKE THIS BILL.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE QUESTION IS HOW FAR DOES IT

21:19.033 --> 21:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED TO ADVANCE BEFORE THEY PUSH

21:20.567 --> 21:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:21.233 --> 21:25.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
