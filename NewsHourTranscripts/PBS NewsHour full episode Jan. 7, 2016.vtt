GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.608 --> 00:13.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Open
just 30 minutes,
China's stock market shuts down
again to stem

00:13.680 --> 00:18.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major losses, driving investor
skittishness
across the globe.

00:18.952 --> 00:23.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: how the race for the
White House
is playing on and off the air.
We dissect

00:24.024 --> 00:25.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ads, and the money.

00:25.826 --> 00:31.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a new true crime
documentary, "Making
a Murderer," raises questions
about justice

00:32.032 --> 00:33.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in America.

00:33.667 --> 00:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, the economic science of
altruism, or
why it pays to be good to
others.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN, University of
British Columbia:
What we found is that people
who'd been randomly

00:41.275 --> 00:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assigned to spend this money on
somebody else
felt better by the end of the
day than people

00:45.379 --> 00:48.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who'd been assigned to spend
that same small
amount of money on themselves.

00:48.048 --> 00:55.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.956 --> 00:58.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.792 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Call it the great
fall. An explosive
new sell-off hit the Chinese
market today,

01:09.836 --> 01:15.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and routed stocks around the
world. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average lost

01:15.442 --> 01:24.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
392 points to close at 16514.
The Nasdaq fell
146 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 47. We

01:24.918 --> 01:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will look at what's going on in
China right
after the news summary.

01:29.389 --> 01:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news, a
powerful truck
bomb in Libya killed at least 47
people and

01:34.661 --> 01:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wounded more than 100 others.
The target was
a police training center outside
Tripoli,

01:40.701 --> 01:46.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where hundreds of recruits had
gathered. Cars
lay crushed and strewn around
the area after

01:46.406 --> 01:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the blast. It was the country's
worst bombing
since the fall of Moammar
Gadhafi in 2011

01:52.646 --> 01:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it was quickly condemned.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD ISMAIL, Government of
National Salvation
(through translator): We confirm
that we are

01:57.484 --> 02:02.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
totally committed to carrying
out a full investigation
and following developments and
updates and

02:02.422 --> 02:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
providing full disclosure that
deals with
this cowardly terrorist act.

02:05.993 --> 02:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The government based
in Tripoli
is an Islamist regime. A rival
government

02:11.365 --> 02:16.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operates in Eastern Libya, along
with various
armed factions.

02:16.036 --> 02:21.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Yemen, dozens of Saudi
airstrikes hit the
capital city in the heaviest
bombardment yet.

02:21.842 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Saudis and other Sunni Arab
states are
supporting Yemen's president
against Shiite

02:26.880 --> 02:33.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebels. Today's attacks hit the
presidential
palace in Sanaa and a rebel
military base.

02:33.053 --> 02:38.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, loyalist forces also
landed at
a key port overnight, opening a
new front.

02:38.792 --> 02:44.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran claimed its embassy in
Sanaa was hit
by the airstrikes, but there was
no visible

02:44.364 --> 02:46.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
damage.

02:46.233 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paris spent a tense anniversary
today, one
year since Islamist gunmen
attacked the satirical

02:51.705 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing
11 people.
The city was already on edge
when an apparent

02:57.310 --> 03:03.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide bomber, with a note
referencing the
Islamic State group, confronted
police.

03:03.116 --> 03:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alex Thomson of Independent
Television News
reports from Paris.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: It's around midday
in the Gare
du Nord in Central Paris, and a
young man

03:11.024 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carrying a butchers hatchet,
shouting Allahu
akbar and wearing what looks
like an explosive

03:16.563 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
belt approaches a small police
station.

03:19.299 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
heard gunshots,
four, I think. It's just across
the street

03:24.738 --> 03:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the school, next to the
police station,
where there's a kindergarten.

03:27.741 --> 03:33.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Usually, I see
this on the television. And it's
true, it's

03:33.046 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shocking to see this unfolding
live.

03:35.215 --> 03:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: It's a busy area.
People quickly
surrounded the body before it
was eventually

03:40.387 --> 03:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stretchered away, but only after
a remote
controlled approach to what was
initially

03:46.893 --> 03:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assumed to be a real suicide
belt device.

03:50.664 --> 03:55.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may well never know what this
man's motivations
were, nor if he had any real
connection with

03:55.602 --> 04:01.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I.S., or Da'esh, but after the
events in recent
months, not just in Paris, but
across Europe,

04:01.341 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody approaching armed
officers with a
butcher's hatchet, apparent
signs of an explosive

04:05.879 --> 04:10.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
device, and shouting allahu
Akbar, is signing
their own death warrant.

04:11.017 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this a year to the day
from the massacre
across town at the satirical
magazine Charlie

04:16.857 --> 04:24.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hebdo -- the journalists killed
there remembered
today. And whether this man
actually had any

04:24.464 --> 04:30.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
connection to I.S., the
president of France
spoke today as if the incident
had been masterminded

04:30.470 --> 04:32.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Raqqa.

04:32.305 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): Inside France, we
are tackling

04:36.977 --> 04:41.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it by hunting down terrorists,
dismantling
networks, drying up sources of
financing,

04:41.481 --> 04:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and by blocking the propaganda
of radicalization.

04:44.451 --> 04:50.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Later in the day,
the interior
minister, Bernard Cazeneuve,
visited the scene,

04:50.991 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expressing solidarity with
police officers.
Paris remains understandably
edgy, and today's

04:56.096 --> 04:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incident merely underscores
that.

04:58.365 --> 05:03.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Charlie Hebdo
killings last
January were followed by the
attacks in November

05:03.837 --> 05:07.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that claimed another 130 lives.

05:07.140 --> 05:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea is firing up its
cross-border
propaganda broadcasts against
the North again.

05:12.512 --> 05:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's announcement came a day
after North
Korea tested what it said was a
hydrogen bomb.

05:17.450 --> 05:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The South's earlier broadcasts
ended in August
in a bid to ease tensions with
the communist

05:23.056 --> 05:28.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North. They're due to resume
tomorrow, the
birthday of North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, there's
word that efforts
to extend health insurance
coverage to all

05:33.033 --> 05:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans stalled in 2015. A
closely watched
survey out today finds nearly 12
percent of

05:39.439 --> 05:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. adults still lacked health
coverage at
the end of the year. The
Gallup-Healthways

05:44.377 --> 05:50.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well-Being Index says that was
virtually unchanged
from 12 months earlier.

05:50.584 --> 05:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 2015 officially goes down as
the second
warmest year in the United
States since they

05:55.989 --> 06:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started keeping records 121
years ago. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration

06:02.128 --> 06:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports the average temperature
was 54.4 degrees.
That's about one degree shy of
the record,

06:08.401 --> 06:10.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
set in 2012.

06:10.971 --> 06:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
why China's
stock market is plummeting;
who's spending

06:15.675 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much, and for what, in the
2016 race for
the White House; what's not in
the new national

06:22.349 --> 06:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dietary guidelines; and much
more.

06:32.392 --> 06:38.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dietary guidelines; and much
more.

06:38.331 --> 06:44.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In just 29 minutes today,
China's stock market
plunged 7 percent, and then was
shut down

06:44.671 --> 06:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
altogether for the day. It's the
second time
in just four days the China
markets have crashed

06:50.176 --> 06:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
badly, sending major ripples
around the world,
including on Wall Street, where
the Dow dropped

06:56.149 --> 07:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly 400 points, and continued
a two-week
slide.

07:00.620 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at what's behind the
great fall
in China with David Wessel,
director of the

07:05.225 --> 07:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hutchins Center on Fiscal and
Monetary Policy
at the Brookings Institution. He
is also a

07:10.463 --> 07:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contributing correspondent to
The Wall Street
Journal.

07:13.366 --> 07:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, help us puzzle this out.
China's economy
or at least its markets are not
that big,

07:18.305 --> 07:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the reverberations certainly
were.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: That's
right.

07:20.473 --> 07:21.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
China's economy is pretty big.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: And I think the
one thing that's
going on here is that people are
saying, uh-oh,

07:26.479 --> 07:30.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Chinese economy might be
slowing more
than we thought and the
government is having

07:30.917 --> 07:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hard time stimulating it
again.

07:33.219 --> 07:36.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's one thing. There's
worries about
that. But you're absolutely
right. China's

07:36.656 --> 07:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stock market is not very big.
And yet when
stock market has a bad day in
China, it seems,

07:42.195 --> 07:44.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe has a bad day and then we
have a bad
day.

07:44.197 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What's that
connection between
a 7 percent drop in China and a
400-point

07:48.234 --> 07:50.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drop here?

07:50.070 --> 07:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I think it's hard
to understand
in economics. It's easier to
understand on

07:53.239 --> 07:55.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
psychology.

07:55.075 --> 07:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a kind of panic or a sense
that the world
economy is just not in as good
shape as we

07:59.245 --> 08:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought and so everybody is
chasing everybody
else.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And that is
something in which
this psychological panic is
always what drives

08:05.618 --> 08:08.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
markets, not necessarily
anything that makes
any other kind of economic
sense.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is the fact that --
people have
had a lot of confidence that the
Chinese leadership

08:13.193 --> 08:16.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could fix what is wrong with
their economy
so it wouldn't have ripple
effects around

08:16.963 --> 08:21.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the world. I think that
confidence is being
shaken by how difficult it is
for them to

08:21.167 --> 08:22.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manage their stock market and
their currency.

08:22.969 --> 08:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about managing
the currency that was part of
the solution

08:27.340 --> 08:32.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, which is to let the
currency fall. But
that seems to be making it
worse?

08:32.612 --> 08:34.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

08:34.314 --> 08:37.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was seen as a symptom
that the
Chinese leadership may be really
scared about

08:37.984 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their economy. Why would they
want their currency
to fall? Well, the only reason
you would want

08:42.655 --> 08:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your currency to fall, if you
could control
it, is in order to get more
exports. Why would

08:47.160 --> 08:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you want to depend more on
exports if you're
a country that has a stated
policy of relying

08:51.865 --> 08:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less on exports and more on
consumer spending,
domestic spending?

08:55.935 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They must be worried about
consumer spending
not being as strong as they had
thought.

08:58.772 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And then stopping
trading mid-trade,
that -- I remember when that
happened on Wall

09:03.209 --> 09:07.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Street here, and it sent
complete panic throughout
all the investors here.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I think the
Chinese are really
amateurs when it comes to
running markets.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Ah.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: They don't really
believe in
markets. They like stability,
they like control.

09:16.322 --> 09:20.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have circuit-breakers here
and if the
stock market falls some, we take
a pause in

09:20.593 --> 09:25.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trading, but in the U.S., stocks
have to fall
20 percent before we shut down
trading for

09:25.932 --> 09:27.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the day.

09:27.734 --> 09:32.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chinese shut down trading
after only 7
percent. And I think what they
put in as a

09:32.439 --> 09:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to make people collect their
wits, cool
down a little bit, has, instead,
accelerated

09:37.310 --> 09:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
panic. I wouldn't be at all
surprised if they
change the rules.

09:39.779 --> 09:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you expect that
there will
be continued volatility there as
well as here?

09:44.350 --> 09:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, nobody
really knows what
the market is going to do, but
it sure looks

09:47.587 --> 09:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like we are going to have a lot
more volatility.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: At some point,
people may decide
that the U.S. stock market has
fallen enough.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After all, the U.S. economy
seems to be getting
better, that what happens in
China is not

09:58.965 --> 10:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have that devastating
effect on car
sales here or how many people
buy Apple phones

10:04.170 --> 10:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or what happens at -- how many
people shop
at Wal-Mart.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may be that the U.S. stock
market starts
to rise if people think it's
gone far enough.

10:12.879 --> 10:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But you have alluded
to the fact
that people are worried that is
not what is

10:16.182 --> 10:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening with the Chinese
economy, that in
fact it may not be that
resilient.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Right. That's the
fear.

10:21.621 --> 10:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have put a lot of faith
in the government's
ability to get growth going in
China. People

10:26.426 --> 10:30.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have this, what I think,
illusion that there
are six people in China who
really have their

10:30.396 --> 10:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hand on every button. And what
we're learning
is, it's a very big economy and
they're not

10:34.701 --> 10:36.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that good at it.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people's confidence in their
leadership
has been shaken. If the
government can't get

10:40.440 --> 10:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy moving again, they
have a lot
of fundamental problems. They
may now show

10:44.244 --> 10:46.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is there a way to
draw a loop
between what's happening in
China's economy,

10:47.981 --> 10:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is happening here, and what
is happening
with the depressed price of oil
around the

10:52.085 --> 10:52.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world?

10:52.919 --> 10:54.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Yes. Yes, there
is.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think oil prices are down for
two reasons.
One is, there is a lot of
supply. There is

10:57.790 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of supply because the U.S.
now produces
a lot of oil and there is a lot
of supply

11:01.928 --> 11:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the Saudis seem to want
to produce
a lot of oil, maybe to punish
the Iranians

11:06.366 --> 11:08.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the Russians.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is also a concern that
there is
a lack of demand of oil. And so
when commodity

11:11.237 --> 11:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prices fall, it's good if you
happen to be
a consumer, but it's sometimes
seen as symptom

11:15.675 --> 11:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a weakening economy. So I
think that exacerbates
the feel that maybe China is
slowing down.

11:21.247 --> 11:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means it will be buying
less from Africa
and Latin America. That means
Procter &amp; Gamble

11:25.285 --> 11:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Coca-Cola will sell less in
Latin America
and Africa. And so it is
definitely related.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Fascinating.

11:31.724 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Wessel, thanks, as usual,
for clearing
it all up for us.

11:35.662 --> 11:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

11:43.136 --> 11:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One sign that
presidential primaries
are near, candidates are
starting to ramp

11:50.843 --> 11:53.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up their TV ad spending.

11:53.046 --> 11:57.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins takes a
look at the mountain of cash
being spent on

11:57.417 --> 11:59.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ads, and whether it's worth it.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm Marco Rubio.

12:01.688 --> 12:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The much-used
and often reviled
campaign ad faces a real test in
2016. First,

12:08.161 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sheer numbers could break
records: Some
experts estimate we will see an
astonishing

12:13.366 --> 12:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$4.4 billion in political TV
ads. But ads
so far have not brought results
for some.

12:20.273 --> 12:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Serious
times require serious
leadership.

12:24.077 --> 12:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican Jeb
Bush has spent
more on ads than any other
candidate, but

12:28.948 --> 12:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he is stalled in fifth or sixth
place.

12:30.750 --> 12:36.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER FENN, Democratic
Strategist: I have
to say it's pay more, get less.
TV advertising

12:36.489 --> 12:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not nearly as effective as it
once was,
especially high-level races.

12:40.860 --> 12:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Peter Fenn is
president of
Fenn Communications and has
worked in over

12:44.564 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
300 campaigns.

12:46.366 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: Jeb Bush's idea
initially was
to buy a lot of advertising, to
use the $100

12:51.270 --> 12:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million that he'd raise for the
super PAC
and to flood Iowa and flood New
Hampshire.

12:56.209 --> 13:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It has not
worked yet. But
front-runner Donald Trump is
trying ads nonetheless,

13:01.814 --> 13:03.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
launching his first this week.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Donald Trump calls it
radical Islamic
terrorism.

13:06.419 --> 13:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With dark
colors and striking
music, the spot talks of fears,
but it may

13:11.190 --> 13:13.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also address one of Trump's
worries.

13:13.459 --> 13:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: I think his fear is
that he needs
a strong turnout. If people
don't see him

13:19.999 --> 13:25.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in paid ads, don't see him going
all out in
these states, it might
discourage some of

13:25.672 --> 13:27.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his voters from voting.

13:27.473 --> 13:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another ad with
strong tones
from Ted Cruz using a visual
metaphor at the

13:33.312 --> 13:35.148 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I understand that when the
mainstream covers

13:36.549 --> 13:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration, it often doesn't
see it as an
economic issue.

13:39.218 --> 13:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: Cruz, I think with
his ad this
time of people dressed in suits
and women

13:44.657 --> 13:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in high heels walking across
what would be
the border, visually, people now
are looking

13:51.497 --> 13:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for more creativity in their
advertising.

13:53.633 --> 13:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Contrast those
hard-hitting
ads in the crowded GOP race with
the approach

13:58.671 --> 14:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the smaller Democratic field,
which is
more biographical.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Praised as one of
America's best
mayors, who governed as a
pragmatist.

14:04.977 --> 14:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
When I think about why I'm doing
this, I think

14:09.982 --> 14:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about my mother, Dorothy.

14:11.784 --> 14:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Both of those
got big play
online. But Fenn says 70 percent
of campaign

14:16.756 --> 14:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ad dollars still go to on-air.

14:18.858 --> 14:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: My sense is, this is
changing,
but we're still going to see, in
this election

14:24.664 --> 14:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cycle, television will be king.

14:26.466 --> 14:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But for all the
dollars it
brings, we don't yet know how
much television

14:31.070 --> 14:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will influence the choice for
president.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

14:35.775 --> 14:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We follow the money
now with Matea
Gold. She's a national political
reporter

14:40.580 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Washington Post.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matea, you have covered a lot of
these campaigns,
as have I. We're not going to
say how old

14:45.752 --> 14:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are. But compare this to last
cycle. How
is the money being raised
differently and

14:50.156 --> 14:51.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spent differently?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington Post:
So, what
we have seen in this cycle is
the real full

14:54.060 --> 14:59.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flowering of the super PAC
effect, and nearly
every presidential candidate,
with the exception

14:59.565 --> 15:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Bernie Sanders and most
recently Donald
Trump, are running with the
support of super

15:03.936 --> 15:05.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PACs this time.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's changed everything.
That's changed
the way they have gotten in the
race, how

15:08.374 --> 15:12.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have raised money, and it's
changed the
way money is being spent. And
already through

15:12.078 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mid-December, we saw more than
40 percent
more ads on TV than in the last
cycle at that

15:17.483 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point. And eight out of 10 of
those ads were
by outside groups.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And as Lisa pointed
out in her
piece, it's not biographical.
It's not let

15:24.724 --> 15:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me tell you who I am anymore.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, one of the
things that I
think we're seeing in the
Republican contest

15:29.428 --> 15:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, because it is so incredibly
competitive,
and it's really been focused on
issues about

15:35.101 --> 15:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism and ISIS, that those
issues have
really come to the fore in the
advertising

15:39.372 --> 15:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much sooner than I think you
usually see at
this point in a campaign.

15:42.208 --> 15:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So who benefits so
far, especially
in the crowded Republican field,
from this

15:47.146 --> 15:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach? For whom is this
approach resonating?

15:49.515 --> 15:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, I think there
is a really
big question about whether the
super PAC is

15:53.853 --> 15:58.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be the real panacea
that some people
thought it was going to be in
this election.

15:58.357 --> 16:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We already saw two candidates,
Scott Walker
and Rick Perry, forced out of
the contest,

16:03.062 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though they had millions of
dollars left
in their super PACs. There is a
real question

16:07.099 --> 16:10.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about whether you can succeed
with the support
of super PACs or whether you
need really more

16:10.937 --> 16:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
substantial resources in your
campaign.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, so then,
explain for us
just one example.

16:16.642 --> 16:21.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Jeb Bush -- you wrote about
this in a
big piece in The Washington Post
this week.

16:21.113 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Jeb Bush got into the
field, people thought
he was going to be able to do
what his brother

16:26.018 --> 16:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did, clear the field by the
sheer amount of
money he raised. He raised the
money, but

16:30.756 --> 16:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he clearly didn't clear the
field. What happened?

16:32.825 --> 16:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Money is very
different in this
election than in past elections.

16:36.229 --> 16:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, it's been seen as a
predictor
of success. When money comes,
there's also

16:41.400 --> 16:47.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a sense that there is a
grassroots support
behind that. Now that donors
that are incredibly

16:47.173 --> 16:51.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wealthy can give these massive
donations,
it's not necessarily indicative
of any deeper

16:51.844 --> 16:53.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the challenges I
think that Jeb
Bush has had is translating the
support he

16:55.915 --> 17:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has among the millionaire class,
who really
put in amazing amount of
resources in the

17:00.086 --> 17:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
super PAC, to support on the
ground. And so
while he had a huge amount of
money, other

17:04.690 --> 17:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates also had their own
billionaires
supporting them, and they
weren't scared away

17:08.427 --> 17:10.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by his coffers.

17:10.096 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Another example, Ben
Carson was
raising money hand over fist for
a while.

17:13.866 --> 17:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was reflecting his
standing in the
polls. Now his standing in the
polls has dropped.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it because he didn't spend
the money correctly?

17:20.206 --> 17:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, he still is
raising a substantial
amount. He raised $20 million in
the last

17:26.245 --> 17:27.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quarter.

17:27.947 --> 17:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that online
fund-raising
allows you to do is reach out to
a cohort

17:31.918 --> 17:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of non-traditional donors. These
aren't professional
donors that get involved in
party politics.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ben Carson brought a lot of new
people into
the process. And it looks like a
lot of them

17:39.859 --> 17:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are still giving him money.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But how is he
spending it?

17:42.528 --> 17:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, a lot of that
money has
gone back into raising more
money. And we

17:45.464 --> 17:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to get some more
details about his
finances when the reports come
out at the

17:49.168 --> 17:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of this month. But that is
going to be
a real indicator of a campaign's
success,

17:53.706 --> 17:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much cash they actually have
left on hand
heading into this last final
stretch.

17:57.343 --> 18:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We talked about the
billionaires.
What is it? Bernie Sanders calls
them the

18:02.982 --> 18:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
millionaires and billionaires.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who are they this time? Are they
spending
their money differently? Last
time, I remember

18:07.853 --> 18:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sheldon Adelson kept Newt
Gingrich in the
race simply by writing a check
for a long

18:12.491 --> 18:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, and I think also Rick
Santorum. And
last time, we saw Ron Burkle,
another millionaire,

18:18.731 --> 18:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving money to the Clintons.
This time, he
is supporting John Kasich, at
least for now.

18:23.636 --> 18:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to be a different --
I don't know,
just a different way of
organizing this.

18:27.974 --> 18:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: One of the things
that's so interesting
is that the donor class has
expanded. We're

18:31.644 --> 18:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing new names that are not
your traditional
political givers.

18:35.448 --> 18:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the biggest backers of
Senator Ted
Cruz are a family in Texas, the
Wilks brothers,

18:41.921 --> 18:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have made a lot of money
through fracking.
And they have put together $15
million worth

18:46.359 --> 18:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of contributions into a super
PAC supporting
Ted Cruz.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a lot of folks who are
not bold-faced
names in the political world are
getting engaged,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in part because there are these
new mechanisms
for them to do so.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and here is
something that
is completely different than
anything we have

18:59.005 --> 19:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen before, which is, of
course, is the rise
of Donald Trump before he had
even spent a

19:02.641 --> 19:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of money. And even though
now he's starting
to put ads on the air, it seems
like he's

19:06.379 --> 19:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
changed the formula as well.

19:08.247 --> 19:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: The Trump impact has
completely
transformed how money is being
spent and whether

19:13.152 --> 19:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's even effective this time.

19:15.454 --> 19:20.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His rivals complain he's
basically getting
free airtime. And so their paid
media is not

19:20.326 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be as potent, because
he's getting
even more airtime just getting
on cable news.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is going to be a real
question. He's
started to spend money now, but
will he actually

19:29.001 --> 19:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to succeed largely
through earned
media?

19:31.404 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is this something
that the candidates
are scrambling to counter,
specifically to

19:36.208 --> 19:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with Trump or specifically to
do with his
approach, by maybe, I don't
know, talking

19:41.180 --> 19:43.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about issues?

19:43.049 --> 19:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: The issues are
different in each
part of the race, and obviously
the Republicans

19:46.352 --> 19:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now are trying to really
outdo each
other with warnings about the
threats facing

19:51.490 --> 19:53.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

19:53.292 --> 19:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to be consuming the
Republican
electorate right now. I mean,
concerns about

19:56.796 --> 20:01.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ISIS and terrorism have
overtaken, we have
found, concerns about taxes and
health care

20:01.100 --> 20:05.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the polls. So, whereas
Obamacare looked
like it was going to be a
driving issue, right

20:05.137 --> 20:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, that's not something that
gets as much
attention, at least not on the
air.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Who does that
benefit and who
does that hurt so far, at least
in fund-raising?

20:11.677 --> 20:16.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Well, in
fund-raising, we're going
to see at the end of this month,
but I think

20:16.182 --> 20:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz and Ben Carson have had
the most
success in their campaigns, and
Donald Trump

20:20.453 --> 20:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is doing the best in the polls.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, we will
see how it shakes
out when people actually start
to vote very

20:25.891 --> 20:26.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soon.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MATEA GOLD: Yes.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matea Gold of The
Washington Post,
thank you.

20:30.563 --> 20:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Always a pleasure.
Thanks.

20:36.302 --> 20:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

20:41.140 --> 20:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
doing for
others benefits you; lifelong
consequences

20:46.979 --> 20:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of segregated schools; and the
Netflix phenomenon
that takes true crime to a whole
new level.

20:53.552 --> 20:58.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, in issuing
guidelines for how
we should eat for the first time
in five years,

20:58.824 --> 21:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the federal government revises
some of its
longstanding advice.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Despite all
the warnings
over the years, you may be
surprised that,

21:08.067 --> 21:12.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the first time, the
government put a limit
on added sugar, saying it should
comprise

21:12.505 --> 21:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no more than 10 percent of your
daily calories.

21:16.008 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guidelines also dropped
prior advice about
limiting or avoiding cholesterol
and eggs.

21:21.347 --> 21:25.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government warned about
eating too much
protein or red meat, but stopped
short of

21:25.651 --> 21:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what some experts wanted. And it
said moderate
drinking of alcohol or coffee is
OK.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help guide us through some of
these guidelines,
their impact and the
controversy, I'm joined

21:35.294 --> 21:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Allison Aubrey, food and
health correspondent
for NPR.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Allison, let's start with
sugar first.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY, NPR: Sure.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What is the
right amount
of sugar? And put it in terms I
can understand.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALLISON AUBREY: Sure.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, basically, the dietary
guidelines are
coming out and saying you should
get no more

21:50.509 --> 21:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 10 percent of your calories
per day from
sugar, and that translates to
about 10 to

21:56.248 --> 22:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
12-teaspoons per day. Now, keep
in mind, this
adds up really, really quickly.
It translates

22:03.088 --> 22:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to about maybe 40 grams of
sugar. That's the
unit of measurement that people
are used to

22:07.526 --> 22:09.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seeing on labels.

22:09.395 --> 22:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, this morning,
I had a yogurt
for breakfast that had about 20
grams of sugar.

22:14.767 --> 22:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had one sort of sugary drink
or one muffin,
you're at your daily limit. And
basically,

22:20.906 --> 22:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, Americans are eating
about twice
as much. We have reported on
studies that

22:25.878 --> 22:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show that many Americans are
eating 22 teaspoons
a day.

22:29.982 --> 22:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if people are going to start
following
these recommendations, it really
means cutting

22:34.220 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consumption of sugar in half.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
maybe that will
help keep my New Year's
resolution going.

22:38.724 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's also talk about the
change, it seems,
about eggs and cholesterol. Why
the change?

22:43.896 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, it's been
sort of evolving
nutrition science, I would say.

22:48.567 --> 22:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There used to be a belief that
if you were
to eat a lot of cholesterol-rich
foods, so

22:55.274 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
animal-based foods with
cholesterol, think
of eggs or shrimp, that that
high cholesterol

23:01.213 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would lead to high LDL
cholesterol in your
bloodstream.

23:05.918 --> 23:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is still clearly a
concern about
elevated cholesterol in
bloodstream. That's

23:10.289 --> 23:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why many, many Americans are on
statins. But
it's now recognized that
high-cholesterol

23:15.561 --> 23:20.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
foods don't necessarily
translate into higher
cholesterol in our blood.

23:20.566 --> 23:25.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So the
guidelines didn't
say eat less red meat. It said
go ahead and

23:25.704 --> 23:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supplement with more seafood and
other things.
Why?

23:28.607 --> 23:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, I think
what the goal
is that one of the committee
members told

23:34.380 --> 23:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me that Americans don't want to
be told what
not to eat, what to avoid. They
want to be

23:39.918 --> 23:44.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told what they -- how to expand
their diet
or add more variety.

23:44.490 --> 23:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the words of the dietary
guidelines
and the people supporting
communication about

23:50.596 --> 23:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the new guidelines, the word
they're using
is shift. The idea is to shift
away from meat

23:57.336 --> 24:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and try alternative sources of
protein, so
anything from seafood to nuts to
beans.

24:02.441 --> 24:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, implicitly, that might mean
eating less
red meat, if you're eating more
of these other

24:07.413 --> 24:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sources of protein. It's a
little bit controversial.
The committee that helped advise
the administration

24:15.421 --> 24:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what should be in these
guidelines came
out last year and said, hey, we
think you

24:19.925 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should tell Americans to eat
less red meat.
But, in the end, that's not
what's in their

24:25.097 --> 24:26.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dietary guidelines.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what are
nutritionists
or experts in this think as
well?

24:29.535 --> 24:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, there is
some criticism,
I have to say, today.

24:32.371 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have spoken to several top
nutrition researchers
who say a limit on red meat
really should

24:40.279 --> 24:45.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have been put into the
guidelines. Otherwise,
Americans might just be confused
by this message

24:45.150 --> 24:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about shifting. And I think the
range of opinion
goes something like this.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people say, well, if you
are nudging
Americans to eat a little bit
less, that's

24:54.927 --> 25:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough. The other point of view
is Americans
need to be told like, hey, there
is too much

25:01.700 --> 25:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
red meat in your diet. They need
a specific
limit, but, again, that's not
there.

25:07.072 --> 25:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The fact that
these guidelines
come out only once every five
years, it almost

25:11.610 --> 25:18.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes it a political document.
It's a statement
by an administration on what
they think the

25:18.250 --> 25:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government thinks people should
or shouldn't
eat, right?

25:20.552 --> 25:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, I don't
see it so much
as a political document, as I
see it as kind

25:26.458 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a consensus report.

25:28.293 --> 25:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lag factor here. You
pointed out
in the beginning that just now
do we have

25:32.498 --> 25:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recommendation to limit sugar.
Your grandmother
could have told you that too
much sugar is

25:36.335 --> 25:40.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad for you. And what you have
to understand
is that the way this process
works is that,

25:40.906 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every five years, the Department
of Health
and Human Services and the U.S.
Department

25:44.943 --> 25:50.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Agriculture assign this
expert committee
to review all the new evidence.

25:50.649 --> 25:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pore over all of the
nutrition science
and they try to come up with a
consensus.

25:55.721 --> 26:00.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, five years
ago, we knew
that sugar would rot your teeth,
but we didn't

26:00.692 --> 26:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that 22 teaspoons of sugar
a day would
lead to an increased risk of
heart disease

26:05.297 --> 26:07.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or diabetes.

26:07.099 --> 26:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it takes a while for a
body of evidence
to lead scientists to say, aha,
we need a

26:13.806 --> 26:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear recommendation here, so a
bit of a lag
time.

26:16.975 --> 26:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Allison Aubrey
of NPR, thanks so much for
joining us.

26:26.018 --> 26:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Thanks for
having me.

26:31.890 --> 26:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: the power of
altruism, not
just for those on the receiving
end, but also

26:39.097 --> 26:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how it provides physical and
emotional benefits
for the giver.

26:43.502 --> 26:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman takes
a look, part of our weekly
segment Making

26:48.106 --> 26:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sense, which airs every Thursday
on the "NewsHour."

26:50.476 --> 26:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I want you to meet my
friend Monkey.
Hello. Do you want to say hello?

26:55.314 --> 26:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It is better to
give than to
receive. You may have heard it
when you were

26:59.751 --> 27:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this age, or even in the
past few weeks,
when you bought out the entire
Christmas list.

27:05.290 --> 27:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Look, Monkey has a bowl
just like you.
You don't have any treats and
neither does

27:12.264 --> 27:14.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Monkey.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But better for
whom? A behavioral
economics experiment has come up
with a provocative

27:17.669 --> 27:18.604 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
answer.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm going to give them
all to you.

27:20.906 --> 27:25.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Psychology
professor Elizabeth
Dunn designed this test to see
if even very

27:25.777 --> 27:28.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young kids could be happier
giving than receiving.

27:29.014 --> 27:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN, University of
British Columbia:
We worked with kind of the
toddler equivalent

27:31.383 --> 27:36.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of gold, namely goldfish
crackers. We gave
them a bunch goldfish for
themselves, and

27:36.455 --> 27:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then we gave them the chance to
give some
of these goldfish away to a
puppet named Monkey.

27:41.026 --> 27:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Will you give one to
Monkey? Yes?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Yes.

27:50.636 --> 27:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Dunn recorded
dozens of kids
doing this, then had students
who knew nothing

27:56.475 --> 28:02.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the experiment compare the
facial expressions
when receiving and when giving.
When were

28:02.481 --> 28:04.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the kids happiest?

28:04.349 --> 28:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: What we see is
that the toddlers
are happier when they're getting
the chance

28:07.252 --> 28:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give the goldfish away, as
compared to
when they're getting the
goldfish for themselves.

28:11.423 --> 28:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Much happier. So,
it's no surprise
that, with fellow happiness
scholar Michael

28:16.061 --> 28:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norton, Dunn has written a book:
"Happy Money:
The Science of Happier
Spending."

28:21.800 --> 28:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It features five key takeaways.

28:23.635 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: Well, if you
want to use money
to buy happiness, we suggest you
should buy

28:27.706 --> 28:33.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiences, you should buy
time, you should
make it a treat, you should pay
now and consume

28:34.012 --> 28:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
later, and you should invest in
others.

28:35.948 --> 28:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Invest in others,
the most surprising
finding of the five and one
which regularly

28:41.887 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
elicits skepticism, says
business school professor
Michael Norton.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL NORTON, Harvard
University: A lot
of people, when we talk about
the fact that

28:47.659 --> 28:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving makes you happy and
you're better off
giving than spending your money
on yourself,

28:52.464 --> 28:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will argue back, first off, that
we're crazy,
and, secondly, that that can't
be true, because

28:56.735 --> 29:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't really know what you
like, but I definitely
know what I like. And so, just
by definition,

29:02.374 --> 29:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm better at spending my money
on myself
and getting happiness than you,
because I

29:05.978 --> 29:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't know everything about you.

29:07.379 --> 29:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Can panda have one? Yes.
Can one go
in his bowl?

29:11.516 --> 29:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL NORTON: It's just not
what we see
in this study. So, even with
these toddlers,

29:14.720 --> 29:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are 2 years old, even if
it's the case
that their parents are making
them give in

29:18.624 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
order to be a nice person,
they're smiling.

29:21.493 --> 29:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And smiling is something that
just comes out.
It's not something that you can
control very

29:25.297 --> 29:27.065 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's not just
toddlers. Dunn
also designed an experiment for
grownups.

29:30.002 --> 29:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: We went out on
our campus
at the University of British
Columbia and

29:33.505 --> 29:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just walked up to people in the
morning and
handed them either a $5 or a $5
bill, which

29:37.576 --> 29:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we asked them to spend by the
end of the day.
And there was a catch. We told
some people

29:40.979 --> 29:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had to spend the money on
themselves.
We told some people they had to
spend the

29:43.915 --> 29:45.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money on somebody else.

29:45.851 --> 29:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we found was that
people who'd been
randomly assigned to spend this
money on somebody

29:49.321 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else felt better by the end of
the day than
people who'd been assigned to
spend that same

29:52.658 --> 29:54.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
small amount of money on
themselves.

29:54.493 --> 30:00.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A small experiment,
small money,
small number of subjects. And
Canadians are

30:00.198 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unusually nice, eh?

30:01.933 --> 30:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: So, we conducted
parallel
experiments in Canada, Uganda,
South Africa,

30:07.639 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as well as collecting
correlational data from
around the world. And what we
saw was that

30:12.678 --> 30:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in poor and rich countries
alike, people felt
happier when they had the chance
to spend

30:16.548 --> 30:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money on others rather than
themselves.

30:18.483 --> 30:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Best of all,
though, is the chance
to spend it on others you can
actually see.

30:22.754 --> 30:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL NORTON: So, a lot of the
charitable
giving that a lot of us do, we
write a check

30:26.058 --> 30:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it goes somewhere. And we
can show that
that does make you happier, but
think of the

30:30.362 --> 30:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difference between the check
goes into the
ether and you don't know what
happened with

30:33.932 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money, compared to you
really tangibly
see the impact that your money
had on another

30:38.770 --> 30:40.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
person.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or even just the
imaginary effect
on a stuffie.

30:41.707 --> 30:45.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Can you give one to
giraffe?

30:45.277 --> 30:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But are all kids
equally altruistic?
Is there a normal distribution,
a kind of

30:51.817 --> 30:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bell curve, some give a lot and
are really
happy, some are not happy at
all, most in

30:57.522 --> 30:59.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the middle?

30:59.424 --> 31:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: It's actually
surprisingly
consistent. So, most of the
toddlers are happier

31:02.661 --> 31:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they're giving than when
they're getting
the treats for themselves.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So what's that red
spot on the
brain?

31:08.166 --> 31:10.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH, Georgetown
University: So,
the red mark in the brain is an
area of functional

31:10.936 --> 31:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activation in the region called
the amygdala.

31:13.138 --> 31:17.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Georgetown
University psychology
Professor Abigail Marsh measures
the brain

31:17.843 --> 31:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity of what she terms
extraordinary altruists,
people who donated a kidney to a
total stranger.

31:24.716 --> 31:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: The amygdala is
part of what's
called the mammalian brain. It's
involved

31:29.221 --> 31:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with emotions like fear and it's
involved
in social processes, like, to
some extent,

31:35.660 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
love and caring. This is an
image from a brain
scan that we did looking at
differences in

31:41.867 --> 31:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amygdala activation in people
who had donated
a kidney to a stranger relative
to people

31:47.105 --> 31:49.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who have not.

31:49.107 --> 31:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Her research, she
says, was unequivocal:
The altruistic amygdalas were
about 8 percent

31:54.079 --> 31:55.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
larger than normal.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Altruistic kidney
donors showed
increased activation in the
amygdala when

31:59.718 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they saw somebody in distress,
which is the
opposite of people at the other
end of the

32:05.323 --> 32:09.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
compassion spectrum,
psychopaths, who show
reduced activation in the
amygdala when they

32:09.694 --> 32:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see somebody in distress.

32:10.829 --> 32:13.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And in one study of
psychopaths'
brains:

32:13.999 --> 32:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Their amygdalas
were shown
to be 17 to 18 percent smaller
than that of

32:18.703 --> 32:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controls, so this also seems to
be related
to having lower levels of
concern or compassion

32:24.843 --> 32:26.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for other people.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Dr. Seuss was
right. The
Grinch's heart is really three
sizes too small?

32:28.713 --> 32:32.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Yes, I do use
that analogy
sometimes. In fact, maybe it was
his amygdala

32:32.484 --> 32:34.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that was too small.

32:34.252 --> 32:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So when people find
that giving
is more gratifying than
receiving, what's

32:37.322 --> 32:39.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on?

32:39.124 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABIGAIL MARSH: Everything I
think we have
learned from our research is
consistent with

32:41.193 --> 32:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea that it is a good thing
and beneficial
for a person to be giving and
generous to

32:47.833 --> 32:49.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other people.

32:49.167 --> 32:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Do you want to give the
last treat
to you or to Monkey?

32:53.305 --> 33:00.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: One last
experiment: the effect
of giving on blood pressure.
Professor Dunn

33:00.512 --> 33:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gave adults over 65 with high
blood pressure
pill bottles filled with money.

33:06.151 --> 33:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: We asked them to
take home
these pill bottles and open them
on specified

33:11.323 --> 33:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days over the course of three
weeks. Now,
inside each bottle was actually
$20. And if

33:17.162 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look at the label, there are
some instructions
about what you should be doing
with that money.

33:20.699 --> 33:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Please spend this
money on someone
else by 4:30 p.m. at the date
listed below.

33:26.805 --> 33:32.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: Other people got
pill bottles
that looked very similar, except
the instruction

33:32.043 --> 33:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a little bit different.

33:33.111 --> 33:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Please spend this
money on yourself.

33:34.913 --> 33:39.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH DUNN: So, everybody
was pretty happy
getting pill bottles filled with
money. But

33:39.384 --> 33:44.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we measured their blood
pressure, both
before and after the study, what
we found

33:44.222 --> 33:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that people who got these
pill bottles
telling them to spend the money
on somebody

33:48.260 --> 33:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else showed a significant
reduction in their
blood pressure from the
beginning to the end

33:52.898 --> 33:54.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the study.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, people who got this
pill bottle
who were told to spend the money
on themselves

33:57.802 --> 34:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just showed no change from the
beginning to
the end.

34:00.138 --> 34:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, Dunn insists
we issue this
warning. No matter how generous
the hypertense

34:04.976 --> 34:09.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among you become after watching
this story,
please do not give up your blood
pressure

34:09.648 --> 34:11.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
medication just yet.

34:11.983 --> 34:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you want a quick ticket
to happiness,
it seems, whether your stash is
in gold or

34:17.155 --> 34:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goldfish, give it away. You will
be happy
you did.

34:20.191 --> 34:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Washington, D.C., and
Boston, this is
economics correspondent Paul
Solman, happily

34:24.796 --> 34:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sharing this news with you, the
"PBS NewsHour"
audience.

34:35.006 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As the Supreme Court
considers
yet another major affirmative
action case,

34:45.617 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tonight's Race Matters
conversation focuses
on what happens before students
get to college

34:50.956 --> 34:55.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they grow up in mostly
segregated inner-city
schools.

34:55.126 --> 35:01.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"PBS NewsHour" special
correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault is reporting a
year-long series

35:01.132 --> 35:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on solutions to the questions
raised by race.

35:04.636 --> 35:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she talks with Pedro
Noguera, a professor
at the University of California,
Los Angeles,

35:09.607 --> 35:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who has found what can work.

35:12.177 --> 35:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Despite
an historic
Supreme Court ruling some 61
years ago outlawing

35:17.515 --> 35:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
segregated schools, today, huge
numbers of
students remain in separate and
unequal schools,

35:23.254 --> 35:25.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most in inner cities.

35:25.056 --> 35:29.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it doesn't have to be that
way, says Pedro
Noguera, director of the Center
for Study

35:29.260 --> 35:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of School Transformation at
UCLA. I met him
in New York, where he was about
to speak with

35:34.399 --> 35:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a group of educators.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Noguera, thank you so
much for joining
us.

35:39.004 --> 35:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sixty-one years after separate
and unequal
was ruled illegal, you say it's
still happening.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

35:46.211 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA, University of
California, Los
Angeles: Well, it's happening
because the

35:47.912 --> 35:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts have basically made it
very difficult
to continue to pursue
integration.

35:52.283 --> 35:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's after we made quite a
bit of progress
in this country, especially in
the South,

35:56.388 --> 35:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but now we know that schools in
the North
and the West are more segregated
now than

36:00.025 --> 36:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were 30 years ago. So, we
now find ourselves
in a situation where not only
are schools

36:05.096 --> 36:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasingly racially separate,
but we're
also concentrating the poorest
children in

36:10.602 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools that have the fewest
resources.

36:12.303 --> 36:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Why?

36:14.105 --> 36:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: I would say it's
a combination
of lack of investment in schools
that serve

36:18.243 --> 36:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor children and the fact that
we have no
longer the political will.

36:22.781 --> 36:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But you
have argued
that separate schools play a
role in perpetuating

36:29.954 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inequality, not just in the
schools, but in
general.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PEDRO NOGUERA: They do.

36:34.726 --> 36:40.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do, because separate has
still been unequal
in education. The racially
separate schools,

36:40.899 --> 36:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even when the schools do a good
job, the learning
opportunities you have a child
will influence

36:45.303 --> 36:49.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of college you go into,
the kind
of profession you have access
to, the kind

36:49.674 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of income you earn.

36:51.643 --> 36:56.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so if we really are
interested in creating
a society that's more equal and
less characterized

36:56.214 --> 37:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by racial divisions, then we
need to put more
investment in education and
leveling the playing

37:01.086 --> 37:02.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
field and integrating our
schools.

37:02.954 --> 37:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: There
have been schools
that have started that are
supposed to be

37:06.691 --> 37:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making up for these disparities,
like the
charter schools and magnet
schools.

37:11.229 --> 37:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What impact are those kinds of
schools having,
though, on public education?

37:15.500 --> 37:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Well, in fact,
many of the
charter schools are even more
segregated than

37:19.437 --> 37:21.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the public schools.

37:21.306 --> 37:24.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Middle-class families,
particularly middle-class
African-American families, want
integrated

37:24.542 --> 37:26.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
schools for their kids.

37:26.377 --> 37:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Not long
ago, Professor
Raj Chetty told me about an
experiment that

37:30.748 --> 37:36.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
took young people out of
segregated communities
into more integrated
communities. But even

37:36.121 --> 37:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said that, while those were
successful,
you needed to fix those within
the community.

37:41.226 --> 37:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you have some solutions and
some examples
where that works.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Yes, and --
because we do have
examples.

37:47.765 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tulsa, Oklahoma, for example,
here, you have
a city, a very red state, the
best high school

37:54.339 --> 37:59.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the city, Booker T.
Washington, is 50 percent
black, and it is a school that
the entire

37:59.043 --> 38:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city looks up to. That should be
a model for
the country.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But why
is it a school
that everybody looks up to?

38:05.483 --> 38:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Because of the
quality of education
provided.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You just
said that
there wasn't the will in these
communities.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what happens in that case?

38:13.358 --> 38:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Well, Tulsa --
it's interesting,
because Tulsa has a very ugly
history. In

38:16.227 --> 38:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1924, there was the race riots
there, where
the black community was burned
to the ground,

38:20.064 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Greenwood.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been an effort,
though, in Tulsa
to invest in early childhood
education. Every

38:25.737 --> 38:30.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
child gets quality early
childhood education.
Every school is a community
school.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How did
it get to
that point?

38:32.410 --> 38:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Good question.

38:34.245 --> 38:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Hope Franklin, a great
historian, was
a leader in the effort in
promoting the idea

38:38.583 --> 38:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of reparations for black folks
in Tulsa. After
he died, his students...

38:42.654 --> 38:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: He was a
pre-Ta-Nehisi
Coates?

38:44.355 --> 38:44.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:45.023 --> 38:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: That's right.

38:46.758 --> 38:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his students, white students
from Duke
University, took up the effort
to rebuild

38:52.697 --> 38:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greenwood after he died. There
is a big monument
in Tulsa to John Hope Franklin
built by his

38:57.535 --> 39:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former students, most of whom
are affluent
whites in Tulsa.

39:01.773 --> 39:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is an important part of
the history
too. It's, we make our greatest
advances when

39:06.411 --> 39:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not just African-Americans
that are pushing
the issue, when whites, when
Latinos, when

39:11.649 --> 39:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asians, when the mosaic of
America recognizes
that we can be a better nation
if we are working

39:17.722 --> 39:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together, if we are serving each
other's interests.

39:19.657 --> 39:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, there are others
like it in
other parts of the country that
are showing

39:23.228 --> 39:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us that you don't have to wait
until we solve
the problem of poverty or
inequality. You

39:29.434 --> 39:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can do a lot in education now
that would help
to move our society forward.

39:32.770 --> 39:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But one
of the things
you have talked about is how
there are needs

39:37.342 --> 39:42.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond just the basic education,
particularly
for urban students, and I guess
you mean predominantly

39:42.747 --> 39:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American or children of
color.

39:44.515 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Well, absolutely.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many children in this
country -- because
we have the highest child
poverty rates of

39:48.987 --> 39:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all advanced nations; 22 percent
of kids in
this country come from families
at or below

39:53.791 --> 39:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the poverty level. So, we have a
lot of kids
coming to school who are hungry,
who don't

39:57.228 --> 40:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have adequate housing, whose
have basic needs
not being met.

40:01.099 --> 40:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schools serving those children
need other
resources. They need social
workers. They

40:04.669 --> 40:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need psychologists. They might
need a food
program. They might need health
workers on

40:09.173 --> 40:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site in order for those kids to
be able to
concentrate on education and for
their teachers

40:13.911 --> 40:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to concentrate on teaching them.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Brockton, Massachusetts,
you gave an example.

40:17.448 --> 40:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: What Brockton
shows us -- it's
the largest high school in the
state, 4,200

40:20.852 --> 40:26.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students -- that by focusing on
the student
needs, you can, even without
moving them,

40:26.758 --> 40:29.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
create a school that's the pride
of the community.

40:29.127 --> 40:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brockton is one of the only
urban high schools
in the state of Massachusetts
that gets a

40:33.665 --> 40:39.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level one rating. And that's
because over
one-third of their senior class
gets the highest

40:39.137 --> 40:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible test score in the
state. And the
demographics of the kids who get
that score

40:44.108 --> 40:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
match the demographics of the
school.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And how
did it get
that way?

40:46.878 --> 40:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: They focus on
literacy.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: They
who?

40:50.148 --> 40:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: The school. They
make sure
that every teacher, regardless
of the subject

40:53.151 --> 40:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they teach, is a teacher of
literacy, whether
it be science, or math, or art,
or music.

40:57.722 --> 41:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Literacy is what's promoted,
because they
understand that strong literacy
skills, reading,

41:02.527 --> 41:05.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing, speaking, is the key to
a strong
education.

41:05.263 --> 41:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have stuck with that
for the last
15 years or more. And it shows
in the results.

41:11.002 --> 41:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How
committed do you
think America is to maintaining
public education?

41:17.475 --> 41:20.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: I think we're at
a crossroads.

41:20.445 --> 41:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I try to remind people the
public education
system is the only system that
accepts all

41:25.416 --> 41:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children. If we don't educate
our children
well, we're all in trouble. The
retirees -- and

41:29.220 --> 41:33.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a growing number of
retirees in America,
most of whom are white -- are
going to be

41:33.458 --> 41:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasingly dependent on a
younger, more
diverse work force to support
them in their

41:38.162 --> 41:39.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retirement.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even if they really care
about the kids,
if they just care about
themselves, they should

41:42.233 --> 41:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be concerned about the future of
public education.
People who are concerned about
their property

41:45.636 --> 41:49.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
values should be concerned about
public education,
because the quality of the
schools affects

41:49.807 --> 41:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the value of your property.

41:51.542 --> 41:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're all in this together.
And that's
what it takes, is, we need
leadership that

41:55.480 --> 42:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets people to see it's in our
interests as
a country to invest in our
children, to invest

42:00.518 --> 42:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our schools. And we haven't
had that for
many years.

42:02.987 --> 42:04.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Except
in the places
you mentioned.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Yes. At the local
level you,
see it.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, it's
doable?

42:08.092 --> 42:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: It's doable. It
is absolutely
doable.

42:09.327 --> 42:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And
you're optimistic?

42:10.595 --> 42:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Cautiously
optimistic.

42:13.297 --> 42:18.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Professor Noguera,
thank you for joining us.

42:18.102 --> 42:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Thank you,
Charlayne.

GWEN IFILL: Netflix has
announced its video
streaming service will soon be
available globally,

42:37.655 --> 42:41.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading to a wider audience for
its movies
and original programming.

42:41.893 --> 42:47.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no bigger hit on
Netflix right now
than "Making a Murderer," the
story of a brutal

42:47.532 --> 42:52.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case in Wisconsin that raises
troubling questions
about our criminal justice
system.

42:52.703 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

42:55.006 --> 42:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a warning: If you have not
seen the series,
like me, there are some spoilers
ahead.

42:59.777 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Making a
Murderer" is the
new blockbuster true crime
series on Netflix.

43:05.082 --> 43:10.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 10 hour-long episodes,
filmmakers Laura
Ricciardi and Moira Demos tell
the story of

43:10.922 --> 43:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steven Avery, a Wisconsin man
who spent 18
years locked up for a sexual
assault he didn't

43:16.761 --> 43:18.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
commit.

43:18.563 --> 43:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, after his release, Avery
was arrested
for a new crime, the gruesome
murder of a

43:22.667 --> 43:24.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young photographer named Teresa
Halbach.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVEN AVERY, Suspect: I didn't
do it.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Who did it?

43:27.038 --> 43:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN AVERY: I don't know.

43:29.006 --> 43:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The series
documents, in
incredible detail, the
investigation and prosecution

43:33.244 --> 43:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Avery, and his young nephew,
Brendan Dassey.
Both men were found guilty, are
now serving

43:38.616 --> 43:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life sentences for Halbach's
death.

43:41.419 --> 43:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The series raises some troubling
questions
about how investigators and
prosecutors pursued

43:45.923 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the case. For example, was
then-16-year-old
Brendan Dassey coerced into
making a false

43:51.028 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
confession?

43:51.729 --> 43:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Who shot her in the head?

43:52.930 --> 43:55.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRENDAN DASSEY, Suspect: He did.

43:55.132 --> 44:01.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Was crucial
evidence linking
Avery to the crime in fact
planted by police?

44:01.239 --> 44:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And were police trying to frame
him because
Avery was suing them for $36
million over

44:06.744 --> 44:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his earlier wrongful conviction
in the sexual
assault case?

44:10.948 --> 44:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Making a Murderer" was released
in its entirety
just before Christmas, and it's
quickly become

44:17.788 --> 44:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a runaway success for Netflix.
Tens of thousands
of viewers are so convinced of
Steven Avery's

44:23.561 --> 44:28.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Brendan Dassey's innocence
that they have
signed online petitions to
President Obama

44:28.232 --> 44:32.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and to the governor of
Wisconsin, demanding
the men be pardoned immediately.

44:32.069 --> 44:36.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, I spoke with the
filmmakers, Ricciardi
and Demos, who spent 10 years
documenting

44:37.008 --> 44:38.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this story.

44:38.309 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what was it that first
attracted you two
to this story?

44:41.045 --> 44:45.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOIRA DEMOS, Filmmaker, "Making
a Murderer":
Here was a man who had been
clearly failed

44:45.216 --> 44:51.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by our justice system in the
mid-'80s, and
here he was now thrown back into
the system,

44:51.088 --> 44:55.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we were in a position where
we could follow
that case as it unfolded.

44:55.393 --> 45:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not really about the
question of, did
Steven do this or he did not do
this, but

45:01.165 --> 45:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really, can we trust, we can
rely on these
verdicts? And what we felt like
that offered

45:07.605 --> 45:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what Steven's experiences
offered us was
this amazing window into the
system.

45:12.677 --> 45:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The prosecutor
in this murder
case, Ken Kratz, has been on a
full-bore media

45:17.114 --> 45:22.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blitz recently, denouncing the
series, saying
it's extremely misleading, and
rejecting the

45:22.286 --> 45:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allegation that Steven Avery was
framed.

45:24.288 --> 45:29.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN KRATZ, Prosecutor: This
wasn't a documentary
at all. This was a defense
piece. It was generated

45:29.327 --> 45:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by and for Steven Avery by his
defense team.

45:34.031 --> 45:40.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If some of the evidence that was
selected,
I would call it handpicked or
cherry-picked,

45:40.104 --> 45:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over an 18-month period, didn't
fit with the
narrative, didn't fit with the
conclusion

45:45.376 --> 45:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Mr. Avery was the product
of a conspiracy
or some planted evidence, it's
my belief that

45:52.116 --> 45:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the filmmakers just wouldn't
include that
information.

45:55.953 --> 46:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kratz argues
that several
crucial pieces of evidence were
either glossed

46:00.758 --> 46:05.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over by the Netflix series or
left out altogether,
for example, the fact that
Steven Avery called

46:05.730 --> 46:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the murder victim several times
on the day
that she disappeared, or the
fact that Steven

46:10.067 --> 46:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Avery's own DNA showed up on the
victim's
car keys, on the hood of her
car, and inside

46:15.506 --> 46:17.274 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her car.

46:17.308 --> 46:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the prosecutor says that
you guys,
the filmmakers, didn't include
certain pieces

46:21.412 --> 46:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of evidence because -- quote --
"You didn't
want to muddy up a perfectly
good conspiracy

46:26.050 --> 46:27.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
movie with what actually
happened."

46:28.019 --> 46:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOIRA DEMOS: I guess I would say
he didn't
want to muddy up a perfectly
good prosecution

46:33.057 --> 46:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with what actually happened.

46:34.825 --> 46:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we included the evidence
that Kratz
himself spoke about in press
conferences as

46:42.099 --> 46:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being the most damning pieces of
evidence
of Avery's guilt, the most
significant physical

46:47.271 --> 46:54.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pieces evidence. We were
following his lead
of what to include. And, of
course, we couldn't

46:54.512 --> 46:57.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
include everything from a
six-week trial.

46:57.248 --> 47:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the things he is saying
are the proof
of Steven's guilt were not the
things he was

47:02.319 --> 47:04.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hanging his case on.

47:04.221 --> 47:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA RICCIARDI, Filmmaker,
"Making a Murderer":
Well, I have said before that we
had no horse

47:06.957 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this race. We -- whether
Steven Avery committed
the horrible crime with which he
was charged

47:14.365 --> 47:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not was of no consequence to
us as documentarians.

47:18.469 --> 47:23.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: "Making a
Murderer" is just
the latest in a recent line of
extremely popular

47:23.641 --> 47:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reexaminations of old criminal
cases.

47:26.577 --> 47:31.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, there was "Serial,"
the blockbuster
podcast that, in its first
season, scrutinized

47:31.549 --> 47:37.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the late '90s conviction of a
Maryland teenager
for the murder of his
ex-girlfriend, and HBO's

47:37.588 --> 47:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
popular miniseries "The Jinx,"
which looked
into the crimes of accused
murderer Robert

47:42.326 --> 47:44.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Durst.

47:44.161 --> 47:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your series obviously comes in a
long line
of these true crime cases of
late. And I wonder

47:49.467 --> 47:54.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why they are so, so popular with
their audiences.
Why do you think these stories
speak to us

47:54.572 --> 47:56.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so strongly?

47:56.507 --> 48:02.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOIRA DEMOS: I guess, not
always, but quite
often, true crime revolves a
marginal character,

48:02.580 --> 48:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an underdog, so to speak. And I
think most
people feel like underdogs in
their own lives.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they can attach to that
feeling.

48:13.157 --> 48:19.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, of course, this is
true crime. This
is real life. And there is
something very

48:19.697 --> 48:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immediate about that. The fact
that people
can do something with the
feelings they have

48:24.368 --> 48:29.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after they watch, I think, just
adds a layer
of intensity to it.

48:29.306 --> 48:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As for those
pardons, President
Obama can't do anything about
this, because

48:33.744 --> 48:36.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these weren't federal
convictions.

48:36.113 --> 48:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wisconsin's governor, Scott
Walker, could
do something, but he recently
threw cold water

48:39.950 --> 48:41.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the idea.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R),
Wisconsin: Just because

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For now,
Steven Avery remains

eligible for parole until 2048.

GWEN IFILL: Next, we turn to
Brief But Spectacular,
our occasional series where we
ask interesting

49:17.188 --> 49:19.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to discuss their
passions.

49:19.490 --> 49:24.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we hear from
illustrator and graphic
journalist Wendy Macnaughton,
who uses her

49:24.695 --> 49:27.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art to tell stories that might
otherwise be
overlooked.

49:27.331 --> 49:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY MACNAUGHTON, Illustrator
and Graphic
Journalist: So, you guys are
pointing this

49:29.934 --> 49:35.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camera in my face, but the great
thing is,
I don't have a camera, but I can
still capture

49:35.673 --> 49:45.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. So, don't -- don't move.
OK. Hold on.
Oh, you guys are going to hate
me for this.

49:45.716 --> 49:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. So, don't -- don't move.
OK. Hold on.
Oh, you guys are going to hate
me for this.

49:55.826 --> 50:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illustrated journalism is the
words that I
use to tell stories, real
stories using drawings

50:00.731 --> 50:04.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I do mostly from life, and
the words
of the people who I speak with.

50:04.835 --> 50:09.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, a lot of times,
with photography,
for example, if you will take a
camera and

50:09.506 --> 50:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will start documenting
people, right,
you will start like this --
like, you put

50:13.010 --> 50:15.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a camera in somebody's face,
then they might
feel a little objectified.

50:15.346 --> 50:21.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm not saying I do right
now. If you
have a sketchpad and you're
standing there

50:21.552 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you're drawing, instead of
people wondering,
like, what you're doing to them,
they're curious

50:26.790 --> 50:31.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what you're doing. So,
people will come
up to me. It actually opens up
doors, whereas

50:31.462 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other mediums might close them
down.

50:34.031 --> 50:40.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have done stories on the
corners of Fifth
and Sixth Street in San
Francisco, two streets

50:40.704 --> 50:45.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incredibly different right next
to each other.
On Fifth Street, you have a ton
of people

50:45.542 --> 50:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are shopping, who are going
to work, who
are working at tech companies.

50:48.712 --> 50:52.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you go over to Sixth
Street, and
you have people who have been
living there

50:52.383 --> 50:56.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for 20 years. It has got the
highest crime
rate in the city. It has one of
the highest

50:56.620 --> 51:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug use rates in the city
there. It's just
a really, really tough place to
be. I think

51:00.824 --> 51:06.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was a good metaphor for what
is going on
in San Francisco right now.

51:06.931 --> 51:13.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, my aunt died, and it
was the first
time that I had ever been really
bedside while

51:13.304 --> 51:17.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody was dying. Drawing for
me is a way
of looking at things. It's like
an excuse

51:17.775 --> 51:22.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at something that I
might otherwise
be afraid of. So, I started
drawing my aunt

51:22.313 --> 51:24.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyday.

51:24.148 --> 51:28.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The drawings turned out, I
think, beautiful.
And they're hard to look at, but
they're good

51:28.619 --> 51:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at. The same day she
died, I got a
call from this hospice
organization asking

51:34.091 --> 51:35.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if I would be the artist in
residence.

51:35.893 --> 51:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went into the hospice project
thinking that
I was going to do a story about
the people

51:41.298 --> 51:46.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were dying and it would be
focused on
the people who are dying, but
now I have drawn

51:46.270 --> 51:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for several months, and I can
tell it's not.
It's probably going to be more
about the volunteers,

51:51.942 --> 51:57.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the amazing volunteers who are
caring for
the people and their families.

51:57.648 --> 52:02.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm interested in the stories of
people who
don't get their stories told.

52:02.653 --> 52:08.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Wendy Macnaughton.
And this is
my Brief But Spectacular take on
illustrated

52:08.726 --> 52:10.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
documentary.

52:10.527 --> 52:17.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

And on our own Web site, in
addition to teaching
children how to behave in real
life, parents

52:25.843 --> 52:32.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
must now keep track of their
kids' behavior
online. A new survey shows
nearly all parents

52:32.116 --> 52:37.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have told their teen what's OK
to view and
share on social media. But
that's not the

52:37.321 --> 52:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only way they're keeping tabs.

And we turn again to our honor
roll of American
service personnel killed in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

52:50.334 --> 52:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We add them as their deaths are
made official
and photographs become
available. Here, in

52:55.639 --> 53:01.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
silence, is one more.

53:01.111 --> 53:05.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
