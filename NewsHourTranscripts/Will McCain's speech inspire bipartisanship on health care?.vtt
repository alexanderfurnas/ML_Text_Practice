JUDY WOODRUFF: As we heard, it
was a dramatic and consequential
return for John McCain to

00:05.033 --> 00:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Senate floor, his first
public appearance since being
diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:12.466 --> 00:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While his vote helped
Republicans open up
debate on health care,
he laid out the difficult

00:17.433 --> 00:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
road ahead to replace
the Affordable Care Act,
and he called on his
colleagues to change

00:22.200 --> 00:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tone and behavior of the
Senate more broadly as well.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona:
Our deliberations can
still be important and
useful, but I think

00:30.033 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we'd all agree they
haven't been overburdened
by greatness lately.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, right now, they
aren't producing much
for the American people.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Both sides have let this happen.

00:42.566 --> 00:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's leave the history of who
shot first to the historians.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suspect they will find we
all conspired in our decline,
either by deliberate actions

00:51.466 --> 00:52.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or neglect.

00:52.733 --> 00:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have all played
some role in it.

00:54.533 --> 00:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Certainly, I have.

00:55.833 --> 00:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sometimes, I have let my
passion rule my reason.

00:59.133 --> 01:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, I made it harder
to find common ground because
of something harsh I said to

01:04.733 --> 01:06.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a colleague.

01:06.766 --> 01:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, I wanted to win more
for the sake of winning than
to achieve a contested policy.

01:13.533 --> 01:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I hope we can again
rely on humility, on our
need to cooperate, on
our dependence on each

01:20.466 --> 01:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other to learn how to trust
each other again and by so doing
better serve the people who

01:24.433 --> 01:26.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elected us.

01:26.433 --> 01:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stop listening to the bombastic
loudmouths on the radio and
television and the Internet.

01:32.066 --> 01:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To hell with them.

01:33.866 --> 01:34.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34.866 --> 01:36.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:36.433 --> 01:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN MCCAIN: They don't
want anything done
for the public good.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's trust each other.

01:43.466 --> 01:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's return to regular order.

01:45.466 --> 01:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been spinning our
wheels on too many important
issues because we keep trying to

01:51.800 --> 01:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a way to win without
help from across the aisle.

01:54.333 --> 01:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's an approach that's
been employed by both sides,
mandating legislation from the

01:58.700 --> 02:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top down, without any support
from the other side, with all
the parliamentary maneuvers

02:04.300 --> 02:05.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that requires.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're getting nothing
done, my friends.

02:07.433 --> 02:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're getting nothing done.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all we have really done
this year is confirm Neil
Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

02:16.566 --> 02:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our health care insurance
system is a mess.

02:20.166 --> 02:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We all know it, those
who support Obamacare
and those who oppose it.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Something has to be done.

02:26.266 --> 02:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We Republicans have looked for
a way to end it and replace
it with something else without

02:30.533 --> 02:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paying a terrible
political price.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We haven't found it yet.

02:34.966 --> 02:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure we will.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All we have managed to do is
make more popular a policy that
wasn't very popular when we

02:41.766 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
started trying to get rid of it.

02:44.133 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
John McCain on the
Senate floor today.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We asked more than 20 Republican
senators to join us tonight.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
None accepted our invitation.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we stay on Capitol Hill
for a Democrat's perspective.

02:55.833 --> 02:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is Senator Jon
Tester of Montana.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He has served in the
Senate since 2007.

03:00.633 --> 03:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator, we're very glad
to have you join us.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did you make of what
John McCain had to say today?

03:07.100 --> 03:08.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON TESTER (D), Montana:
Well, I think he was spot on.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John's a statesman, and he
certainly has respects from
both sides of the aisle.

03:13.633 --> 03:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this place is broken.

03:16.066 --> 03:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we do need to work across
the aisle, and compromise
shouldn't be a dirty word.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to negotiate and
we need to take everybody's
input and come up with the best

03:26.233 --> 03:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible legislation.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's certainly not what
happened with the health care
bill that we have dealt with

03:32.166 --> 03:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the last seven months, the
various ones that have come out.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the bottom
line is this, Judy.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This country was built by
people working together.

03:39.466 --> 03:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington, D.C., is far,
far, far too partisan.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need to start
working together.

03:45.466 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think John McCain
is right on that.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any sign
that that's going to happen?

03:49.333 --> 03:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is one senator's speech
on the floor going
to make a difference?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JON TESTER: Well, no,
I think it's going to
take more than that.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will just tell you that
I am blessed to be able to
work with a guy by the name

03:58.266 --> 04:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Johnny Isakson
on the VA Committee.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And together, a Republican
and a Democrat, along with a
really good committee, have been

04:04.766 --> 04:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to pump out some pretty
good bills that the president
has been able to sign.

04:08.733 --> 04:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have done that by
communicating with one another,
not embarrassing one another,

04:13.700 --> 04:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but working for the best
interests of our veterans.

04:16.233 --> 04:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that if the Senate
would take a look at the
successes we have had over the

04:23.633 --> 04:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last many years, it's been
by people communicating
and working together and
negotiating and compromising.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think we start
to doing that more and
more in the Senate.

04:32.266 --> 04:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is no better place
to start than with a bill
that impacts one-sixth of our

04:36.533 --> 04:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economy, this health care bill.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about that health care bill.

04:40.100 --> 04:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now that Republicans have
been able to get it on the
floor, debate has begun.

04:44.033 --> 04:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they have the votes, do you
believe, to get it to a point
where they repeal the Affordable

04:50.466 --> 04:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Care Act and come up with a
substitute that they like?

04:52.300 --> 04:54.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:54.266 --> 04:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON TESTER: I have no idea,
because I don't know of anybody
that voted today that knew

04:56.800 --> 04:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they were voting on.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were voting on potentially
a House bill that was going
to be replaced with something

05:02.900 --> 05:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else, but we don't
know what it is.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will go back to
John McCain's words.

05:07.533 --> 05:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's go back to the
committee process and
start working together.

05:10.933 --> 05:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's going to have to be
something that Mitch McConnell
requires, rather than trying

05:15.800 --> 05:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to craft something with a
limited number of people and
a limited number of input that

05:22.733 --> 05:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually doesn't move the health
care system forward and make
it more accessible and more

05:24.633 --> 05:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affordable, especially for
folks in Middle America,
because we really get pounded by

05:29.366 --> 05:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
proposals like the House
bill or, what's even
worse, the Senate health
care bill that came

05:33.700 --> 05:35.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it could literally shut
down health care facilities.

05:37.733 --> 05:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what they have told
me as I have gone around the
state and visited face-to-face

05:41.900 --> 05:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these folks.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
what we're hearing now is what
-- the version that may have the

05:46.933 --> 05:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
best chance is what
they're calling skinny
repeal, which wouldn't
do away with everything,

05:53.366 --> 05:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it would do away with
the individual mandate.

05:55.433 --> 05:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would do away, I gather,
with employer mandate penalty
and the medical device tax.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something that comes
any closer to a consensus?

06:02.900 --> 06:04.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:04.966 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON TESTER: I don't know that
that's the kind of reform that
we need in our health care

06:07.500 --> 06:09.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

06:09.566 --> 06:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it may be more of
a bait-and-switch to be able to
get a bill that you could get

06:12.533 --> 06:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a number of votes to pass
it out and then take it to
conference and replace with it

06:16.033 --> 06:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a really bad bill.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's my concern.

06:19.300 --> 06:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you don't
think that that version, which
some Republicans are saying

06:25.233 --> 06:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would make them happy, bring
some conservatives on board, and
perhaps entice moderates, you're

06:29.966 --> 06:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying you don't see
that as moving the ball?

06:31.300 --> 06:32.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON TESTER: Look, I don't think
it's going the move the ball.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there is
another agenda here.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the agenda is to do some
really bad things with Medicaid
expansion and to block-grant

06:42.966 --> 06:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid, which really hurts
rural states - - I think it
hurts the whole country -- and

06:46.766 --> 06:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not to address preexisting
conditions and lifetime caps.

06:50.766 --> 06:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if that's the direction
we're headed, then that's not
the direction I want to go.

06:58.233 --> 07:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that skinny
bill, that bait-and-switch
bill, whatever you
want to call it, Trojan

07:00.633 --> 07:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
horse repeal bill, that bill
is not where we will end up at.

07:07.066 --> 07:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think you get the
conservatives with that bill.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think you
get the moderates either.

07:12.066 --> 07:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think what's
happened here is, you
have got Mitch McConnell,
who has his vote today

07:16.433 --> 07:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on something we don't know
what it is going to end up at,
and him crafting another bill

07:20.866 --> 07:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put it up to be able to
change the bill in conference.

07:23.633 --> 07:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's all very convoluted,
in the weeds, but that's
where we're headed.

07:27.133 --> 07:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Senator, you
mentioned Medicaid expansion
in your own state of Montana.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm reading an Associated Press
report that talks about the
number of Medicaid enrollees

07:37.233 --> 07:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having far exceeded the
number that were expected.

07:39.966 --> 07:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of people in
your state worrying this
program can't be sustained.

07:43.666 --> 07:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess they were expecting
maybe 30,000 to sign up.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been 80,000
who have signed up.

07:49.566 --> 07:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's worry that
Montana can't continue this.

07:52.466 --> 07:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Isn't this the exact sort
of thing that Republicans
say is what making this
whole process unsustainable?

07:57.933 --> 07:59.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:59.966 --> 08:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON TESTER: I think the
Medicaid expansion has been an
incredible success in Montana

08:02.533 --> 08:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and has really helped people
get health care for the first
time in their life, the working

08:07.266 --> 08:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
folks out there that couldn't
afford health care before.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think this is
about priorities.

08:12.733 --> 08:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if our priority is to make
sure that people have access
to affordable health care, then

08:20.300 --> 08:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we need to move forward.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we have got 77,000
folks that signed up for
Medicaid expansion in
the state of a million

08:26.200 --> 08:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and 50,000 people.

08:27.933 --> 08:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think that's
necessarily a bad thing.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's a good thing,
because now we have people
that are going to school that

08:33.333 --> 08:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are healthy, that are going to
work that are healthy, that own
small businesses that healthier,

08:39.466 --> 08:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I think it's an
important step to take.

08:40.866 --> 08:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think it's
about priorities.

08:44.033 --> 08:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to make health care
a priority in this country.

08:46.566 --> 08:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
