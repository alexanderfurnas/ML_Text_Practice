PHILADELPHIA.

00:07.607 --> 00:09.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DID THE DEFENSE TEAM DO IT?

00:09.576 --> 00:11.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE DEFENSE TEAM REALLY DID

00:11.311 --> 00:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT THROUGH CROSS-EXAMINATION.

00:13.713 --> 00:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY POUNDED ON THE

00:15.248 --> 00:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCONSISTENCIES IN ANDREA

00:17.484 --> 00:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTAND'S STATEMENTS THAT SHE

00:19.786 --> 00:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE TO POLICE, THE DATES THAT

00:21.921 --> 00:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE GOT WRONG AND THEN HAD TO

00:23.590 --> 00:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATER CORRECT.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE SCENARIOS THAT STARTED

00:26.893 --> 00:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT ONE WAY WHEN SHE TALKED TO

00:28.294 --> 00:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE AND ENDED UP ANOTHER.

00:30.096 --> 00:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS WAS ALSO

00:30.797 --> 00:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING IN THAT WHO WAS NOT

00:31.998 --> 00:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

00:32.465 --> 00:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILL COSBY DIDN'T TESTIFY IN

00:34.034 --> 00:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS OWN DEFENSE AND THERE ARE

00:35.301 --> 00:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCUSED

00:37.637 --> 00:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COSBY IN THE PAST THAT WERE IN

00:39.372 --> 00:41.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STANDS BUT DIDN'T TESTIFY.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE PROSECUTOR WANTED TO HAVE

00:43.109 --> 00:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
13 PREVIOUS ACCUSERS OF BILL

00:46.679 --> 00:48.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COSBY'S TO TAKE THE STAND IN

00:48.648 --> 00:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CASE.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD THE EFFECT

00:51.284 --> 00:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF REALLY FLOODING THE ZONE,

00:53.286 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELLING THE JURY THAT EVEN IF

00:55.155 --> 00:56.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:56.890 --> 00:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREA CONSTAND'S STATEMENTS,

00:58.858 --> 00:59.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE'S JUST SUCH AN

00:59.926 --> 01:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF OTHER

01:01.728 --> 01:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMEN THAT YOU JUST WOULD HAVE

01:04.030 --> 01:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BELIEVE HER.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTEAD, THE JUDGE ONLY ALLOWED

01:06.332 --> 01:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OTHER PREVIOUS ACCUSER.

01:08.368 --> 01:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT

01:09.836 --> 01:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT IN

01:11.704 --> 01:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVING THE UNCERTAINTY TO THE

01:13.873 --> 01:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JURY THAT LED THEM TO THIS

01:15.275 --> 01:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISTRIAL.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF COSBY'S

01:17.410 --> 01:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPOKESMEN CAME OUT KIND OF

01:18.978 --> 01:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUBILANTLY AND SAID HIS

01:20.246 --> 01:21.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUTATION IS BACK, BUT HE'S NOT

01:21.081 --> 01:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF THE WOODS YET.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, HE'S ABSOLUTELY NOT OUT

01:24.050 --> 01:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE WOODS.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROSECUTOR, KEVIN STEELE,

HESITATION SAID THAT HE'S GOING

01:32.759 --> 01:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RETRY THIS CASE.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I LOOKED OVER AT THE DEFENSE

01:36.496 --> 01:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TABLE.

01:37.063 --> 01:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS JUST A FEW STEPS AWAY, AND

01:39.165 --> 01:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S BILL COSBY BY HIMSELF,

01:41.401 --> 01:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HANDS ON HIS FACE, LOOKING DOWN

01:43.436 --> 01:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE GROUND.

01:44.237 --> 01:45.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THAT MOMENT, I THOUGHT THIS

01:45.572 --> 01:47.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A MAN WHO IS COMPLETELY

01:47.073 --> 01:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONE.

01:47.507 --> 01:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
