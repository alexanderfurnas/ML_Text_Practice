Republican Party
spokesman Sean Spicer and look
at how the

00:16.817 --> 00:19.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential bully pulpit is
being redefined.

Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian
Institution:

00:39.640 --> 00:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really shifted my perception
of what these
works are, and I'm hoping that
it will also

00:45.545 --> 00:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shift the perception of the
visitors who come
to the museum to see the
exhibition.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Donald Trump still made
headlines, as "TIME"

01:40.634 --> 01:44.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Branstad is a Republican and the
longest-serving
governor of Iowa ever.

01:44.838 --> 01:49.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of the most prominent
establishment
Republicans to support Mr. Trump
in the election,

01:49.609 --> 01:54.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he has a longstanding

as Mr. Trump's pick to lead the
Environmental

02:19.439 --> 02:22.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

DONALD TRUMP: Mad Dog Mattis.

02:25.112 --> 02:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this after
the incoming

rally last night

02:35.522 --> 02:37.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

02:37.791 --> 02:41.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattis would need a waiver from
Congress to
accept the position because he's
been out

02:41.261 --> 02:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the service less than seven
years.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What a great guy.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to be incredible.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He will get that waiver, right?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's going to get that.

02:47.868 --> 02:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oh, if he didn't get that
waiver, there would
be a lot of angry people.

02:53.673 --> 02:58.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The stop in
North Carolina
is part of a clear ramp-up of
travel for Mr.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

03:06.720 --> 03:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Friday, the stops are Baton
Rouge, Louisiana,
to support the Republican Senate
candidate

03:10.791 --> 03:15.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a runoff, and another thank
you rally in
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

03:15.395 --> 03:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump said today
he thinks
his biggest remaining pick,
secretary of state,

03:19.166 --> 03:20.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will come next week.

This morning, he also told "The

predecessor.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will say this.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have now gotten to know
President Obama.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I really like him.

03:30.677 --> 03:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We obviously very much disagree
on certain
policy and certain things, but I
really like

03:37.284 --> 03:38.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him as a person.

03:39.019 --> 03:42.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, today, Mr.
Trump met
with the president's first chief
of staff,

03:42.522 --> 03:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who
said he argued
for so-called dreamers,
undocumented Americans

03:47.727 --> 03:49.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
brought here as children.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

statements in the trial of
Dylann Roof, the
man charged with murdering nine
black churchgoers.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happened in June 2015.

04:04.544 --> 04:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, a federal prosecutor
declared Roof
had a cold and hateful heart.

04:09.850 --> 04:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The defense conceded Roof's
guilt, and focused
on preventing a death sentence.

04:14.221 --> 04:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, a survivor broke down as
she testified
about seeing her son die in the
gunfire.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Authorities in

04:23.196 --> 04:27.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deadly wildfire that roared
through the Great
Smoky Mountains two weeks ago.

04:27.167 --> 04:32.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

were damaged or destroyed as
high winds blew

04:32.606 --> 04:35.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the flames into the Gatlinburg
area.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prosecutors left open the
possibility that
others could be charged as well.

04:38.945 --> 04:43.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Recovery efforts
came to an
end today at the scene of the
deadly warehouse

04:43.216 --> 04:45.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fire in Oakland, California.

04:45.418 --> 04:49.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death toll from the weekend
tragedy stands
at 36.

04:49.322 --> 04:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators have turned their
attention
to a refrigerator as a possible
cause.

04:53.827 --> 04:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fast-moving fire ripped
through the warehouse,
where a dance party was under
way.

04:58.365 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Indonesia,
the earth
shook before dawn today,
knocking down buildings,

05:03.170 --> 05:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sending terrified people
into the streets.

05:05.539 --> 05:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least 97 were killed, with
hundreds more
injured.

05:10.844 --> 05:17.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a picture of desperation,
rescue crews
using bare hands to dig through
twisted wreckage,

05:17.417 --> 05:19.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while excavators removed heavier
debris.

05:19.953 --> 05:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
estimate the
number of casualties will
continue to rise,

05:24.958 --> 05:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as some of the residents are
still likely
under the rubble of the
buildings.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The search-and-rescue operation
is still under
way.

05:30.830 --> 05:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The quake hit
shortly after
5:00 a.m., registered 6.5, and
was centered

05:36.069 --> 05:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the northern tip of Aceh
province on
Sumatra Island.

05:39.639 --> 05:42.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was too shallow to
trigger a tsunami.

05:42.342 --> 05:48.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still, it was all too
reminiscent of the far
more powerful quake and tsunami
that devastated

05:48.248 --> 05:54.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same region in 2004, killing
more than
100,000 people in Aceh alone.

05:54.454 --> 05:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That disaster prompted efforts
to improve
warnings and readiness.

05:58.225 --> 06:02.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Kanupriya Kapoor with
Reuters said the
quake-prone country still has a
long way to

06:02.996 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She spoke to us via Skype from
Jakarta.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KANUPRIYA KAPOOR, Reuters: If I
were to speak
to the readiness of these
communities, the

06:09.302 --> 06:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preparedness to deal with a
quake, I wouldn't
be surprised if they aren't as
prepared, if,

06:14.674 --> 06:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, structures in this
area, you know,
were clearly not built to
withstand even a

06:20.914 --> 06:22.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
6.5-magnitude earthquake.

06:22.749 --> 06:28.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Indonesia's
disaster agency
estimates some 245 buildings,
including 14

06:28.288 --> 06:33.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosques, were either seriously
damaged or
destroyed in today's quake,
leaving thousands

06:33.493 --> 06:35.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people homeless.

06:35.328 --> 06:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Indonesian government has
officially declared
a two-week state of emergency in
Aceh.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In the mountains
of Northern
Pakistan, no one survived an
airplane crash

06:45.205 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

outside Islamabad.

Junaid Jamshed, a well-known

cal-Muslim-cleric,
was among those who perished.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The cause of the crash is under

HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S. and
five other
Western nations are calling for
a new cease-fire

07:11.164 --> 07:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Aleppo, Syria, in a bid to
get civilians
out.

07:14.634 --> 07:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also accused Russia today
of blocking
efforts to end the bloodshed.

07:18.838 --> 07:22.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Syrian government
troops and their
allies pushed deeper into
Eastern Aleppo.

07:22.342 --> 07:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They now control about 75

07:46.433 --> 07:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for a stepped-up campaign to
fight opioid
abuse.

07:49.269 --> 07:53.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Senators also
paid tribute
today to Vice President Biden.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served there for 36 years
representing
Delaware.

07:56.376 --> 08:00.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was back today in his

listening as lawmakers

08:00.980 --> 08:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
praised him for compassion,
strength and humor.

08:04.250 --> 08:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Maryland Senator Barbara
Mikulski gave
her farewell speech after
serving 30 years.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That makes her the longest
serving female
senator ever.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA MIKULSKI (D), Maryland:
Though I was
the first Democratic woman, I
wanted to be

08:15.729 --> 08:17.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the first of many.

08:17.497 --> 08:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wanted to help women get
elected to the
Senate and do what I could to be
able to help

08:24.170 --> 08:25.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them to do that.

08:25.939 --> 08:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been just wonderful to
see that now
there are over -- there are 20
women that

08:32.178 --> 08:35.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are currently serving in the
United States
Senate.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mikulski also
served 10
years in the House before coming
to the Senate.

08:39.018 --> 08:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street
soared today on
mounting expectations of faster
growth.

08:44.190 --> 08:49.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
reached another
record, gaining nearly 300
points to close

08:49.996 --> 08:52.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at 19549.

08:52.499 --> 08:58.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 60 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 29, for its own record
close.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And thousands
of people
converged on Pearl Harbor today,
marking 75

09:02.842 --> 09:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years since the Japanese attack
that brought
the United States into World War
II.

09:07.147 --> 09:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elderly survivors highlighted
the crowd that
gathered across the harbor from
where the

09:11.618 --> 09:13.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
battleship Arizona sank.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They observed a moment of
silence and then
listened to tributes to all
those killed on

09:17.123 --> 09:18.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
December 7, 1941.

09:18.992 --> 09:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the GOP's
Sean Spicer talks about Donald
Trump's latest

09:24.731 --> 09:30.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
appointments; the
president-elect's unconventional
methods of communicating
directly with the

09:30.036 --> 09:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American people; the first woman
to win baseball's
prestigious sportswriting award;
and much

09:39.179 --> 09:42.148 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

09:42.182 --> 09:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We get the view
from Trump
Tower now on the
president-elect's transition

09:52.025 --> 09:53.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Sean Spicer.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's spokesman for the
Republican National
Committee.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

09:58.898 --> 10:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me start with some of the
announcements
already made today just in the
last hour or

10:03.536 --> 10:05.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so.

10:05.438 --> 10:11.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Linda McMahon, with the
professional wrestling
organization, she and her
husband made a huge

10:11.444 --> 10:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
success of that, appointed to
run the Small
Business Administration.

10:16.416 --> 10:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This now makes, I think, the
fourth or fifth
billionaire appointed to the
Trump Cabinet.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of this?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are ordinary Americans to
make of this?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Communications
Director, Republican
National Committee: I think you
look at the

10:27.760 --> 10:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people, like Linda McMahon.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She started a company with 13
people.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She ended up with 800.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think Donald Trump has
shown is that
he wants to surround himself
with people who

10:36.069 --> 10:39.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are successful, who understand
how to make
change and make things happen.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans want more jobs.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want to put America first.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want American businesses,
they want American
families to be put first and
foremost.

10:45.478 --> 10:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what Donald Trump is
showing:
I'm going to get the best, most
qualified,

10:49.048 --> 10:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most successful people to be
part of a Trump-Pence
administration, because the one
thing that

10:53.987 --> 10:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has ended, Judy, is business as
usual in Washington,
D.C.

10:56.890 --> 11:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at someone like Linda
McMahon, who
not only built an unbelievably
successful

11:00.960 --> 11:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business, but then went on to
mentor young
women and others to help them
grow and flourish.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's what we want.

11:06.933 --> 11:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want people who have a track
record of
success to come into Washington,
to shake

11:12.305 --> 11:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things up, and get the country
back on track,
to get jobs moving, to fix a
health care system

11:17.577 --> 11:19.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that is not working.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all of those things that
people are talking
about that they want, he is
surrounding himself

11:21.948 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with successful people that are
going to get
the job done.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there is
another pick
being confirmed by news
organizations, not

11:27.420 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet by the Trump transition, and
that is to
run the Environmental Protection
Agency, the

11:32.492 --> 11:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EPA, Scott Pruitt, the attorney
general of
the state of Oklahoma.

11:37.063 --> 11:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The environmental community is
already up
in arms, reacting very
negatively to this,

11:41.134 --> 11:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying he is not only a climate
change denier,
that he's very, very close to
the fossil fuel

11:46.205 --> 11:47.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: OK, well, look,
here's what I
would argue.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, no announcement
has been made
on that position.

11:53.746 --> 11:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second of all, everybody that
comes into a
Trump-Pence administration, from
the lowest

11:57.417 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the highest person in the
administration,
is here to carry out Donald
Trump's vision

12:01.287 --> 12:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and agenda and to get the things
that he wants
done accomplished.

12:04.357 --> 12:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, regardless of what
somebody's
personal positions are, what
they're signing

12:09.295 --> 12:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on to is Donald Trump's vision,
his agenda,
his philosophy, and the things
that he wants

12:14.467 --> 12:16.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to succeed at.

12:16.402 --> 12:21.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
environmental community
shouldn't read this as somebody
who is -- doesn't

12:21.240 --> 12:26.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
believe in anything,
essentially, in their
agenda being put in charge of
the agency that's

12:26.479 --> 12:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supposed to look after the
environment?

12:28.314 --> 12:31.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, look, I think
that there's
a big difference between
environmentalists

12:31.784 --> 12:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the left and people who care
about the
environment.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that sounds like a
distinction,
but the reality is, is that, you
know, two

12:37.724 --> 12:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Donald Trump's kids, Eric and
Don Jr.,
are very avid hunters.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They understand and appreciate
the wilderness
and the outdoors.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They love to be out there.

12:46.065 --> 12:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that there's a big
difference
between appreciating and wanting
to preserve

12:49.535 --> 12:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and protect the environment,
something -- whether
it's clean water or clean air,
something that

12:53.406 --> 12:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we all cherish, or the agenda
pushed by the
far left.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there is a big difference.

12:58.077 --> 13:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that there's --
it is a very
big difference to care about
whether or not

13:03.016 --> 13:08.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're toting to the agenda of
the far extreme
left that is a job-killing,
regulation-type

13:08.287 --> 13:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agenda that wants to step out of
-- put businesses
out of business, or people who
actually care

13:13.359 --> 13:17.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the environment and whose
goal is clean
air, clean water, making sure
that we preserve

13:17.530 --> 13:19.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our natural resources and things
like that.

13:19.866 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other
appointments I want
to ask you about, one was
announced, the ambassador

13:23.503 --> 13:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to China, the governor of Iowa,
Terry Branstad.

13:28.474 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know Mr. Trump has stressed,
I think what
you have to say, is a get-tough
with China

13:33.079 --> 13:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach, is one way to describe
it.

13:35.782 --> 13:40.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And today, though, he is
emphasizing someone
who has a close personal
relationship with

13:40.887 --> 13:42.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the leader of China.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is he undermining the get-tough
message somehow
with this?

13:45.625 --> 13:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: No, I think what
Mr. Trump understands
is, he's been successful at
business through

13:51.397 --> 13:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
negotiation and relationship.

13:53.032 --> 13:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He understands how to get what
he wants, how
to advance a goal.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Terry Branstad brings
to it this,
he's the longest serving
governor in the United

14:00.640 --> 14:02.341 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has a huge, extensive
relationship with
the president of China,
something that he

14:05.111 --> 14:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can leverage to make sure that
it is not -- it
starts that relationship off on
a good foot,

14:10.316 --> 14:14.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to make sure that China
understands that we
have an agenda of putting
American workers

14:14.520 --> 14:15.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
first.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's going to be the agenda
here.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it allows that relationship
to start from
the beginning, as opposed to
having a get-to-know-you

14:20.860 --> 14:22.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phase.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have a long, extensive
relationship,
and that's going to benefit the
United States

14:24.997 --> 14:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to advance the Donald Trump
agenda and make
sure that America gets back some
of that -- some

14:29.335 --> 14:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those jobs and some of that
manufacturing
that has gone to China.

14:31.938 --> 14:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
another appointment,
or potential appointment I want
to ask about

14:36.075 --> 14:39.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- again, news organizations
have this -- and
that is retired General John
Kelly to run

14:40.012 --> 14:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Department of Homeland
Security.

14:42.014 --> 14:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he's named, he would be the
third general
to play a major role in this
administration,

14:47.987 --> 14:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heading the third largest
department in the
federal government.

14:51.324 --> 14:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is Mr. Trump saying by
naming all these
top military -- people with top
military roles?

14:56.262 --> 15:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, first of all,
no announcement's
been made.

15:00.199 --> 15:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, General Kelly is an
outstanding public
servant, somebody who
understands the threats

15:03.970 --> 15:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we face and knows how to
tackle them
and keep America, you know, our
homeland,

15:08.174 --> 15:09.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safe.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would be an excellent choice
if Mr. Trump
eventually chooses him.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think most importantly,
again, you're
talking about 4,000 or 5,000
jobs.

15:15.681 --> 15:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, he's focused on these two
and potentially
third top-ranking military
officials, but

15:21.621 --> 15:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's also looked to successful
businessmen,
Governor Branstad, as you just
mentioned,

15:25.091 --> 15:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor -- excuse me -- Linda
McMahon, a
successful businesswoman.

15:28.461 --> 15:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a very, very broad
group, diverse
group of high-quality,
high-caliber people

15:33.299 --> 15:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who, in their own respective
fields, whether
it's academia, business, or
government, have

15:38.638 --> 15:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shown that they know how to get
the job done.

15:41.340 --> 15:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what Donald Trump
wants, is people
who understand how to be
successful, how to

15:46.312 --> 15:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move this country in the right
direction,
how to lift up the American
worker and put

15:51.083 --> 15:52.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
America first.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
about something
that first lady Michelle Obama
is saying today.

15:56.789 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said in an interview she
stands by what
-- the criticism she made of Mr.
Trump on

16:02.695 --> 16:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign trail, but she
said, like her
husband, she's prepared to help
him as he

16:07.433 --> 16:08.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transitions.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said, "We want him to be
successful."

16:11.137 --> 16:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My question to you is, after the
conversations
Mr. Trump has had with President
Obama, is

16:16.642 --> 16:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he prepared, in any way, to
apologize or pull
back the many, many tough
criticisms he made

16:23.516 --> 16:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of President Obama, in effect
saying he's
harmed this country by his
leadership?

16:27.787 --> 16:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, I think
there's a lot of
things that's said on the
campaign trail in

16:31.858 --> 16:33.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the heat of a political
campaign.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama said very
similar things about
Mr. Trump.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think since election
night, Mr. Trump
extended that olive branch,
talked about uniting

16:40.700 --> 16:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country, bringing us all
together and
moving forward as Americans to
move the country

16:44.470 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forward and lift up everybody.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have had great meetings.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have developed a great
relationship.

16:49.876 --> 16:54.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said earlier today he
continues to enjoy
the president's counsel and has
grown to really

16:54.413 --> 17:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respect the job that he has and
the toughness
of it, his commitment and love
for this country.

17:00.486 --> 17:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Sean
Spicer, does
Mr. Trump stand by his tweet of
a couple of

17:05.224 --> 17:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days ago that three million
votes cast in
this election were cast
illegally, and, if

17:10.396 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so, what does he base that on?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Of course he does.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's based off several
academic reports
that show the number of people.

17:18.170 --> 17:23.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you extrapolate the
percentages in the
reports, come out to about that
much.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, there are a lot of
reports that
point to that.

17:26.178 --> 17:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
there's a dispute
about many of them, but more
time to talk

17:30.816 --> 17:32.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about that later on.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer, thank you very
much.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Thank you, Judy.

17:36.122 --> 17:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And later in the
program, we
will explore president-elect
Trump's relationship

17:40.326 --> 17:43.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the news media.

17:43.996 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The movie
industry has its
Oscars, the music world the
Grammys, and,

17:56.075 --> 18:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure, there are Nobel Prizes in
science, but
the world of science would like
to connect

18:00.246 --> 18:02.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the popular culture.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, there were some
notable awards
in that field held in a
makeshift hangar at

18:05.751 --> 18:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA Ames Research Center in
Silicon Valley,
and that's the focus of our
weekly segment

18:10.656 --> 18:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the Leading Edge of
science and technology.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien is here to tell us
a little
bit more about who won and for
what achievements.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So -- but what is this and who's
behind it?

18:19.465 --> 18:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hari, it's called
the Breakthrough
Prizes.

18:22.168 --> 18:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were founded five years ago
by a few
Silicon Valley moguls.

18:25.838 --> 18:31.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They wanted to recognize
scientists with the
largest cash prizes in science,
glitzy gala,

18:31.877 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big-name stars from tech and
entertainment.

18:34.513 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The scientific rock stars were
honored by
some Hollywood celebrities,
Morgan Freeman,

18:38.851 --> 18:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alicia Keys, Jeremy Irons, Black
Eyed Peas
star Will.i.am, who probably put
it best.

18:45.791 --> 18:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILL.I.AM, Musician: When
somebody graduates
and plays basketball from the
NBA who just

18:51.931 --> 18:53.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came from UCLA, there's a show
about that.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a show called the draft.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And people tune in.

18:58.804 --> 19:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when someone graduates from
MIT and then
ends up working at Google,
nobody knows.

19:06.245 --> 19:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, in popular culture,
like, we do
a very poor job celebrating the
right things.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, I
see three different
categories here, fundamental
physics, life

19:15.021 --> 19:15.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sciences, and math.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's start with life sciences.

19:17.690 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Life sciences is
the largest
of the five topics for
recipients.

19:23.329 --> 19:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each person or awardee group
gets a $3 million
prize for major contributions to
the understanding

19:30.770 --> 19:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the inner workings of life.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for example, Stephen
Elledge, a scientist
at Harvard and he's affiliated
with the Howard

19:36.909 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hughes Medical Institute as
well, was recognized
for his research into how DNA
detects when

19:44.216 --> 19:45.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it is damaged.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here he is explaining it.

19:47.286 --> 19:50.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ELLEDGE, Harvard Medical
School: DNA
has this incredible ability to
sense its own

19:50.289 --> 19:51.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
integrity.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a molecule, but it knows
when it's damaged.

19:54.393 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has built a signaling
apparatus that's
a little bit like sort of a
radio station.

20:00.099 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sends out signals when
there's a problem
and calls in the troops and it
organizes everything.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So it's really about
communication inside
the cell.

20:08.174 --> 20:13.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is key
because disruptions
of this mechanism are linked to
cancer, and

20:13.979 --> 20:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are already some cancer
treatments being
implemented that are based on
this research.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's very exciting, Hari.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
there was a special
category -- award in the
category of physics.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about it.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, physics is
always interesting.

20:26.258 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were some awards which got
into string
theory, which would be too hard
to explain

20:29.929 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the time we have.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this one is very
interesting.

20:32.665 --> 20:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have about it, the Laser
Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory,
or LIGO.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It earned a special prize in
fundamental physics.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is LIGO?

20:43.476 --> 20:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this 1,000-plus-member
team will be
splitting that $3 million prize
for their

20:48.047 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
detection of gravity waves
caused by the merging
two of black holes.

20:53.419 --> 20:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIGO uses lasers to precisely
measure the
position of mirrors separated
from each other

20:58.958 --> 21:00.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by about 2.5 miles.

21:00.726 --> 21:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in addition, it takes these
measurements
at two locations about 1,900
miles apart,

21:06.098 --> 21:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one in Louisiana, one in the
state of Washington.

21:08.968 --> 21:16.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIGO is so sensitive, it
actually measures
the compressing and stretching
of space itself.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the most precise measuring
device ever
built.

21:19.211 --> 21:25.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can detect a disturbance of
-- now, listen
to this -- one part in 1,000
billion billion,

21:25.751 --> 21:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or something like 1/1,000 of the
diameter
of a proton.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is hard to -- it's
mind-boggling.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

21:33.526 --> 21:35.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're deep in the quantum world
here.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, we
don't talk
about math that much, but what
about the math

21:37.897 --> 21:38.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prize?

21:38.898 --> 21:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know folks might have some
flashbacks to
middle school right now, but
this is interesting.

21:44.336 --> 21:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jean Bourgain of Princeton was
awarded for
contributions to
high-dimensional geometry

21:50.075 --> 21:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and some other branches of that.

21:51.911 --> 21:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, his main innovation was
expanding the
Fourier analysis, which I know
you know well,

21:55.948 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hari.

21:57.750 --> 22:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a method to break down
messy signals
into basic repeated components
like a sine

22:02.688 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or cosine graph you might
remember from high
school.

22:05.291 --> 22:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this makes it easier to
understand the
underlying structures of complex
mathematical

22:10.496 --> 22:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situations, both physical and
theoretical.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we better to end it
there, because
it's going to get deep very
quickly.

22:16.435 --> 22:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I remember the
tension in
my geometry classes were whether
or not you

22:19.305 --> 22:21.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should have those Texas
Instruments calculators.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, it's cheating.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You should do these sine graphs
yourselves.

22:24.210 --> 22:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, speaking of life back in
the old days,
there are also prizes for
younger scientists.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What were they getting prizes
for?

22:30.482 --> 22:31.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is exciting stuff.

22:33.252 --> 22:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two high school students, Deanna
See from
Singapore and Antonella Masini
from Peru,

22:39.058 --> 22:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also won the Breakthrough Junior
Challenge.

22:41.694 --> 22:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a competition in which
students from
around the world submitted
videos explaining

22:46.165 --> 22:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some very tough scientific
concepts, probably
better than I am right now.

22:50.302 --> 22:54.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Deanna chose antibiotic
resistance in bacteria.

22:54.673 --> 22:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Antonella discussed quantum
entanglement
-- quantum entanglement, not bad
for a high

22:59.745 --> 23:00.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
schooler.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what does the award mean to
her?

23:03.015 --> 23:05.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Fewer entanglements with
scholarships and
student loans.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's listen.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONELLA MASINI, Breakthrough
Junior Challenge
Winner: I have a little
economical problems

23:09.021 --> 23:10.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at home.

23:10.789 --> 23:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now with this prize, I can
choose any
school that I want, any college
that I want.

23:15.427 --> 23:16.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's unbelievable.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm really grateful -- grateful
for this opportunity.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And will never forget it.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And I have a
feeling, Hari,
we won't forget her either.

23:23.936 --> 23:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Miles, we were
such slackers
compared to just those two kids,
much less

23:28.574 --> 23:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably all the kids that were
nominated
there.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's why we're
here.

23:31.310 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:32.311 --> 23:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

23:33.545 --> 23:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you, Miles O'Brien,
joining us from
Boston tonight.

23:36.215 --> 23:47.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:47.926 --> 23:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
art of the
Qur'an, a new exhibit featuring
ancient manuscripts;

23:54.667 --> 23:59.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a historic recording from
the day that
lived in infamy.

23:59.938 --> 24:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: a pioneer in the
traditionally
male-dominated world of
sportswriting.

24:05.444 --> 24:09.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Claire Smith has been covering
baseball for
more than four decades.

24:09.114 --> 24:14.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was the first
African-American female
reporter to cover the game for a
newspaper.

24:14.353 --> 24:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Working for The New York Times,
The Philadelphia
Inquirer, and The Hartford
Courant during

24:19.224 --> 24:20.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her career.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's now with ESPN.

24:21.694 --> 24:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yesterday, she was awarded
the top honor
for a baseball writer.

24:26.732 --> 24:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smith is the first woman to get
that prize
from the Baseball Writers
Association of America.

24:32.071 --> 24:37.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she joins me now from
covering baseball's
winter meetings in Oxon Hill,
Maryland, where

24:37.176 --> 24:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off-season trades and other
business is being
discussed.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Claire Smith, congratulations.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what does this mean to you?

24:44.750 --> 24:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH, Sportswriter,
ESPN: It means
the world.

24:48.153 --> 24:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I look around this hotel lobby,
I see my peers
out there hard at work.

24:54.259 --> 24:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see so many that I watched
grow up in the
industry, so many that I have
worked with

24:59.798 --> 25:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for three-plus decades.

25:01.533 --> 25:05.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I -- they chose me.

25:05.504 --> 25:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They chose me to be the 68th
winner of this
award.

25:13.278 --> 25:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And previous winners were named
Grantland
Rice, Damon Runyon, Red Smith,
Wendell Smith,

25:20.252 --> 25:22.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sam Lacy.

25:22.087 --> 25:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said, you are the 68th
winner, the
first female, the first
African-American female.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so humbling.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm overwhelmed.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really am.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why baseball?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did you want to write about
and cover
baseball?

25:39.738 --> 25:43.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH: Two words: Jackie
Robinson.

25:43.942 --> 25:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was a child when my mother
told me that
story.

25:47.112 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in those two words, I
thought, this is
a great country.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anything is possible.

25:55.687 --> 26:03.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And within this sport, this
sport taught this
country how to grow up and move
on.

26:03.228 --> 26:09.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It integrated 20-some years
before the United
States of America.

26:09.034 --> 26:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was in elementary school when
the nuns at
Saint James took a third-grade
class down

26:16.041 --> 26:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the church in the basement of
that Elkins
Park, Pennsylvania, school, and
showed us

26:23.482 --> 26:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"The Jackie Robinson Story."

26:25.350 --> 26:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Ruby Dee as Mrs. Rachel
Robinson, and
Jackie Robinson as Jackie
Robinson, they took

26:34.827 --> 26:36.128 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my breath away.

26:36.161 --> 26:41.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They reminded me of my parents,
young and
proud.

26:41.867 --> 26:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wanted to know more about
this couple
and that game and that man named
Branch Rickey.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I loved storytelling.

26:53.011 --> 27:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My parents bought me an old
Olympia typewriter
and gave me paper as a child, a
preteen.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I loved pecking on that.

27:03.856 --> 27:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that story captured my
imagination, and
I still wear Jackie's number a
lot.

27:10.562 --> 27:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I loved the idea of baseball and
what it did
for this country, what Jackie
and the Dodgers

27:17.102 --> 27:18.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is so
inspiring.

27:20.038 --> 27:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once you got into writing
about and covering
baseball, as a woman, you found
out it wasn't

27:26.578 --> 27:30.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as easy as maybe you might have
thought going
in?

27:30.048 --> 27:32.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, I'm particularly
interested in what
happened in 1984.

27:32.518 --> 27:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH: Well, Judy, I had
a long career
with one bad day.

27:41.627 --> 27:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was in 1984 in the
postseason, Padres
at Cubs, a playoff game.

27:49.301 --> 27:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was pushed out, physically
pushed out
of the clubhouse because the
Padres didn't

27:55.807 --> 28:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adhere to the National League's
edict that
the National League controlled
the clubhouses

28:02.014 --> 28:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
once the postseason started.

28:04.483 --> 28:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had so many people jump to my
defense, not
necessarily the Padres club, but
Padres player,

28:14.526 --> 28:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first baseman Steve Garvey, who
left the clubhouse
to make sure that I had quotes,
so I could

28:20.632 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do my job.

28:22.367 --> 28:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he reminded me, as I started
to falter,
that he would stay in that damp,
small area

28:30.709 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Wrigley Field while I pulled
myself together.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would stay as long as I
needed for him
to stay.

28:37.749 --> 28:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he said, "But you have a job
to do."

28:41.553 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he -- that one phrase made
me pull myself
together and do my job.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My peers came to my defense.

28:52.064 --> 28:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the commissioner, Peter
Ueberroth, who
was in his first week in office,
the next

28:58.403 --> 29:07.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
day passed an edict: All
credentialed -- properly
credentialed reporters, no
matter gender,

29:07.879 --> 29:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race, religion, whatever planet
they came
from, get access in Major League
Baseball.

29:14.853 --> 29:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He couldn't believe that it
really hadn't
happened before.

29:18.657 --> 29:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on his watch, from that day
forward, it
was going to happen.

29:22.761 --> 29:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were not
deterred,
and you have kept on ever since
then.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Has it been harder, though, as
an African-American?

29:31.637 --> 29:36.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or have you just not looked back
and thought
about that since then?

29:36.208 --> 29:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH: It was no contest.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was harder because of gender
than race.

29:42.347 --> 29:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have always said that, because
a sport had
-- at that time had a much
larger representation

29:54.426 --> 30:02.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of African-Americans in uniform,
and still
to this day is a very diverse
sport, albeit

30:02.934 --> 30:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more Latin American players of
color than
African-Americans of color, it
would be very

30:09.107 --> 30:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard to be overtly racist
towards anyone in
a clubhouse.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, it's still very easy to
be an idiot.

30:17.115 --> 30:18.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:18.784 --> 30:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH: It might not be in
a club's
best interest to push people out
because of

30:25.457 --> 30:32.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gender, because the
commissioner's office
will come down on you very hard,
but that

30:32.230 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't stop a player from being
obscene,
from being a degenerate, from
just being a

30:41.073 --> 30:42.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jerk.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that happens occasionally,
sadly.

30:44.309 --> 30:53.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a woman is isolated in a town
where a team
has a laissez-faire attitude, it
makes it

30:53.685 --> 30:55.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very difficult.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was very lucky.

30:57.255 --> 31:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I covered a team that was
aggressive in its
approach.

31:01.460 --> 31:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Yankees were very proud to
say that none
of that happened in the
clubhouse.

31:07.432 --> 31:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the time I came along, the
Yankees were
just ferocious in policing their
own clubhouse,

31:14.439 --> 31:16.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the players on up.

31:16.208 --> 31:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had friends who were severely
scarred by
incidents elsewhere in the
country.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

31:23.448 --> 31:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I hope that a lot of young
women who
are thinking about going into
sportswriting

31:28.019 --> 31:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sports news are watching
this and being
inspired by it.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Claire Smith...

31:34.893 --> 31:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH: Well, thank you.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Claire Smith,
congratulations.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE SMITH: Thank so much,
Judy.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I appreciate that.

31:42.200 --> 31:49.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

31:49.741 --> 31:56.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One thing
that's become
clear since the election is the
very different

31:56.348 --> 32:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach president-elect Trump
is taking toward
dealing with the media and his
efforts to

32:00.719 --> 32:03.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talk to the American public more
directly.

32:03.522 --> 32:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To start, let's look at the last
24 hours.

32:07.993 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a most unusual appearance
for a man
whose unpredictability is now
signature.

32:13.865 --> 32:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump showed up
unannounced
in the lobby of his Manhattan
skyscraper yesterday.

32:18.503 --> 32:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Less than an hour earlier, he
tweeted that
costs for a new Air Force One
were out of

32:23.975 --> 32:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
control, and said the order
should be canceled.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke to journalists who've
gathered in
the Trump Tower entrance for
weeks.

32:29.981 --> 32:35.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: It is going
to be over $4 billion for Air
Force One program.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it is ridiculous.

32:38.056 --> 32:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Boeing is doing a little
bit of a
number.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want Boeing to make a lot of
money, but
not that much money.

32:44.663 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House later questioned
the figure Mr. Trump cited.

32:48.533 --> 32:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect later
appeared in the
lobby again to announce an
investment by a

32:52.938 --> 32:55.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Japanese tech mogul.

32:55.607 --> 33:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since his stunning election
night upset, Mr.
Trump hasn't held a single
formal press conference.

33:00.846 --> 33:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he's communicated with
the public
directly, often 140 characters
at a time.

33:07.252 --> 33:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called the protesters who
took to the streets
immediately after his election
-- quote -- "very

33:11.756 --> 33:13.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unfair."

33:13.592 --> 33:16.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said burning the American
flag, which is
protected under the First
Amendment, should

33:16.461 --> 33:19.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be punishable by loss of
citizenship or a
year in jail.

33:20.031 --> 33:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has made announcements about
the plans
for his business interests.

33:23.935 --> 33:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late last month, he challenged
the results
of the popular vote with a false
claim that

33:28.306 --> 33:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- quote -- "millions of people
voted illegally."

33:31.509 --> 33:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He even used the platform to
float names for
potential Cabinet picks, like
Dr. Ben Carson

33:36.748 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the head of Housing and Urban
Development.

33:39.351 --> 33:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a video statement released on
Twitter and
YouTube, Mr. Trump laid out
plans for his

33:43.655 --> 33:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
first 100 days in office.

33:45.457 --> 33:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: My agenda will be
based on a
simple core principle: putting
America first.

33:51.296 --> 33:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it's producing steel,
building cars,
or curing disease, I want the
next generation

33:56.968 --> 34:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of production and innovation to
happen right
here, on our great homeland,
America.

34:02.674 --> 34:07.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
president-elect's choice
to control his own public
communication is

34:07.646 --> 34:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
driven, at least in part, by his
open disdain
for the mainstream media.

34:12.250 --> 34:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Monday, he tweeted: "If the
press would
cover me accurately and
honorably, I would

34:18.189 --> 34:20.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have far less reason to tweet.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sadly, I don't know if that will
ever happen."

34:23.628 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To be sure, past administrations
have had
their disagreements and even
hostile relationships

34:28.366 --> 34:30.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the press.

34:30.135 --> 34:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During his two terms, President
Obama has,
on occasion, used his social
media channels

34:34.572 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to circumvent reporters.

34:36.541 --> 34:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But no leader has taken to such
platforms
like Mr. Trump.

34:40.312 --> 34:44.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last week, during a
post-election review at
Harvard, Mr. Trump's former
campaign manager,

34:44.683 --> 34:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Corey Lewandowski, spoke about
how the president-elect
sees the press.

34:47.852 --> 34:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY LEWANDOWSKI, Former Trump
Campaign Manager:
Donald Trump understands the
media and he

34:51.923 --> 34:56.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
understands the American
electorate and he
understands how to drive a
message.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, Donald Trump also has
the ability
to bypass the mainstream media
by going directly

35:00.932 --> 35:02.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to social media.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
president-elect did
hold an off-the-record meeting
with television

35:05.670 --> 35:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anchors and executives last
month and on-the-record
conversations with The New York
Times and

35:10.475 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street Journal, but he has
also repeatedly
traveled without notifying the
press pool

35:15.313 --> 35:16.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assigned to cover him.

35:16.982 --> 35:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's led reporters to voice
concerns about
a lack of access.

35:20.652 --> 35:24.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump is, however, expected
to hold his
first press conference as
president-elect

35:24.356 --> 35:26.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next Thursday.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a broader look at the
president-elect's
unprecedented relationship with
the press

35:29.861 --> 35:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and unique communication style
with Micheline
Maynard, a veteran journalist
who is covering

35:34.366 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump and the media for
Forbes.com.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Micki Maynard, this isn't the
first time the
president, any president has
wanted to go

35:40.772 --> 35:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk directly to the people or
go around the
pesky press in the middle.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's so different about this?

35:47.645 --> 35:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELINE MAYNARD, Forbes: Well,
I think what's
so different about this is the
unpredictability,

35:51.016 --> 35:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also the fact, you know,
with many presidents,
you could just take -- if they
had a tweet

35:56.021 --> 35:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- this is really our first
tweeting president
-- president-elect.

35:59.524 --> 36:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Obama tweets a little bit,
but it's fairly
structured.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not structured at all.

36:05.030 --> 36:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You almost have to take the
information as
the starting point, because you
can't simply

36:09.334 --> 36:10.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
repeat what he's tweeted.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to give it a little bit
of context.

36:12.771 --> 36:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you were talking about the
Boeing situation
and the over-$4 billion number.

36:18.843 --> 36:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, those of us who cover
aviation who have
kept track of the Air Force One
replacement

36:24.249 --> 36:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
program had never heard a number
like $4 billion.

36:27.352 --> 36:32.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the GAO, the General
Accounting Office,
had never even said that the
program would

36:32.290 --> 36:33.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be $4 billion.

36:34.025 --> 36:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a little bit of a
puzzlement where
some of this information is
coming from.

36:38.329 --> 36:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it does at least give you
something to
go on.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So how do
newsrooms decide
where to put their resources,
chase down the

36:44.669 --> 36:50.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact behind every tweet, or
figure out what
the policy will actually be and
what the actual

36:50.275 --> 36:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
impact on Americans will be?

36:52.077 --> 36:55.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHELINE MAYNARD: The
interesting thing about
Mr. Trump's tweets is that
they're often in

36:55.246 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
response to a news story that he
doesn't like.

36:58.450 --> 37:03.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the Boeing tweet in
particular came a
little while after The Chicago
Tribune ran

37:03.488 --> 37:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a story quoting the CEO of
Boeing as saying
he was a bit concerned about
trade policy

37:08.426 --> 37:10.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under the new Trump
administration.

37:10.228 --> 37:16.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's almost like -- I don't
know how you
guess which company he might
criticize next.

37:16.167 --> 37:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's almost as if you have
to write the
tweet down on one side of a
ledger and then

37:20.505 --> 37:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go look for a link to the story
on the other
side of the ledger and see where
the mesh

37:25.777 --> 37:27.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes in.

37:27.712 --> 37:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There also
seems to be a
gap inside the newsrooms, the
political reporters

37:30.448 --> 37:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on one side and the business
reporters on
the other side not necessarily
seeing the

37:33.751 --> 37:34.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
connections.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHELINE MAYNARD: Right.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're two different
specialties.

37:37.522 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, business journalists, like
myself, we
spend years learning how the
Securities and

37:41.926 --> 37:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Exchange Commission works.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We take classes in business
journalism.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political reporters probably
take political
science classes, spend years in
Washington

37:50.969 --> 37:53.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or in their local state
governments.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The two don't cross that often.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sometimes, they do.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have great publications like
The Wall Street
Journal and The New York Times,
where you

38:00.011 --> 38:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have politically savvy business
reporters,
and vice versa.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's two separate sets of
DNA.

38:05.984 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the challenge for
newsrooms will be
to school reporters who are
trained in politics

38:12.724 --> 38:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in business, and school business
reporters
to look for the politics in
whatever Mr. Trump

38:17.929 --> 38:19.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

38:19.764 --> 38:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Inherently, is
anything
that comes out of a president's
mouth automatically

38:22.200 --> 38:24.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
newsworthy?

38:24.035 --> 38:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he wants to say a tweet like
the flag-burning
one, where he's essentially
challenging the

38:27.505 --> 38:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constitutionality of how we
express ourselves,
isn't that newsworthy, in and of
itself, or

38:32.744 --> 38:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is someone making an editorial
decision, saying,
well, this is a distraction and
we shouldn't

38:36.114 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
put resources on it?

38:37.715 --> 38:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELINE MAYNARD: Well, so far,
I haven't
seen anyone not repeat the
tweets.

38:41.953 --> 38:46.024 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Because he's the
president-elect, because
everybody is looking for clues
about what

38:46.057 --> 38:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of president he will be,
anything he
says right now is newsworthy.

38:49.861 --> 38:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I am watching news
organizations that
just repeat it like they're
stenographers,

38:55.333 --> 39:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and news organizations that say,
wait a minute,
the flag-burning thing, you
know, we're constitutionally

39:00.972 --> 39:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protected if we want to burn the
flag.

39:02.740 --> 39:08.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm looking for people giving
the right
context to their audiences,
whether it's on

39:08.046 --> 39:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the air, in print, or on social
media.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some of the
complaints about
limited access, about the
traveling press

39:14.085 --> 39:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pool or not so many press
conferences, I mean,
some of that is a violation of
tradition or

39:19.591 --> 39:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's personnel preference, but
how does it
actually matter in the
day-to-day coverage

39:22.860 --> 39:24.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the presidency?

39:24.128 --> 39:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why is that important for the
public to have
and to know?

39:26.864 --> 39:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELINE MAYNARD: Well, right
after Mr. Trump
was elected, he went to
Washington, and he

39:31.869 --> 39:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left the pool that was following
him behind.

39:35.306 --> 39:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then he went to dinner, and he
left the pool
that was following him behind.

39:38.743 --> 39:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, those reporters had
been told that
there was a lid on movement for
the night.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that he's not going
to do anything
newsworthy.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, he went out for
dinner with
his family.

39:49.587 --> 39:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know how newsworthy that
was, but
people have made the point that
we had the

39:53.224 --> 39:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
9/11 attacks, people needed to
know where
President Bush was.

39:57.228 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Reagan, sadly, there
was an assassination
attempt, and the pool needed to
know what

40:02.133 --> 40:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was going on with that, and on
and on.

40:04.269 --> 40:09.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we have certainly had
instances in our
history where unexpected events
happened,

40:09.440 --> 40:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a group of reporters,
broadcast, print,
now digital, photographers
needed to be there.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So the pool is important.

40:17.482 --> 40:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we're seeing that
Mr. Trump is
either not aware of traditions
or has his

40:22.787 --> 40:24.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own opinion about them.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Micheline Maynard,
I'm sure we will have more
conversations about

40:27.158 --> 40:28.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this in the future.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks so much.

40:30.728 --> 40:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELINE MAYNARD: Thank you for
having me.

40:40.471 --> 40:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the charged
atmosphere at
this time around the role of
Muslims in America

40:47.945 --> 40:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes what is billed as the
first major exhibition
on in the United States on the
Qur'an.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSUMEH FARHAD, Chief Curator,
Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian
Institution:

40:56.721 --> 40:59.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is one of the great
highlights of the
exhibition.

40:59.757 --> 41:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a Qur'an from the early
14th century,
from about 1330, signed by a
great master.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Signed?

41:10.601 --> 41:11.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MASSUMEH FARHAD: Signed.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

41:13.371 --> 41:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A holy book, as a work of art,
the Qur'an,
sacred to some 1.6 billion
Muslims around

41:18.376 --> 41:20.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

41:20.445 --> 41:25.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A new exhibition at the
Smithsonian Institution's
Sackler Gallery in Washington,
D.C., presents

41:25.850 --> 41:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
68 of the most important and
exquisite Qur'ans
ever produced.

41:30.621 --> 41:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dating from the late 7th to
early 17 centuries,
they come from many parts of the
Islamic world

41:37.128 --> 41:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and are part of the collection
of the Museum
of Turkish and Islamic Arts in
Istanbul.

41:42.867 --> 41:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where Sackler chief
curator Massumeh
Farhad first saw them.

41:46.471 --> 41:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSUMEH FARHAD: I realized that
these were
true works of art, that every
single one of

41:51.542 --> 41:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them was astounding in its sort
of mastery
of calligraphy, of the styles,
and also of

41:59.517 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the scale of the works.

42:01.419 --> 42:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is something that, to
me, was very
important, and motivated me in
trying to organize

42:08.893 --> 42:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this exhibition, because I
thought it really
shifted my perception of what
these works

42:16.434 --> 42:18.169 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

42:18.202 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm hoping that it will also
shift the
perception of the visitors who
come to the

42:21.272 --> 42:23.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
museum to see the exhibition.

42:23.141 --> 42:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Muslims, the
Qur'an is
a divine text, a series of
revelations transmitted

42:28.379 --> 42:33.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the angel Gabriel to the
Prophet Mohammed
between 610 and 632.

42:33.584 --> 42:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes references to
earlier figures,
including Abraham, Moses and
Jesus.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The term itself means
recitation.

42:41.459 --> 42:44.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Qur'an stems from an oral
tradition.

42:44.362 --> 42:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the text was written down
and codified
in a fixed form not long after
the death of

42:49.434 --> 42:51.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mohammed.

42:51.369 --> 42:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maria Dakake teaches Islamic
religious thought
and history at George Mason
University.

42:55.773 --> 42:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA DAKAKE, George Mason
University: One
of the things that is rather
striking about

42:58.342 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Qur'an when people read it
for the first
time is that it often takes the
form of direct

43:03.748 --> 43:04.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
address.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it will say sometimes, oh,
you who believe.

43:07.585 --> 43:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, it will address all
human beings,
oh, humankind.

43:11.889 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is a series of moral
exhortations, exhortations
to virtue.

43:17.728 --> 43:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes many stories of
prophets before
the time of Mohammed.

43:22.266 --> 43:27.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an attempt to grab the
listener, or
grab the reader, to wake them
up, to make

43:27.271 --> 43:31.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them think about their life,
about the world
around them.

43:31.309 --> 43:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a lot of passages with
rhetorical sentences,
right?

43:36.380 --> 43:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did you not consider this?

43:38.483 --> 43:39.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Didn't you think about this?

43:39.484 --> 43:41.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did you get here?

43:41.385 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The exhibition
includes furniture,
stands to hold manuscripts, and
chests to

43:46.357 --> 43:48.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
store them.

43:48.125 --> 43:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of these Qur'ans were
originally commissioned
and donated or collected by
rulers.

43:52.697 --> 43:58.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early manuscripts, on parchment,
feature plain
ink and simple designs.

43:58.436 --> 44:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, artists and calligraphers
developed
ever more elaborate and ornate
script, illumination,

44:05.142 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and geometric patterns, in light
of Islam's
proscription against figurative
images, to

44:10.114 --> 44:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make each manuscript a singular
work.

44:12.583 --> 44:19.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MASSUMEH FARHAD: It's how they
sort of use
their individuality is really
quite remarkable.

44:19.457 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the greater master, the
better they can
sort of manipulate the style
without breaking

44:26.531 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rules, because you could not
break the
rules of a particular style of
calligraphy,

44:31.102 --> 44:37.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but you could sort of stretch
them, and sort
of introduce your own sort of
touch to a particular

44:37.208 --> 44:40.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
style or a particular type of
writing.

44:40.678 --> 44:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some of these
masters are well
known to scholars, like the
maker of this

44:45.049 --> 44:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Qur'an, Abdullah Sayrafi, who
spent most of
his life in Tabriz in
Northwestern Iran.

44:50.221 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MASSUMEH FARHAD: What is
remarkable about
Abdullah Sayrafi is the fact
that he was able

44:57.028 --> 45:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to write in more than one style
of calligraphy,
because, usually, most
calligraphers specialized

45:04.936 --> 45:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in one style and one particular
size alone.

45:07.972 --> 45:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was clearly a Qur'an that was
meant for
display.

45:11.409 --> 45:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is so lavish in its use of
both illumination,
in terms of that very rich black
ink, the

45:20.618 --> 45:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fact that every gold line is
outlined in black.

45:23.554 --> 45:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is a visual feast,
and it's supposed
to be viewed and looked at.

45:30.294 --> 45:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was meant as a display
copy.

45:32.863 --> 45:35.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How long would it
take to do
something like this?

45:35.333 --> 45:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSUMEH FARHAD: Many years.

45:36.767 --> 45:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Years for each
one?

45:38.235 --> 45:40.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSUMEH FARHAD: For each one.

45:40.037 --> 45:43.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even amid a
highly contentious
and politicized atmosphere today
concerning

45:43.774 --> 45:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims in America, the curators
say this
exhibition was long in the
works, and the

45:49.046 --> 45:51.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
timing is coincidental.

45:51.382 --> 45:56.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For her part, Maria Dakake hopes
it will shine
a different kind of spotlight on
Islam and

45:56.621 --> 45:58.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Qur'an.

45:58.155 --> 46:00.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA DAKAKE: You will hear
sometimes Islamophobic
comments about Islam.

46:00.791 --> 46:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will say, well, you
know, why would
I want to know anything about
this text?

46:05.196 --> 46:07.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I see what kinds of things it
produces, right?

46:07.431 --> 46:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It produces people who behave in
these violent
ways or something like that.

46:11.135 --> 46:15.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you come here, you see
the larger
reality of what it produced,
right?

46:15.640 --> 46:17.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It produced beauty.

46:17.808 --> 46:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It produced scientific inquiry.

46:20.077 --> 46:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It inspired literary endeavors.

46:22.880 --> 46:29.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a time of Islamophobia, I
think what's
so valuable about this
collection is to see

46:29.286 --> 46:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of artistic elements,
the beauty
that the Qur'an really brought.

46:34.692 --> 46:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Art of the
Qur'an is on
exhibition through February.

46:40.865 --> 46:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Sackler Gallery in
Washington, D.C.,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

46:51.442 --> 47:03.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a perspective
on the benefits
of learning and speaking a
foreign language.

47:03.254 --> 47:07.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lauren Collins is a
correspondent for "The
New Yorker" magazine, and she
brings us the

47:07.758 --> 47:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
latest installment in our series
IMHO: In
My Humble Opinion.

47:12.963 --> 47:18.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LAUREN COLLINS, "The New
Yorker": (SPEAKING
FRENCH)

47:18.669 --> 47:23.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I just said is that, five
years ago,
I didn't speak a word of French.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And why would I have?

47:24.508 --> 47:26.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was born and raised in a small
town in North
Carolina.

47:26.811 --> 47:31.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In high school, I took Spanish,
and like a
lot of people who take high
school Spanish,

47:32.016 --> 47:36.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I failed to retain much more
than hola and
gracias and habla English?

47:36.087 --> 47:38.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess at the time, it didn't
seem all that
important.

47:38.923 --> 47:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have come to believe that
learning a
foreign language is a quietly
revolutionary

47:43.761 --> 47:47.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
act and that there's never been
a better time
to do it.

47:47.631 --> 47:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My French revolution started
when I met a
man named Olivier at a party.

47:51.936 --> 47:56.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Besides the fact that we were
both living
in London, we had exactly zero
in common,

47:56.574 --> 47:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but somehow we got to talking
and neither
of us wanted to stop.

47:59.310 --> 48:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olivier spoke beautiful English,
so it wasn't
a big deal that I didn't speak
his language.

48:04.749 --> 48:06.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But then things got serious, and
we got married.

48:06.951 --> 48:09.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I told his mother I had
given birth to
a coffee machine.

48:09.487 --> 48:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we moved to French-speaking
Switzerland,
and eventually it became clear
that I was

48:14.191 --> 48:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to have to learn French.

48:16.727 --> 48:18.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I signed up for an intensive
class.

48:18.863 --> 48:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My fellow students came from all
over the
world, Germany, Argentina,
Japan.

48:23.000 --> 48:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The funny thing about French
classes, they're
the one place that, by
definition, you're

48:28.539 --> 48:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never going to find someone who
speaks French.

48:31.809 --> 48:32.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I kept at it.

48:32.810 --> 48:34.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We all did.

48:34.078 --> 48:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, very slowly, I found myself
getting the
hang of things.

48:37.848 --> 48:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day, something clicked, and
I heard my
husband's voice for the first
time.

48:41.685 --> 48:45.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are so many advantages to
learning a
language.

48:45.990 --> 48:48.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Being bilingual improves your
memory.

48:48.459 --> 48:52.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And several studies have
suggested that it
may even stave off Alzheimer's
and dementia.

48:52.897 --> 48:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for me, most incredible
thing was being
all of a sudden privy to a
parallel world

48:58.202 --> 49:03.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hadn't even known existed, a
world in which
there was a word for a person
who got cold

49:03.374 --> 49:08.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easily, where a man's shirt was
feminine,
but a woman's shirt was
masculine, where there

49:08.212 --> 49:10.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wasn't just one past tense, but
two.

49:10.815 --> 49:16.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each time, I had to decide
whether a person
was a vous or a tu, an
acquaintance or an

49:16.554 --> 49:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intimate, which is to say
basically every
time I encountered someone.

49:19.790 --> 49:25.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt my boundaries shifting,
my relationships
being recategorized into public
and private.

49:26.030 --> 49:30.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What if, in this moment of
rising intolerance,
nationalism and xenophobia, we
could all put

49:30.935 --> 49:33.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ourselves in another person's
tongue?

49:33.771 --> 49:38.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you learn a language, you
benefit not
only yourself, but also society.

49:38.309 --> 49:43.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Botching conjugations and
brandishing your
ridiculous accent, you develop
empathy.

49:43.581 --> 49:51.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You start to see that the world
looks different,
depending on where you stand and
what you

49:51.155 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speak.

49:54.291 --> 50:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye,
that might

50:03.100 --> 50:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be of interest to you, too.

50:05.102 --> 50:10.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we noted earlier, today marks
the 75th
anniversary of Japan's surprise
attack on

50:10.174 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pearl Harbor.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ensuing battle claimed the
lives of more
than 2,400 Americans, and
triggered U.S. involvement

50:16.013 --> 50:17.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in World War II.

50:17.815 --> 50:23.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An unknown NBC reporter in
Honolulu spoke
by telephone that day in a
dispatch that was

50:23.187 --> 50:25.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broadcast live across the
nation.

50:25.789 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's an excerpt:

50:26.790 --> 50:27.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTER: One, two, three, four.

50:27.791 --> 50:28.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hello, NBC.

50:28.792 --> 50:29.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hello, NBC.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is KGU in Honolulu, Hawaii.

50:31.295 --> 50:33.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am speaking from the roof of
the Advertiser
Publishing Company building.

50:33.063 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have witnessed this morning a
distant view
of a brief full battle of Pearl
Harbor and

50:36.567 --> 50:41.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a severe bombing of Pearl Harbor
by enemy
planes, undoubtedly Japanese.

50:41.505 --> 50:46.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city of Honolulu has also
been attacked,
and considerable damage done.

50:46.911 --> 50:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This battle has been going on
for nearly three
hours.

50:51.415 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the bombs dropped within
50 feet of
KGU tower.

50:53.751 --> 50:54.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is no joke.

50:54.752 --> 50:56.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a real war.

50:56.520 --> 51:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The public of Honolulu has been
advised to
keep in their homes and await
results from

51:05.829 --> 51:08.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Army and Navy.

51:08.198 --> 51:16.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been fierce fighting
going on in
the air and on the sea.

51:16.740 --> 51:23.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The heavy shooting seems to be
-- one, two,
three, four.

51:23.681 --> 51:26.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Just a moment.

51:26.917 --> 51:30.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We'll interrupt here.

51:30.721 --> 51:40.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We cannot estimate yet how much
damage has
been done, but it has been a
very severe attack.

51:40.764 --> 51:53.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We cannot estimate yet how much
damage has
been done, but it has been a
very severe attack.

51:53.544 --> 52:03.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Navy and Army appear now
to have the
air and the sea under control.

52:03.654 --> 52:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Navy and Army appear now
to have the
air and the sea under control.

52:10.961 --> 52:14.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly
brings us back
to that terrible day.

52:14.965 --> 52:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes, I wonder
what it was
like to hear that on the radio
everywhere.

52:17.601 --> 52:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure it was one of those
moments where
everyone knew exactly, if they
were alive

52:20.371 --> 52:21.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at that point to hear it.

52:21.739 --> 52:24.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Seventy-five
years ago this
day.

52:24.475 --> 52:29.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the "NewsHour" online
right now, we
share letters to our late
colleague Gwen Ifill

52:29.580 --> 52:34.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from women journalists of color
about what
she meant to them as a personal
friend and

52:34.451 --> 52:37.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mentor and as a pioneering icon.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:40.924 --> 52:43.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in later
tonight.

52:43.494 --> 52:48.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "Charlie Rose," author
Michael Lewis explores
how we make decisions in "The
Undoing Project."

52:48.966 --> 52:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:50.801 --> 52:55.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, we start a special
series following
three women on a mission to
serve in newly

52:55.105 --> 52:57.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opened combat roles in the
Marines.

52:57.474 --> 52:58.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

52:58.475 --> 52:59.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

52:59.543 --> 53:02.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:02.112 --> 53:12.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
