JUDY WOODRUFF: As senators
continue their fight over
health care, there are new feuds

00:03.833 --> 00:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bubbling on the other end
of Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:06.466 --> 00:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From cracking down on
leaks to weighing Attorney
General Jeff Sessions'
future, and the president

00:13.533 --> 00:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
calling for an end to
transgender military
service members, the
White House is putting

00:16.633 --> 00:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out a number of fires this week.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We turn to Karine Jean-Pierre.

00:20.866 --> 00:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a senior adviser to
MoveOn.org and a veteran of
the Obama administration.

00:27.833 --> 00:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Matt Schlapp, he's
the chairman of the
American Conservative
Union and the former

00:30.500 --> 00:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deputy political director
for President George W. Bush.

00:34.733 --> 00:37.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And welcome to both of
you, Matt and Karine.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaking of fires, I have to
ask both of you first about a
story, a remarkable story that

00:44.600 --> 00:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has just appeared late
this afternoon in "The New
Yorker" magazine, Matt.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially it's the new
head of communications at
the White House, Anthony
Scaramucci, placing

00:53.833 --> 00:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a phone call last night
to the writer Ryan
Lizza and screaming at
him, wanting to know

00:59.166 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who leaked information
about a dinner, using
very strong language,
threatening -- virtually

01:04.066 --> 01:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatening him, saying, I need
to know who the leakers are,
saying he's gone to the FBI,

01:08.566 --> 01:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Department of Justice.

01:10.133 --> 01:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's going on at
the White House?

01:12.100 --> 01:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White
House Director of Political
Affairs: Well, on my drive over

01:14.100 --> 01:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the studio, I was going to
have my 14-year-old daughter
read this article to me.

01:15.666 --> 01:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm glad I didn't,
because it does have
some colorful language.

01:18.100 --> 01:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Anthony Scaramucci
is already out on
Twitter apologizing
for the language, but

01:22.433 --> 01:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the key here is
that this whole question
of leaks inside the
West Wing, it is a real

01:28.933 --> 01:31.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for those of us who want
President Trump to succeed in
his agenda, to succeed, it's

01:34.733 --> 01:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been a real distraction to
getting the agenda through.

01:37.766 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Scaramucci's trying
to take care of the leaks,
and, unfortunately, he thought

01:45.166 --> 01:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was having a conversation
that was off-the-record,
but apparently he didn't
make that clear to

01:47.533 --> 01:49.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the reporter.

01:49.666 --> 01:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, what
does it say when you have this
level of leaking and animosity

01:53.466 --> 01:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going on inside the
White House this early
in the administration?

01:57.066 --> 01:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE,
Democratic Strategist:
Well, it's quite insane.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I worked in the White House
in the Obama administration.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never seen
anything like this before.

02:05.066 --> 02:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if this is Scaramucci's
role, is to take care of the
leaks, that's really going to

02:11.433 --> 02:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a full-time job for him.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, honestly, Judy, if he is
-- if that is something that
he's truly working on, he needs

02:17.533 --> 02:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to start in the Oval Office.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He needs to start from
the top all the way down.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's where the leaks are.

02:22.766 --> 02:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not the junior staffers.

02:24.733 --> 02:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the senior staffers,
starting with Donald
Trump, the president.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the senior staffers are
just trying the save their jobs.

02:31.333 --> 02:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why they're
leaking the way that they are.

02:34.333 --> 02:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, also, this is a reason
why for the first six months of
the administration, that this

02:40.766 --> 02:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration has not been
able to get anything done.

02:42.766 --> 02:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have not really passed
one piece of major legislation,
because of stuff like this.

02:49.533 --> 02:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt, what
about that, the fact that it's
just -- it's not just -- it's

02:51.600 --> 02:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not lower-level people who
are talking to the press; it's
people up and down and going

02:54.733 --> 02:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the way to the top
of the White House?

02:56.966 --> 02:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes.

02:58.666 --> 03:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I mean, there are
always leaks that come
out of the White House.

03:00.833 --> 03:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, those leaks are
intended to inform the press in
kind of an anonymous fashion.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what's happened in the
Trump White House, it's just a
melee of weeks, where people are

03:08.800 --> 03:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaking on each other
in the West Wing.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

03:12.700 --> 03:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think that the
White House - - the West Wing
wasn't set up to be efficient

03:17.766 --> 03:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and successful from
the very beginning.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they actually can look
at the way that they set up
the West Wing, and there's

03:23.433 --> 03:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not a kind of a sheriff in town.

03:25.466 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember, when I worked for
Andy Card in the West Wing,
and he told me, especially

03:28.500 --> 03:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I took the job as political
director, he said, if you
miss -- if you overstep your

03:32.700 --> 03:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trust with the president, there
will be a cardboard box on
your desk, fill it and leave.

03:36.866 --> 03:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Well, I was struck.

03:38.033 --> 03:40.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just...

03:40.100 --> 03:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Now, he didn't
do that to me, but he would
have done it had I overstepped

03:41.533 --> 03:43.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the boundaries.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to stay
with you just a moment, Matt,
because there is a line in

03:45.200 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here that really strikes me.

03:47.133 --> 03:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan Lizza with "The New
Yorker" writes, he said: "Unlike
other Trump advisers, I have

03:50.533 --> 03:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never heard him," meaning
Scaramucci, "say a bad
word about the president."

03:54.933 --> 03:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he's saying everybody
else is criticizing the
president who hired them.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, I don't
want the get into - - I don't
know these conversations.

04:02.633 --> 04:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I can tell you is that
one of the issues, as the West
Wing was pulled together, the

04:06.633 --> 04:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staff was pulled together, is
it was kind of an interesting
concoction of people that

04:10.833 --> 04:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weren't really with the
president's campaign.

04:13.633 --> 04:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he did pull together people,
maybe in the hopes to kind
of like bring kind of unity

04:18.533 --> 04:20.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the party.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it has always been fearful
that you had people who were
either never-Trump or didn't

04:24.200 --> 04:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have much respect for the Trump
-- for President Trump who got
senior administration positions.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I worked for a Republican
president who I admired and
who I loved and I would have

04:34.433 --> 04:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just done almost anything for
professionally, and when you
don't have that spirit with some

04:40.566 --> 04:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staffers, it can cause
a lot of problems.

04:42.666 --> 04:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, I know
I'm asking you as an outsider
and somebody from the other

04:44.600 --> 04:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party to weigh in on this, but
do you see a solution here?

04:48.566 --> 04:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
No, not at all.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think I have said this
before on your show, Judy,
which is the fish rots at his

04:55.300 --> 04:56.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
head.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the type of environment
that Donald Trump has set up.

04:59.366 --> 05:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's brought in the
corporate life, the way he
was as a CEO, as the head
of Trump Organization,

05:05.133 --> 05:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and brought it into
the White House.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He loves this stuff.

05:07.066 --> 05:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He loves the inter-fighting.

05:09.366 --> 05:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He likes when they're fighting
for his -- the dear leader
affection of Donald Trump.

05:15.933 --> 05:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it's not going
to -- it doesn't matter
if it's Scaramucci.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't matter who it is.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't matter if
Priebus stays or leaves.

05:20.633 --> 05:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It starts with the person at the
top, and that's Donald Trump.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, one
other -- two other things I
want to ask you both about,

05:26.633 --> 05:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but first the announcement
by Twitter yesterday
from the president that
he wanted to ban all

05:33.033 --> 05:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who are transgender
from serving in the military.

05:35.466 --> 05:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Matt, I want to go back
and remind -- show everybody in
our audience, this is what the

05:40.133 --> 05:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president had to say last year,
just a year ago, that this
was the day after the Orlando

05:46.200 --> 05:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nightclub shooting.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave a national security
speech in New Hampshire, and
here's what he had to say.

05:51.566 --> 05:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: Ask yourself,
who is really the friend of

05:58.633 --> 06:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
women and the LB -- and
LGBT community, Donald
Trump, with actions, or
Hillary Clinton, with

06:05.533 --> 06:07.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her words?

06:07.566 --> 06:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will tell you who the better
friend is, and, someday, I
believe that will be proven

06:13.566 --> 06:15.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out bigly.

06:15.466 --> 06:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Matt,
how do you explain the
transgender military decision?

06:18.666 --> 06:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, for
seven-and-a-half years of
the Obama administration,
they had a prohibition

06:25.033 --> 06:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that equates to what
President Trump announced.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, all we have is a tweet.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know what
it means in detail.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what it means for
the people serving, but you
get to this basic question,

06:33.800 --> 06:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, which is, you know,
what do the commanders
want in the field, right?

06:37.466 --> 06:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that what was
intended by this administration,
at least what Sarah Huckabee

06:42.266 --> 06:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders said, to expand upon the
tweet, was that he is listening
to the services and what

06:47.866 --> 06:49.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want.

06:49.933 --> 06:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for seven-and-a-half years
in the Obama administration,
they had a similar plan, not

06:52.333 --> 06:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I think there was
animus towards transgender
people or the gay community.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it was because they were
simply focusing on what generals
were saying they needed to

07:01.833 --> 07:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be ready in the field.

07:03.566 --> 07:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this will all be
handled in Congress.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The funding all goes through
Congress, and we will have a
democratic debate on whether

07:08.866 --> 07:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or not this should
happen or not.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Karine, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, General Joe Dunford,

07:13.933 --> 07:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said today that -- they said,
we're waiting for guidance.

07:17.366 --> 07:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we want to
continue to respect
everybody in the military.

07:20.533 --> 07:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
That's right, Judy.

07:22.900 --> 07:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, usually, when
you make this type of
policy, you articulate
it on paper, you create

07:28.633 --> 07:29.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a policy.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't tweet about it.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so the Pentagon can't
actually act on this.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can't act on a tweet.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were never given
a piece of policy.

07:38.433 --> 07:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, once again, you have
a president who doesn't care
to learn, who doesn't know how

07:42.866 --> 07:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the process works, and
he uses Twitter to put --
to really feed his base.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what we're seeing.

07:50.966 --> 07:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, look, the other part about
this, too, is that he made that
promise during the election.

07:54.666 --> 07:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was an outrageous
comment when we heard it.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one ever -- no one
really, truly believed it.

07:59.633 --> 08:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it became a lie on day
one of his administration.

08:03.066 --> 08:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not an administration
that cares about brown people,
black people or transgendered

08:08.800 --> 08:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or LGBT communities.

08:09.733 --> 08:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen this -- or women.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt?

08:13.033 --> 08:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I don't think
that accurately describes
Donald Trump's heart.

08:14.633 --> 08:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have talked to him about
these sets of issues.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For seven-and-a-half years
of the Obama administration,
they had the very same policy.

08:20.766 --> 08:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that President
Obama was discriminating
for those seven-and-a-half

08:24.133 --> 08:25.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think the
next question on...

08:27.400 --> 08:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying
it was only at the end when
they changed the policy.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: They
changed it at the end.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, really, the military
hasn't understood how
to implement this.

08:32.866 --> 08:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Secretary of Defense
Mattis and all of the service
chiefs knew that they were in

08:37.766 --> 08:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the process of review.

08:39.066 --> 08:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have been discussing this.

08:41.166 --> 08:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who track this issue knew
that they were trying to figure
out, could this be implemented

08:44.700 --> 08:45.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

08:45.933 --> 08:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
still no paper.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was a tweet.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well,
the announcement is
completely unconventional.

08:50.666 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard for somebody
like me to even explain
what the implications are.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The country needs
the details on this.

08:55.766 --> 08:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think Karine's point
on that is very fair.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
finally, to both of you, Karine.

09:01.233 --> 09:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You expect the attorney general
to stay where he is, Jeff
Sessions, given what's going on?

09:05.833 --> 09:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Well, I will try to be
really quick here, Judy.

09:08.833 --> 09:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Look, I do not think the
attorney general should
be the attorney general.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think he is a racist.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he has
racist background.

09:15.966 --> 09:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he lied and perjured
himself in front of Congress.

09:19.133 --> 09:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's not the reason
why Donald Trump doesn't
want him in the job anymore.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't want him in the job
because of the Russia thing.

09:25.366 --> 09:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants -- he was upset
that Sessions didn't
recuse himself, and he
wants to fire Bob Mueller.

09:31.933 --> 09:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why he wants to
get rid of Sessions.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: President Trump
doesn't want Jeff Sessions to
leave the office of the attorney

09:38.433 --> 09:40.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

09:40.466 --> 09:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what President Trump
is saying is, he's frustrated
that a special counsel was

09:43.100 --> 09:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picked without it even being
run by Jeff Sessions, and
that that investigation
seems to be overshadowing

09:48.766 --> 09:50.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his presidency.

09:50.733 --> 09:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you have seen the leaks
that have come out against
Donald Trump, when you have seen

09:53.766 --> 09:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the DNC has a
staffer that's worked
with the government of
Ukraine, there are plenty

09:56.833 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things on the other side
of the ledger that I think
Republicans would like to see

10:00.533 --> 10:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DOJ look at as well.

10:02.566 --> 10:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's been pretty
tough on this attorney general,
though, the last few days.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: He has been.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

10:09.466 --> 10:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt
Schlapp, Karine
Jean-Pierre, thank you both.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thank you, Judy.

10:11.566 --> 10:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thanks, Judy.
