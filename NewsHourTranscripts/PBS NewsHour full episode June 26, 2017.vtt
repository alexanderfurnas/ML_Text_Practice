JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.766 --> 00:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.266 --> 00:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: the
travel ban at the Supreme Court.

00:10.666 --> 00:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justices agree parts of
President Trump's controversial
executive order can start now,

00:16.800 --> 00:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and will hear the
full case in the fall.

00:19.766 --> 00:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: Senate Republicans
scramble to keep their health
care bill alive, releasing a

00:26.233 --> 00:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revised measure amid wavering
support from within the party.

00:29.433 --> 00:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the first part
of my conversation
with Warren Buffett.

00:33.533 --> 00:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We discuss inequality in
the U.S. and America's
shifting role in the world.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman and
CEO, Berkshire Hathaway: We do
not have quite the percentage

00:42.666 --> 00:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the world's GDP that we
had 20 or 30 or 40 years ago,
but we're still the leader.

00:48.666 --> 00:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether we
can be the moral leader, as
well as the economic leader.

00:50.166 --> 00:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.833 --> 01:00.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.666 --> 01:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This final day
of the Supreme Court term has
revived a controversial item

01:10.833 --> 01:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on President Trump's
agenda: his travel ban.

01:14.033 --> 01:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices announced that
they will hear arguments this
fall on the constitutionality

01:18.600 --> 01:20.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the ban.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, they reinstated
a limited version of the
order, affecting travelers

01:25.666 --> 01:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from six mostly-Muslim
countries.

01:27.866 --> 01:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump lauded the Supreme
Court's action today as --
quote -- "a clear victory for

01:32.500 --> 01:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our national security," adding:
"It allows the travel suspension
for the six terror-prone

01:39.366 --> 01:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries and the refugee
suspension to become
largely effective."

01:45.100 --> 01:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We explore the legal and
practical implications
now with our regular
Supreme Court watcher

01:48.066 --> 01:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal," and Alan Gomez.

01:51.666 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He covers immigration
for USA Today.

01:54.900 --> 01:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marcia, let's start with you.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's take this one at a time.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got two things that
the court was asked to look at
by the Trump administration,

02:05.166 --> 02:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
first to grant review
on hearing the arguments
on the executive order.

02:08.266 --> 02:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National
Law Journal": Right, Judy.

02:10.333 --> 02:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The legal challenges
to the executive order
focused on basically two
provisions, the 90-day

02:16.733 --> 02:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel ban from six
predominantly Muslim
countries and the 120-day
suspension of the U.S. refugee

02:24.600 --> 02:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assistance program.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government asks the
Supreme Court to review
two federal appellate
court rulings that struck

02:33.033 --> 02:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down the executive order, one,
and they ruled separately,
claiming that the order violated

02:39.200 --> 02:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Establishment Clause of
the constitution because it
was religious discrimination.

02:44.900 --> 02:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a second ground was that
the executive order exceeded
the president's authority under

02:51.733 --> 02:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal immigration
law, a provision, in
particular, that prohibits
discrimination on the basis

02:57.000 --> 02:59.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nationality.

02:59.033 --> 03:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court said it would
hear arguments on the merits
of those two appellate court

03:04.266 --> 03:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rulings in October.

03:06.333 --> 03:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime
and, separately, the justices
were also asked by the Trump

03:09.733 --> 03:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration to lift the
injunctions that had been
imposed on the travel ban.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did they say about that?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, those two federal appellate
courts had approved injunctions
blocking the travel ban

03:21.100 --> 03:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the suspension of
the refugee program.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court said that the
bans would be lifted only --
would be applied only against

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign nationals who had
no bona fide relationship
with an individual or
an entity in the United

03:42.666 --> 03:44.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

03:44.633 --> 03:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the court went on to explain
that in terms of a bona fide
relationship, it should be

03:50.833 --> 03:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a familial relationship with an
individual or, when it comes to
an entity, a formal documented

03:56.100 --> 04:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship, for example, a
student has been accepted at a
university in the United States.

04:03.066 --> 04:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they were
imposing a -- there had to be
some connection already with the

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Exactly.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For
these individuals.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three justices disagreed
with this partial listing.

04:12.233 --> 04:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did they say?

04:14.366 --> 04:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Justice Thomas
wrote for the dissenters and
was joined by Justices Alito

04:17.466 --> 04:19.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Gorsuch.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Thomas explained --
he was most in disagreement
about the partial lifting of

04:25.133 --> 04:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the injunctions against
the executive order.

04:27.933 --> 04:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it was unworkable,
that it was going to create a
flood gate of litigation as the

04:32.633 --> 04:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government, as government
officials tried to determine
what is a bona fide relationship

04:38.500 --> 04:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with an individual or an entity?

04:40.533 --> 04:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those three justices would have
kept -- would have allowed the
ban and the executive order

04:45.966 --> 04:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to go into full effect.

04:47.466 --> 04:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Alan
Gomez, let me turn to you.

04:49.133 --> 04:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You report, as we said, on
immigration, travel issues.

04:52.433 --> 04:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the immediate
effect of this ruling today?

04:56.633 --> 05:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: The
immediate effect is that this
travel ban or what's left of

05:01.266 --> 05:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it can go into effect
as early as Thursday.

05:04.766 --> 05:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's important to note that,
once it does into effect, this
is going to look very different

05:09.133 --> 05:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from what we saw back in
January, when President
Trump first signed his
first travel ban on

05:14.066 --> 05:16.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
January 27.

05:16.133 --> 05:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you remember, at the time,
everybody from these countries
was blocked from entering

05:19.733 --> 05:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, so people were
stranded at U.S. airports or
blocked from getting onto their

05:24.433 --> 05:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S.-bound flights overseas.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But things have changed
dramatically since then.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His revised travel ban
allows for green card
holders to travel, allows
for people who hold

05:33.066 --> 05:35.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
visas to travel.

05:35.166 --> 05:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now what the Supreme Court
has ordered, this establishing
this bona fide relationship

05:41.533 --> 05:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Marcia was explaining a
second ago, that's where we're
going to start trying to figure

05:43.566 --> 05:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out -- that's where
the government is going
to start trying to
figure out who can come

05:46.866 --> 05:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in and who cannot.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's a lot of gray
area and we do expect to see
some litigation about this,

05:55.966 --> 05:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it's -- it's one thing
if you have a relative in the
U.S. who is trying to claim

05:59.100 --> 06:00.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That person can come in.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you have a job offer
from a U.S. employer,
that person can come in.

06:04.433 --> 06:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what if you're just
businessperson coming over here
to have a couple of meetings on

06:08.200 --> 06:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a short-term visa?

06:09.533 --> 06:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that a bona
fide relationship?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a tourist who already
has hotel reservations and
plane reservations, is that

06:15.233 --> 06:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a bona fide relationship?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what we're going to
start seeing in those first
couple days when the ban finally

06:19.833 --> 06:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goes into effect.

06:21.066 --> 06:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
that's my question.

06:22.733 --> 06:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Just how clear are
these guidelines that
the justices set down?

06:26.433 --> 06:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we assume immigration
officials are scrambling
today to put this in
black and white to figure

06:31.300 --> 06:33.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it out?

06:33.400 --> 06:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: There are a lot of
attorneys within the Department
of Justice and Homeland Security

06:36.100 --> 06:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the State Department
and a lot of immigration
advocacy attorneys who
are just diving into

06:43.066 --> 06:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
whatever case law,
whatever precedents they
can find to figure out
what exactly this bona

06:45.600 --> 06:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fide relationship is.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The justices provided
a few examples that we
have cited already, if
you have a job offer,

06:51.666 --> 06:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you have been admitted
to a U.S. university and if
you have a direct relative.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But beyond that, it's
pretty much wide open now.

06:59.566 --> 07:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're trying to figure
out what that means.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To give some context here, in
2016, about 108,000 people came
to the United States legally

07:08.166 --> 07:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from these six countries.

07:10.333 --> 07:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From a quick accounting of
that, the majority of them will
still be allowed to enter the

07:13.800 --> 07:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country under the guidelines
set forth by the Supreme Court,
because most of those were

07:20.233 --> 07:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees, had no direct ties
that we're talking about.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

07:23.266 --> 07:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: But once we get
into some of that other visa
categories that the relationship

07:26.333 --> 07:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a little bit more tenuous,
that is what has to play out
in the next few weeks, to

07:30.233 --> 07:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see what government determines
to be a bona fide relationship
and whether the courts agree

07:34.666 --> 07:36.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with them.

07:36.133 --> 07:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very final
quick question, Alan.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The travel ban that was issued
by the president last March was
intended to be temporary while

07:43.900 --> 07:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the government figured
out vetting procedures.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They said it was
going to take 90 days.

07:48.566 --> 07:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does that stand?

07:50.033 --> 07:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, that review
finally started last week.

07:53.566 --> 07:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a separate ruling, the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco sort of

07:57.466 --> 08:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separated that vetting review
from this legal case that we're
going through right now and

08:02.200 --> 08:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that the administration can
start conducting that review.

08:05.533 --> 08:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In short, what they're trying
to do is gauge what kind of
information we get from foreign

08:10.233 --> 08:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governments to screen people
coming into the country.

08:13.233 --> 08:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So they just started
doing that last Monday.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so, right, the
clock starts now.

08:18.566 --> 08:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have -- they're going to
review it for 20 days, submit
a list to the president.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then those governments will have
50 days to get off the list.

08:25.366 --> 08:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And at the conclusion
of that vetting review,
then the president can
decide whether he wants

08:29.900 --> 08:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to impose more or fewer travel
restrictions against different
countries around the country

08:33.800 --> 08:34.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - or world.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alan Gomez, USA Today,
Marcia Coyle, thank you both.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Judy.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.

08:42.466 --> 08:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news: The Supreme Court
also announced that it will

08:46.133 --> 08:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decide a case pitting gay
rights against religion.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At issue is whether
a Denver baker acted
legally when he refused
to sell a same-sex couple

08:55.866 --> 08:57.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a wedding cake.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He cited his religious beliefs.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In another case, the
justices ruled 7-2 that a
church-run school in Missouri
may seek taxpayer-funded

09:06.133 --> 09:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grants for a new playground.

09:09.300 --> 09:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has again
accused former President
Obama of failing to stop
Russian interference

09:15.033 --> 09:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the 2016 election.

09:17.133 --> 09:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Twitter today, he charged:
"The reason that President
Obama did nothing is that he

09:23.300 --> 09:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expected Hillary
Clinton would win.

09:24.666 --> 09:25.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He didn't choke.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He colluded or obstructed."

09:28.200 --> 09:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump insisted
investigators have no
evidence that his campaign
aides colluded with Russia.

09:35.133 --> 09:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British Prime Minister Theresa
May struck a deal with a
Northern Ireland party today

09:39.400 --> 09:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bolster her
minority government.

09:41.966 --> 09:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
May's Conservatives
lost their majority in
this month's election.

09:45.866 --> 09:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they have agreed to provide
some $1.3 billion in extra
funding to Northern Ireland.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's in return for the
Democratic Unionist Party's
10 votes in Parliament.

09:58.533 --> 10:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British officials now say that
75 high-rise buildings tested
for fire safety, have failed.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The testing began after
London's Grenfell Tower fire.

10:07.100 --> 10:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The siding on that building
may have fueled the blaze.

10:11.266 --> 10:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other buildings tested so
far are all over the country.

10:14.866 --> 10:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not clear how long it
will take to fix the problem.

10:18.066 --> 10:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In China: Nobel peace laureate
Liu Xiaobo has been released
from prison to a hospital

10:25.333 --> 10:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after being diagnosed with
late-stage liver cancer.

10:28.766 --> 10:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Liu has been a leading
dissident for decades.

10:31.433 --> 10:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2009, he was sentenced
to 11 years on a charge
of inciting subversion.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But his lawyer says that
today's release means little.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MO SHAOPING, Attorney for Liu
Xiaobo (through translator):
In principle, he will not be

10:43.733 --> 10:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed to see guests, or
visitors, because of the
special nature of his case.

10:47.833 --> 10:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under medical parole, a
person is still serving a
term while being treated
in a medical facility,

10:52.800 --> 10:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even if it's outside of prison.

10:54.666 --> 10:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Liu Xiaobo's case is special.

10:56.433 --> 10:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think the authorities
will allow him to have visitors.

10:59.166 --> 11:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Liu won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for
his efforts demanding greater

11:05.600 --> 11:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political freedoms and an end
to one-party rule in China.

Back in this country, the
family of Philando Castile has
reached a $3 million settlement

11:15.866 --> 11:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over his fatal shooting by
a Minnesota police officer.

11:18.533 --> 11:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Castile, a black man, was killed
during a traffic stop last year.

11:22.933 --> 11:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The officer was acquitted
this month of manslaughter
before being fired by
the city of St. Anthony.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Takata Corporation has filed
for bankruptcy protection over
faulty air bag inflators linked

11:35.566 --> 11:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to at least 16 deaths worldwide.

11:38.533 --> 11:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The company faces tens
of billions of dollars
in costs and liabilities
stemming from recalls

11:44.166 --> 11:46.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and lawsuits.

11:46.266 --> 11:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The filings today in the U.S.
and Japan clear the way for a
rival company to take over most

11:51.633 --> 11:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Takata's assets.

11:53.766 --> 11:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
14 points to close at 21409.

12:00.300 --> 12:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 18, and the
S&amp;P 500 added a fraction.

12:07.066 --> 12:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a crucial checkup for Republican
senators' health care

12:10.400 --> 12:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill; showing the Syrian
refugee crisis in a new light
through comic drawings; and much

12:17.133 --> 12:22.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a big day in the fight
over health care reform in the
United States and the Senate's

12:34.233 --> 12:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
push to replace Obamacare.

12:36.733 --> 12:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Yang digs in
to the details.

12:39.266 --> 12:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late today,
the Congressional Budget
Office issued its analysis
of the Senate health

12:43.033 --> 12:45.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care bill.

12:45.566 --> 12:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It found that, by 2026,
22 million more Americans
would be uninsured
than under current law.

12:51.166 --> 12:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would also reduce the
federal deficit by $321
billion over that period.

12:57.966 --> 13:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that estimate of uninsured
Americans is slightly lower
than the CBO projection

13:02.966 --> 13:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the House version,
which passed in May.

13:04.966 --> 13:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a rising tide of opposition
is adding to the difficult
dynamics of trying to pass

13:09.900 --> 13:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Senate bill this week.

13:12.033 --> 13:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joining me now to break all
this down, Julie Rovner.

13:14.533 --> 13:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the chief Washington
correspondent for
Kaiser Health Care News.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And our own Lisa Desjardins.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa, Julie, thanks
for joining us.

13:22.533 --> 13:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Julie, let me start with you.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Drill down a little bit for us
in that number of uninsured.

13:28.733 --> 13:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And also what did it say
about the effect on premiums?

13:31.500 --> 13:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health
News: Well, basically, what the
CBO said is that even though the

13:34.500 --> 13:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate bill is different in
many, many ways from the House
bill, they end up in roughly

13:38.833 --> 13:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the same place in terms
of number of people
who would be uninsured.

13:41.966 --> 13:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Basically, both of the bills
would double the percentage
of people without insurance

13:45.433 --> 13:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compared to the
Affordable Care Act.

13:47.633 --> 13:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the sort of remarkable
things that it found is that
it would do it for different

13:51.366 --> 13:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reasons and in different ways.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, the Senate bill
would peg its help with people
paying premiums to a less

13:59.633 --> 14:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
valuable plan, a plan
that would pay fewer of
people's medical expenses.

14:02.233 --> 14:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they found is that
for a lot of low-income
people, even if they get
help paying the premium,

14:06.066 --> 14:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they wouldn't buy insurance
because they wouldn't have any
help using their insurance.

14:09.066 --> 14:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The deductibles and
the other cost-sharing
would just be too high.

14:13.033 --> 14:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, you
were just on a conference
call with the CBO.

14:16.433 --> 14:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you learn?

14:17.933 --> 14:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that
is the standout point here.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know who these
uninsured people would be.

14:21.466 --> 14:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 22 million that you just
spoke about, John, those are
mostly low-income Americans

14:25.233 --> 14:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and some on the edge
of middle class.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're talking about $30,000
in income for an individual.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's not poverty.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's twice the
level of poverty.

14:33.066 --> 14:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CBO found here that some
of those groups, people making
under $30,000 a year, would

14:37.433 --> 14:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go from about 10 do 15 percent
uninsured, maybe 20 percent,
to maybe 40 percent of the

14:43.966 --> 14:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people making $30,000 or
less would be uninsured
under this plan.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's a big hit
to that one group.

14:49.700 --> 14:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, of
course, you're usually up
on Capitol Hill for us.

14:54.033 --> 14:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does this report do to
the calculus of trying to get
50 votes by the end of this

15:00.266 --> 15:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
week to pass this
bill in the Senate?

15:01.900 --> 15:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today
started, and it was
already very tough math.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, many of my sources all
day were saying they were not
sure how Senate Leader McConnell

15:07.500 --> 15:08.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could do it.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This makes it even
more difficult.

15:10.033 --> 15:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have had reaction
in just the last hour.

15:12.100 --> 15:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rand Paul has now said that
he's going to vote not just
against the bill, but to even

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the idea of bringing it up.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a procedural vote that
we expect maybe Wednesday
called motion to proceed.

15:22.166 --> 15:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they can't get 51 votes
for even starting this debate
on that bill, it's a very bad

15:26.833 --> 15:28.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sign.

15:28.733 --> 15:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing "makes me
concerned" comments from
Senator Cassidy of Louisiana.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John McCain said this is
obviously not good news.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Across the board,
this is definitely not
helping Republicans.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear how this
gets across the finish line.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, of course, the
51st vote would likely be the
vice president, who would break

15:41.800 --> 15:43.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a tie.

15:43.866 --> 15:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie, it wasn't just the CBO
that came out today, but there
were -- so there was other

15:47.500 --> 15:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad news for this
Senate bill today.

15:49.433 --> 15:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well,
there was also a plethora
of interest groups.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the health care industry
has actually come out and
said they really don't -- they

15:58.233 --> 16:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't like the way this -- the
direction this bill was going.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of them
vehemently oppose it.

16:02.766 --> 16:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some, including like the
National Governors Association
-- this is the bipartisan group

16:05.533 --> 16:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which is barely agrees
on anything -- at least
came out and said we
don't think it should

16:08.866 --> 16:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be done this fast.

16:10.966 --> 16:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The National Association
of Medicaid Directors,
the people who would
be involved in actually

16:14.400 --> 16:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
implementing the change to this
bill, came out with a very,
very strong statement saying

16:18.733 --> 16:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that no amount of flexibility
can make up for the dollar
amount of cuts to the Medicaid

16:22.866 --> 16:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
program in this bill.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
According to the CBO, it's
26 percent over 10 years.

16:26.866 --> 16:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And, Julie,
the Senate made a change
to this bill today.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What did they do and
why did they do it?

16:31.266 --> 16:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

16:33.733 --> 16:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate -- the original
Senate draft that we
saw last week required
insurers to continue

16:36.700 --> 16:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sell to people who have
preexisting health conditions,
but there was nothing in it to

16:40.733 --> 16:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encourage or urge healthy people
to actually buy insurance.

16:45.233 --> 16:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they put in today or at
least what the CBO scored what
they call a six-month lockout.

16:52.233 --> 16:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you had any kind of break
in coverage of more than 60
days in the previous 12 months,

16:57.900 --> 16:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you would have to wait six
months before you could get
coverage under this new bill.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, Lisa, you say
we need 50 votes in the Senate.

17:02.300 --> 17:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got five already
saying they're against it.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have got a lot on the fence.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who should we be watching?

17:09.766 --> 17:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who will tell us in the
next 48 hours whether or
not this is going to pass?

17:12.433 --> 17:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right
now, almost every
Republican senator is key.

17:15.166 --> 17:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the one I'm watching the
most closely is Senator Shelley
Capito of West Virginia.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Think about her state.

17:22.433 --> 17:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Trump, President Trump,
won that state by 42 points.

17:25.533 --> 17:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he cannot get a bill across
the finish line in a state
with that much support, there's

17:30.233 --> 17:32.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a real problem.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has serious health
problems in that state, among
them, the opioid epidemic.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She wants more money
in this bill for that.

17:37.266 --> 17:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see if she gets it.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that might not be enough.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She has a huge
Medicaid population.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's not the only one, John.

17:43.466 --> 17:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really ran a lot of
the statistics here.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Think about this.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost half of the Republicans
in the Senate have states
where 20 percent of their whole

17:50.900 --> 17:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
population is on Medicaid.

17:52.766 --> 17:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something they're taking
very seriously with this bill.

17:54.733 --> 17:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Julie, are we likely
to see more changes in this
bill as they try to get to

17:58.233 --> 17:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that 50-vote mark?

17:59.233 --> 18:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Oh, absolutely.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing that the CBO -- I
guess one piece of good news
for the Republican in the Senate

18:04.333 --> 18:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the Senate bill
would save considerably more
money than the House bill.

18:07.766 --> 18:09.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, in theory, they
have money to play with.

18:09.766 --> 18:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would expect more money
to be devoting towards
helping the opioid epidemic.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They could make more changes.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem, the difficulty
is that any change
that moves towards the
more moderate numbers

18:20.533 --> 18:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will harden the opposition,
the more conservative,
and any change that
make the conservatives

18:24.400 --> 18:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happy will harden the
opposition of the moderates.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, question, they only
have two votes to spare.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Finding 50 votes,
not an easy thing.

18:31.166 --> 18:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, it will be a
drama all week as we get toward
Friday and the self-imposed

18:35.266 --> 18:36.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deadline.

18:36.633 --> 18:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie Rovner, Lisa Desjardins,
thank you very much.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.

18:38.766 --> 18:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
thank you, John.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as we have heard, a number
of patient groups and major
players in the health care

18:44.300 --> 18:46.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry have opposed
the Senate bill.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Every major hospital
group has criticized it.

18:50.033 --> 18:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say they are especially
worried about deep reductions
in Medicaid spending for the

18:54.500 --> 18:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
poor and those with
disabilities, changes
that include new limits
like spending caps

18:59.366 --> 19:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or block grants that would
eventually cut the number
of people on Medicaid.

19:04.266 --> 19:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hospitals say they will end
up paying the difference
by treating the uninsured.

19:08.533 --> 19:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While I was in Colorado for the
Aspen Spotlight Health Festival
last week, I spoke with Kenneth

19:13.333 --> 19:15.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Davis.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's president and CEO of the
Mount Sinai Health System,
which includes seven hospitals

19:20.933 --> 19:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and more than 140
ambulatory centers and
practices in New York.

19:24.233 --> 19:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Ken Davis, thank you very
much for talking with us.

19:28.733 --> 19:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were quoted recently as
commenting on the House version
of the Republican overhaul

19:33.666 --> 19:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Affordable Care Act.

19:35.366 --> 19:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You said it would have
a fairly devastating
effect on the country.

19:41.533 --> 19:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that the way you feel
about the Senate version too?

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS, President
and CEO, Mount Sinai
Health System: Absolutely.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, if anything, there are
aspects of the Senate bill that
can be even more problematic.

19:48.733 --> 19:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Particularly, the glide path
to per capita or block grants
is going to produce a lower

19:55.633 --> 19:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reimbursement for the states
than was even in the House bill.

19:58.633 --> 20:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about
the effect on hospitals?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well, there
are a number of things
that impact hospitals.

20:05.266 --> 20:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of them collectively,
particularly for hospitals that
have a reasonable number of

20:09.733 --> 20:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid patients,
are pretty difficult.

20:12.433 --> 20:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are substantial cuts.

20:15.033 --> 20:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For instance, the public
hospitals -- the Health and
Hospital Corporation in New York

20:19.266 --> 20:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
City, they can't possibly
sustain these cuts to
the Medicaid budget.

20:23.366 --> 20:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Other hospitals that
have a large number of
Medicaid patients have
a very tiny margin.

20:29.466 --> 20:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That margin evaporates
with this bill.

20:32.033 --> 20:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is that
-- even with tweaking,
you're saying there's
literally no way around?

20:36.933 --> 20:39.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

20:39.033 --> 20:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well,
fundamentally, this
bill is about decreasing
Medicaid and decreasing

20:41.233 --> 20:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what states receive for
Medicaid and decreasing,
in the House case, those
who have the extended

20:47.366 --> 20:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
benefits or the eligibility that
they previously didn't have.

20:52.933 --> 20:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The bill isn't that much
around tweaks to Obamacare.

20:55.566 --> 20:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a little bit.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a bit to tweak the
exchanges, but the money's
coming from Medicaid.

21:00.966 --> 21:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And unless they take
a completely different
approach to Medicaid,
I don't see that tweaks

21:04.433 --> 21:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are going to help.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there are
observers of the health care
system who look at all this,

21:08.400 --> 21:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they say hospitals are
a big part of the problem.

21:11.233 --> 21:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're consolidating.

21:12.233 --> 21:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are mergers.

21:13.966 --> 21:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Doctors are cutting
deal with hospitals.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody's making more money.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hospitals are charging more.

21:20.333 --> 21:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What could hospitals do that
they aren't doing now to get
some of these costs down?

21:24.966 --> 21:26.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well,
let's remember all
hospitals are not alike.

21:28.166 --> 21:32.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In many cases, geography
is destiny in hospitals.

21:32.233 --> 21:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if you're in a system like
ours, in which the vast majority
of our payments are either

21:36.633 --> 21:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid or Medicare,
that's fixed.

21:39.733 --> 21:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the size of our hospital
system isn't going to change
how much Medicaid reimbursement

21:43.733 --> 21:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or Medicare
reimbursement we get.

21:46.500 --> 21:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Additionally, as some systems
have increased in size, they
have done so in order that they

21:53.100 --> 21:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
can move away from
fee-for-service medicine
to what's called value.

21:56.233 --> 22:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To do that, to be a system
that can take risk and value,
you have to be large enough so

22:02.500 --> 22:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that patients don't
escape your network.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's part of the thing
that is driving consolidation.

22:06.933 --> 22:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is enough
being done, you think,
to be mindful of costs?

22:10.600 --> 22:12.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:12.633 --> 22:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well, the margins
in many hospitals are so small
that, if you are not fixated

22:17.466 --> 22:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on costs, you are bankrupt.

22:19.566 --> 22:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in New York state, we
have seen 30-plus hospitals
go bankrupt in recent years.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So the lesson is?

22:25.633 --> 22:27.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

22:27.133 --> 22:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: The lesson is,
we are focused on expenses.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to be
fixated on expenses.

22:30.500 --> 22:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we really need to do
-- and we were trying to do
this previously -- and hopefully

22:34.033 --> 22:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can continue to do this
-- is ask, how can we deliver
health care in a different,

22:37.766 --> 22:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more efficient,
cost-efficient way?

22:40.233 --> 22:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The system is failing us.

22:42.733 --> 22:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The macroeconomics of
health care are such
that the government can't
afford it, the states

22:46.266 --> 22:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't afford it, the employers
can't afford it, and the
employees can't afford it.

22:49.800 --> 22:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we have got to ask is,
what's wrong with the system
and how do we change it so that

22:54.200 --> 22:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's more efficient
for everybody?

22:56.066 --> 22:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You
brought up Medicaid.

22:57.633 --> 23:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were saying how much of this
legislation is around Medicaid.

23:01.066 --> 23:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many who say that
the Medicaid expansion that
was part of the Affordable
Care Act originally,

23:08.533 --> 23:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I know you were
strongly for, the critics
say this was simply throwing
money at an inefficient

23:13.900 --> 23:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program, poor-quality care,
people on Medicaid don't get the
same level of care that others

23:19.666 --> 23:21.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

23:21.633 --> 23:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they point to studies
showing that, even with the
expansion of Medicaid, that that

23:27.566 --> 23:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care is not getting much better.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you respond?

23:30.366 --> 23:32.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Well, those
studies or study doesn't
take a very long perspective.

23:35.933 --> 23:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't see the difference
in things like mortality
for quite some time.

23:40.600 --> 23:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you're lowering
people's hemoglobin A1c
or better controlling
their blood pressure,

23:47.633 --> 23:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it can take sometimes years
before you see an extension of
a lifespan in those patients.

23:52.966 --> 23:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we did find,
what was reported was an
improvement in mental health.

23:57.633 --> 24:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it seems like people
have forgotten that.

24:00.600 --> 24:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The largest provider of
payment for addiction
services is Medicaid.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty percent of all Medicaid
recipients, at the very least,
have mental health problems.

24:13.500 --> 24:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To take that out of the equation
is very, very destructive.

24:17.700 --> 24:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to think that we're not
having a positive influence --
because the only thing we really

24:21.766 --> 24:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
directly affect and that
we can measure short-term
is improvement in mental
health -- is a little

24:26.233 --> 24:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demeaning to our psychiatrists.

24:28.300 --> 24:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me go back
to the mega-question about our
whole -- our health care system.

24:34.233 --> 24:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What conservatives are arguing,
among other things, is that
when you have health care,

24:39.866 --> 24:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rising costs of health care
driving at least a sixth of the
economy, that something's really

24:44.500 --> 24:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of whack, that the whole
system is too expensive,
too out of control.

24:51.066 --> 24:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Government participating
in it is helping to
drive up those costs.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do they have a point?

24:55.333 --> 24:56.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Not really.

24:58.366 --> 25:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We lose money on every Medicaid
patient who walks through our
door, whether it's inpatient

25:01.833 --> 25:02.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or outpatient.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the cost of health care.

25:04.900 --> 25:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they were truly interested
in the question of why is our
system so expensive, this would

25:11.266 --> 25:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a bill about how we move
away from fee-for-service
medicine, in which
physicians and hospitals

25:16.566 --> 25:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get paid for everything they
do, and moving more toward value
and risk, in which patients,

25:21.866 --> 25:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
providers are all aligned, such
that everyone wants you to stay
well and out of the hospital.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We would have more incentives
for readmission penalties.

25:29.633 --> 25:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We would have incentives
for shorter stay.

25:32.033 --> 25:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would have more incentives to
bring care to a less expensive
place, like the ambulatory

25:37.500 --> 25:38.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
setting.

25:38.933 --> 25:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But those issues aren't
being addressed in this bill.

25:41.566 --> 25:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And your
point is conservatives may
make that argument, but
they're not promoting...

25:45.033 --> 25:47.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

25:47.066 --> 25:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: If they are
truly interested in changing
the cost structure, making it

25:50.633 --> 25:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more efficient and less
expensive, they have
got to deal with reforms
that actually affect

25:56.233 --> 25:57.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those metrics.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And these don't.

25:59.233 --> 26:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Ken Davis,
we thank you very much.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:04.866 --> 26:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH DAVIS: Thank you.

26:12.433 --> 26:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:16.966 --> 26:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the first part of my interview
with Warren Buffett on the

26:21.066 --> 26:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation's shifting economy;
and it's Politics Monday --
Tamara Keith and Stu Rothenberg

26:27.533 --> 26:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look ahead to a busy
week on the Hill.

26:30.100 --> 26:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: a unique look at
the victims of war in Syria.

26:35.066 --> 26:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2015, Canada began
that country's largest
refugee resettlement
program since the Vietnam

26:41.500 --> 26:43.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

26:43.566 --> 26:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the last year-and-a-half,
45,000 Syrian refugees have
made Canada their home, more

26:48.666 --> 26:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than double those
admitted in the U.S.

26:50.766 --> 26:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a group of comic book
artists are documenting refugee
stories through their art.

26:57.700 --> 27:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Stefan
Labbe and producer Lauren
Kaljur have the story.

27:03.766 --> 27:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: In 2011,
Mohammed Alsaleh joined
the wave of anti-government
protesters sweeping

27:12.533 --> 27:14.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across Syria.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH, Syrian
Immigrant: It was the first
time in my life where I hear my

27:16.133 --> 27:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voice saying the word
freedom in public.

27:19.300 --> 27:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first time in Syrian
history where a picture of
our dictator is being torn in

27:26.833 --> 27:27.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
public.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I was taking that shot.

27:29.800 --> 27:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was one of the most
amazing days of my life.

27:36.766 --> 27:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: That footage
would prove his undoing, as
the government began to crack

27:42.300 --> 27:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down on protesters.

27:43.933 --> 27:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: Now
they are attacking us.

27:50.966 --> 27:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Now a refugee in
Canada, Mohammed finally has
the chance to tell his story,

27:56.333 --> 27:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the help of a nonprofit
graphic arts collective.

27:59.300 --> 28:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHON DALTON, Comic
Book Artist: Cloudscape
finds people who have
come to Canada as refugees

28:05.466 --> 28:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and matches them with
comic book artists.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Jonathon Dalton
is an established comic artist.

28:10.100 --> 28:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He usually draws stories about
fantasy and historical fiction.

28:13.733 --> 28:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this time, Mohammed's
life is on the page, a story
that begins with revolution.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: I was studying
medicine at Homs University
during the Arab Spring.

28:30.500 --> 28:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The first time I was
arrested was for filming
pro-democracy protests.

28:36.933 --> 28:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, protesters would have
a flag with three stars.

28:39.133 --> 28:40.400 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JONATHON DALTON:
Three stars, OK.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wasn't paying close
enough attention.

28:42.466 --> 28:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: With funding from
the government, the comic book
artists will work closely with

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refugees to create a
massive one-page comic.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHON DALTON: This is
your story, so I want you to
have as much control over how

28:53.566 --> 28:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's told as possible.

28:56.133 --> 29:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: When they're
finished, the refugees'
story will be displayed
in bus shelters all

29:01.800 --> 29:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over Vancouver, Canada.

29:04.666 --> 29:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHON DALTON: By drawing
people as cartoons, I
think you can engage the
reader to see themselves

29:14.533 --> 29:16.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the story.

29:16.533 --> 29:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: But it's about
more than putting yourself
in a refugee's shoes.

29:19.166 --> 29:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Mohammed, comics have the
power to animate a humanitarian
crisis many have grown numb

29:24.633 --> 29:26.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

29:26.666 --> 29:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When you
try your best to share a story
about the worst crisis after

29:32.600 --> 29:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World War II, sometimes, you
feel that language is not
actually capable of doing that.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONATHON DALTON: I think
that's what I drew.

29:40.800 --> 29:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: After shooting the
protest footage, Mohammed had
no idea his future would take

29:45.100 --> 29:46.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a dark turn.

29:46.766 --> 29:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: I
tried my best to say
out of trouble, but...

29:50.100 --> 29:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Assad's security
forces stormed Mohammed's
classroom as he was writing an

29:55.066 --> 29:56.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exam.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was charged with terrorism
for documenting the uprising.

29:58.933 --> 30:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: Those pictures
that I was able to upload
were all over the news, all

30:05.166 --> 30:07.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over the world.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Mohammed
was blindfolded and
shuttled off to one of the
regime's many detention

30:10.933 --> 30:12.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
centers.

30:12.966 --> 30:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the next 150 days, the
guards would deprive him of food
and sleep, chain him from the

30:18.100 --> 30:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ceiling and beat him
inside of a tire.

30:22.466 --> 30:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he wasn't being
tortured, he was crammed into
small rooms with dozens of other

30:27.400 --> 30:28.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prisoners.

30:28.633 --> 30:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH:
I survived, yes.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They managed to change me.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They managed to terrorize me.

30:41.033 --> 30:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: Mohammed was
released from prison when
his brother bribed a judge.

30:44.233 --> 30:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When I got
my freedom back, all I wanted
to do was see my family.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I also wanted to say goodbye.

30:53.333 --> 30:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I needed to get as
far away as I could.

30:56.766 --> 31:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: He jumped into
a taxi and fled to Lebanon.

31:00.900 --> 31:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When you're
on survival mode, like where
you're not whole, it was

31:08.500 --> 31:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of that, that I
decided to leave Syria.

31:12.900 --> 31:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was because of that I decided
that I'm not going to risk
being detained and tortured

31:19.633 --> 31:21.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

31:21.766 --> 31:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEFAN LABBE: He would soon be
chosen as one of the first 200
Syrian refugees to be granted

31:26.366 --> 31:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asylum in Canada.

31:28.433 --> 31:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: When I
arrived in Vancouver, I had
only the clothes on my back.

31:34.033 --> 31:37.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEFAN LABBE: Three
years on, he's built a
life for himself here.

31:37.433 --> 31:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now Mohammed helps other
refugees newly arrived
in the city, people like
Osama, who just arrived

31:43.833 --> 31:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from Syria with his
wife and four kids.

31:46.566 --> 31:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Today, Mohammed is
helping them start over.

31:49.333 --> 31:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He signs them up for health
insurance, helps them open a
bank account, and teaches them

31:58.233 --> 32:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how to withdraw
money from an ATM.

32:00.966 --> 32:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: Withdraw.

32:03.066 --> 32:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEFAN LABBE: But with
the cartoon project, he
wants to reach beyond
the refugee community.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMED ALSALEH: I think it's
very important to, you know,
share my story, other immigrants

32:16.400 --> 32:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to share their stories as well,
in order to demonstrate we have
this beautiful place because

32:24.500 --> 32:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we welcome others, because
we are the positive example
in a -- in a very bad world.

32:33.533 --> 32:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEFAN LABBE: With his
family scattered across
Turkey and Germany, and
anti-immigrant movements

32:40.366 --> 32:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the size, Mohammed is
focused on one thing, reuniting
his family here in Canada.

32:47.300 --> 32:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Stefan Labbe in Vancouver.

32:53.933 --> 32:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, to
part one of my interview
with Warren Buffett.

33:04.100 --> 33:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's one of the shrewdest and
most successful investors in
the world, earning the nickname

33:08.800 --> 33:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Oracle of Omaha.

33:10.733 --> 33:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I traveled to Nebraska
last week for this
wide-ranging conversation.

33:15.066 --> 33:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a note: Buffett is CBO of
Berkshire Hathaway, which owns
BNSF Railway, one of the funders

33:21.400 --> 33:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the "NewsHour."

33:23.933 --> 33:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's number two on Forbes'
list of the world's
wealthiest people, worth
more than $75 billion.

33:31.800 --> 33:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warren Buffett is an
investing rock star to
his Berkshire Hathaway
shareholders, who gather

33:37.533 --> 33:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Omaha every year.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One share is trading
today at $251,000.

33:43.933 --> 33:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two years ago, the legendary
firm celebrated its record of
investment over a half-century,

33:51.100 --> 33:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a portfolio that includes Kraft
Heinz, Geico, Wells Fargo,
Coca-Cola and, among others,

33:58.733 --> 34:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Nebraska Furniture Mart.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the largest furniture
store in North America.

34:04.800 --> 34:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Buffet bought it in 1983
from Rose Blumkin, a
Russian immigrant who
built it from nothing.

34:11.733 --> 34:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman
and CEO, Berkshire Hathaway:
There's nothing like it.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're the 58th market in the
United States, and this was the
largest home furnishing store

34:16.066 --> 34:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the country, until
we built two more.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why
was she so successful?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was the secret?

34:22.833 --> 34:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: She would say --
she had a thing in her office,
which you probably couldn't

34:28.700 --> 34:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read, but it says she
had two things, sell
cheap and tell the truth.

34:31.300 --> 34:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We talked on the
showroom floor surrounded by
sofas, lamps and coffee tables.

34:37.833 --> 34:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The state of the economy
was our first topic.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The stock market's booming.

34:43.433 --> 34:48.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Unemployment rate is,
what, is as low as it's
been in 15, 16 years.

34:48.033 --> 34:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're still not
seeing the growth that
people would like to see.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

34:54.166 --> 34:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: The economy
is doing well, but all
Americans aren't doing well.

34:56.333 --> 35:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have got $57,000 or
$58,000 of GDP per person.

35:02.766 --> 35:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a lot of stuff.

35:04.733 --> 35:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet
the growth, the rate of
growth is, what, 2 percent.

35:08.233 --> 35:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes, 2 percent.

35:10.333 --> 35:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is saying we're going to get
it up a lot higher than that.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that doable?

35:14.933 --> 35:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it may
be occasionally it happens.

35:17.033 --> 35:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, no, I don't think
probably on average we will
have that kind of growth.

35:20.666 --> 35:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But 2 percent does
wonders for you, Judy.

35:23.300 --> 35:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you take 2 percent,
we have a half-a-percent
population growth, and we
have a little immigration,

35:27.300 --> 35:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but 2 percent in one generation
will add $19,000 of GDP per
person, family of four, $76,000

35:36.533 --> 35:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in one generation.

35:38.600 --> 35:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, your children and
your children's children
and all that, they
will live far, far, far

35:43.700 --> 35:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better than we live
with 2 percent growth.

35:45.766 --> 35:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
then ask you a little bit about
the employment picture, because

35:49.033 --> 35:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is, as you ISIS
, low unemployment.

35:51.633 --> 35:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People -- a lot of
people have jobs.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, we're
told the labor participation
rate is lower than what
the experts like it

36:00.366 --> 36:01.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More people are
leaving jobs than are joining.

36:04.366 --> 36:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are we seeing some
kind of shift?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we always
see shifts in employment.

36:09.266 --> 36:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think about it, if you go
back to 1800, it took 80 percent
of the labor force to produce

36:14.633 --> 36:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enough food for the country.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now it takes less
than 3 percent.

36:19.166 --> 36:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the truth is that market
systems move people around.

36:22.800 --> 36:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also see,
though, some experts saying
that not enough -- there aren't

36:27.533 --> 36:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough workers out there who
know -- who have the skills to
do all the jobs that are needed.

36:33.933 --> 36:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well,
there's always a mismatch.

36:35.566 --> 36:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, you know, as
the economy evolves, it
reallocates resources.

36:42.466 --> 36:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the real problem, in my
view, is -- this has been -- the
prosperity has been unbelievable

36:47.166 --> 36:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the extremely rich people.

36:49.900 --> 36:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you go to 1982, when Forbes
put on their first 400 list,
those people had $93 billion.

36:56.733 --> 37:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They now they have $2.4
trillion, 25 for one.

37:01.066 --> 37:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is -- this has
been a prosperity that's
been disproportionately
rewarding to the people

37:07.266 --> 37:08.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on top.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are we
stuck forever with some
measure inequality?

37:11.033 --> 37:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: No, we generally
have translated greater output
in the few hours of work per

37:18.500 --> 37:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
week over the last century.

37:21.233 --> 37:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's a good
trend of the future.

37:23.500 --> 37:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do have to have a system
that, as output of goods and
services keeps increasing per

37:30.500 --> 37:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capita, that it takes care of
the people who are willing to
work and really are not getting

37:34.566 --> 37:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by very well with a
family on a 40-hour week.

37:37.533 --> 37:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You come
across as optimistic about
the future of this country.

37:41.833 --> 37:44.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:44.433 --> 37:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think you
wrote to your shareholders
last year it's been a
mistake to bet against

37:45.666 --> 37:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States for
the last 240 years.

37:48.866 --> 37:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has the U.S. standing, though,
in the world been -- has it
been changed, has it been harmed

37:55.833 --> 37:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in any way, given what's
been going on for the
last six or eight months?

37:59.066 --> 38:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: We do not
have quite the percentage
of the world's GDP
that we had 20 or 30 or

38:05.166 --> 38:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
40 years ago, but
we're still the leader.

38:07.266 --> 38:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether we
can be the moral leader, as
well as the economic leader.

38:10.266 --> 38:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
what do you think?

38:12.133 --> 38:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well,
I think that's a podium
that we should have.

38:14.800 --> 38:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will be the economic
leader, and we should
be the moral leader.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We should stand for more
than the fact that we're
the wealthiest country.

38:23.633 --> 38:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you
think we are right now?

38:25.733 --> 38:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, sometimes,
we are and sometimes we aren't.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:30.433 --> 38:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I didn't think
what happened on the Paris
agreement was a good idea.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to live with
the rest of the world.

38:36.533 --> 38:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a mistake, in my view.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trade has generally
developed in this country.

38:41.633 --> 38:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We actually export 12 or
13 percent of our GDP.

38:44.633 --> 38:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was only 5 percent in 1970.

38:46.766 --> 38:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it benefits us.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It benefits the
rest of the world.

38:49.466 --> 38:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't benefit the
steelworker maybe in Ohio.

38:51.833 --> 38:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the problem that has
to be addressed, because when
you have something that's good

38:55.566 --> 39:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for society, but terribly
harmful for given individuals,
we have got to make sure those

39:00.133 --> 39:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individuals are taken care of.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask
you about a couple questions
about markets, investing.

39:05.533 --> 39:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, nobody knows
markets better than you do.

39:08.500 --> 39:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you said earlier this
year that you weren't worried
that the market was in a bubble,

39:12.200 --> 39:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because interest rates
were staying low.

39:14.833 --> 39:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As you know, the Federal Reserve
is starting to raise them.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you still feel the
market is not in a bubble?

39:19.700 --> 39:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, anything
can happen in markets.

39:21.433 --> 39:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I bought my first stock in
1942, in the summer of '42.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was 11 years old.

39:26.866 --> 39:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so 75 years have gone by.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I have never known
what the market's going
to do the next day.

39:32.866 --> 39:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's not my game.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My game is to decide whether
I'm in the right economy, which
America's definitely been ever

39:38.600 --> 39:39.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since that time.

39:39.833 --> 39:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Dow has gone from
121000 during that time.

39:42.733 --> 39:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no matter what the headlines
say, or terrible things are
happening -- we were losing the

39:49.033 --> 39:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
war in the Pacific when
I first bought stocks.

39:53.133 --> 39:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, America's going
to do fine over time.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America business is going
to do fine over time.

39:58.666 --> 40:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Occasionally, we go off the
tracks with bubbles like -- and
a lot of human error and that

40:04.266 --> 40:05.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of thing.

40:05.466 --> 40:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it will never
permanently derail us.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't try and guess when
to get in and out of the market.

40:10.133 --> 40:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have owned stocks
consistently since 1942.

40:12.500 --> 40:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I owned the -- I was
buying stocks the day
before the election.

40:16.100 --> 40:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was buying the same stocks
the day after election.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if Hillary had been
elected, it would have
been the same thing.

40:21.200 --> 40:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does President
Trump deserve credit for what
is going on right now in the

40:25.233 --> 40:27.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
market?

40:27.266 --> 40:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: I -- the
stock market has been going up
basically since March of 2009.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's when it hit the
bottom, very early in March.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been going up more
or less ever since then.

40:37.633 --> 40:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if I ever get elected
president, I will never claim
credit for anything the market

40:40.866 --> 40:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does, because I don't
want to be blamed when it
goes the other direction.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your investment
decisions over time have been
remarkably right much of the

40:50.933 --> 40:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time, most of the time.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, as people look at you
and look at the decisions that
you have made, what mainly

40:57.000 --> 40:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should people take a look at?

40:58.533 --> 41:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: They should
be willing to bet on America.

41:00.700 --> 41:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They shouldn't listen to a lot
of jabbering about what the
market's going to do tomorrow

41:03.333 --> 41:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or next week or next month,
because nobody knows.

41:05.800 --> 41:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They should just keep buying
and buying and buying a little
bit of America as they go

41:10.033 --> 41:11.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
along.

41:11.533 --> 41:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And 30 or 40 years from now,
they will have a lot of money.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Berkshire
Hathaway has made a huge
investment in Wells Fargo.

41:15.433 --> 41:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: True.

41:17.500 --> 41:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
-- it came up at your
recent shareholders
meeting that Wells Fargo

41:22.366 --> 41:23.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had problems.

41:23.666 --> 41:25.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They engaged in some...

41:25.066 --> 41:26.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT:
Plenty of problems.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Plenty of problems.

41:28.166 --> 41:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They engaged in some fake
accounts, in millions
of fake accounts.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The leadership of the
company was replaced.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

41:34.900 --> 41:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The critics are
saying, yes, you called them
out, but Berkshire Hathaway

41:39.933 --> 41:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still owns a big
chunk of Wells Fargo.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.

41:43.666 --> 41:45.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

41:45.233 --> 41:46.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
they're saying, is
there a double standard?

41:46.500 --> 41:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: It was
a terrible mistake.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They incentivized bad behavior.

41:49.566 --> 41:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Incentives work, but they
work -- you incentivize good
behavior or bad behavior.

41:53.600 --> 41:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the problem,
big problem is -- and
sometimes will you -- you
can design an incentive

41:59.933 --> 42:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system that is incentivizing
the wrong things.

42:01.533 --> 42:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to end it, and
end it fast and decisive.

42:04.133 --> 42:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's where they
made the big mistake.

42:06.200 --> 42:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a clear
line in your mind when behavior
becomes just so unacceptable

42:12.266 --> 42:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that you don't want
to have anything to
do with that company?

42:13.766 --> 42:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it's
a very interesting question.

42:16.066 --> 42:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't want to
manufacture cigarettes.

42:20.533 --> 42:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But if I owned -- we
do own ®MDNMostco.

42:26.266 --> 42:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do they sell them?

42:27.533 --> 42:29.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I don't have a problem
owning stock in that.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I just wouldn't want to --
I wouldn't want to do it myself.

42:34.433 --> 42:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I basically think, if
anything is sufficiently
antisocial, society
should do something about

42:38.333 --> 42:39.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

42:39.333 --> 42:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's a separate question.

42:41.300 --> 42:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But -- and I don't think
there's any company that I have
seen that's 100 percent pure.

42:44.800 --> 42:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of what I will call
them out for, I will call
individuals out, but generally

42:48.733 --> 42:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I would not apply that
to the corporation.

42:50.866 --> 42:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something that
affects all businesses is the
cost of health care in this

42:54.500 --> 42:55.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Right.

42:56.966 --> 42:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
have been vocal about that.

42:59.100 --> 43:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have argued that, right
now, in effect, that the cost
of paying for health care can

43:05.066 --> 43:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
affect a company
even more than taxes.

43:07.100 --> 43:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it
does, I mean, in terms of our
competitiveness in the world.

43:11.700 --> 43:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Health care in 1960
was 5 percent of GDP.

43:16.266 --> 43:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there's only 100
cents in the dollar.

43:17.966 --> 43:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's gone from 5 cents
-- 5 percent to 17 percent.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it keeps going up.

43:24.833 --> 43:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corporate taxes have gone down
from 4 percent to 2 percent.

43:28.733 --> 43:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, corporate taxes are
way less of a factor in
American competitiveness
than -- I'm talking

43:34.933 --> 43:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about overall business
-- than medical costs.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as
we sit here today in
Omaha, the Republicans
in Congress are madly

43:42.866 --> 43:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to figure out what
to do to replace Obamacare,
the Affordable Care Act.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: Yes.

43:50.733 --> 43:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you
have a firm idea in your
mind of what ought to
be done about Obamacare?

43:53.633 --> 43:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everybody acknowledges there
have been some problems with it.

43:55.833 --> 43:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WARREN BUFFETT: I think
that's way outside of
my circle of competence.

43:59.566 --> 44:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I would say this.

44:02.200 --> 44:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't have that 5 go to
17 and move on to 20 and 22
or 24 percent, because there

44:08.900 --> 44:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are only 100 cents in a dollar.

44:10.566 --> 44:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And health care is gobbling up
well over $3 trillion a year.

44:17.533 --> 44:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just about the same
as federal -- the federal
budget is getting up there.

44:23.033 --> 44:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are we now at
the point where the country
does need to think about some

44:25.433 --> 44:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of single-payer system
in some form or another?

44:28.100 --> 44:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: With my
limited knowledge, I think that
probably is the best system,

44:34.533 --> 44:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it is a system --
we are such a rich country.

44:37.233 --> 44:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In a sense, we can
afford to do it.

44:39.400 --> 44:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in almost every field
of American business, it
pays to bring down costs.

44:46.400 --> 44:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's an awful lot of people
involved in the medical --
the whole -- just the way the

44:49.533 --> 44:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ecosystem works, that
there is no incentive
to bring down costs.

44:53.033 --> 44:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it
sounds like you're saying,
with a single-payer
system, it would be easier

44:56.066 --> 44:57.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to figure out a way to
get those costs down.

44:57.533 --> 44:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: It would
be more effective, I think.

44:59.566 --> 45:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in
tomorrow night for the second
part of my conversation with

45:03.200 --> 45:05.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Warren Buffett.

45:05.233 --> 45:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will look then more at his
own taxes and his views on
tax reform and philanthropy.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Online, you can view Buffett's
very first tax return, filed
when he just 14 years old

45:16.833 --> 45:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for money he earned delivering
newspapers in his then Northwest
Washington, D.C., neighborhood.

45:21.433 --> 45:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

45:41.733 --> 45:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We turn back now to the Supreme
Court's decision to take up the
Trump administration's travel

45:46.633 --> 45:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ban and the ongoing
fight over the health
care replacement bill.

45:50.900 --> 45:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all that, it's time for
politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Stu Rothenberg,

45:57.233 --> 45:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
senior editor at
Inside Elections.

45:59.866 --> 46:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

46:01.966 --> 46:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tam, I'm going to start
with you on the Supreme Court
ruling on the travel ban.

46:04.933 --> 46:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is a limited victory
for the president.

46:07.233 --> 46:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They did allow a
reinstatement of a part of it.

46:10.700 --> 46:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much of a victory is it?

46:12.200 --> 46:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well, it's a victory.

46:13.833 --> 46:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the president hasn't
had a lot of victories
on this travel ban.

46:17.433 --> 46:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been blocked in
various courts all the way
up to the Supreme Court.

46:21.500 --> 46:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was 0-2 in the appeals
courts before getting
to the Supreme Court.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now at least he will be
heard in the Supreme Court.

46:30.033 --> 46:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, it is not the 9-0 victory
that the president declared.

46:34.566 --> 46:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's not a decision yet.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's only a decision
to hear the case.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you see it, Stu?

46:39.533 --> 46:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside
Elections: Yes, similarly.

46:41.233 --> 46:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I guess everything is a
win or loss, so it's a
win for the president.

46:44.700 --> 46:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see it having dramatic
political implications, frankly.

46:47.700 --> 46:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the lines
have been drawn.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're either for the
ban or against the ban.

46:52.333 --> 46:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To some extent, the
final decision has been
kicked down the road,
the can has been kicked

46:56.133 --> 46:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down the road a bit.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's a
win for the president.

46:59.600 --> 47:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But compared to health care,
foreign policy, jobs, the
economy, I just don't see it as

47:05.533 --> 47:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a decisive issue.

47:07.566 --> 47:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, so
speaking of health care, we know
the debate in the Senate goes

47:12.066 --> 47:14.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

47:14.100 --> 47:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard Lisa Desjardins, Julie
Rovner talking with John Yang
earlier talking about where

47:17.233 --> 47:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the state of play is.

47:19.333 --> 47:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Tam, the Congressional
Budget Office weighed in with
-- and saying almost as many

47:25.566 --> 47:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - 22 million more Americans
would be hurt by this plan,
would lose coverage, which is

47:30.400 --> 47:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
almost as many as
the House plan.

47:32.466 --> 47:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you have just heard
there's some reaction to
that from the White House.

47:34.566 --> 47:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

47:36.566 --> 47:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House is reacting
much the way that it reacted
the last time the Congressional

47:39.033 --> 47:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office came out with
one of these blockbuster
reports saying millions
of people would lose

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're saying is that
the CBO hasn't always been
accurate and estimating health

47:47.000 --> 47:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care, so, all right, everyone,
just look in the other
direction, please ignore that.

47:53.866 --> 47:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other point that the
statement makes is that the
president said he would repeal

47:56.500 --> 48:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and replace the Affordable Care
Act, and this bill does it,
and, therefore, that's what

48:01.333 --> 48:03.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they want.

48:03.333 --> 48:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there are some in the
Senate who actually say the bill
doesn't repeal Obamacare, it's

48:06.766 --> 48:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more of a modification of the
preexisting structure, and
that is one of the objections.

48:13.766 --> 48:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are many out there.

48:15.300 --> 48:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, what is
the political state of play?

48:17.300 --> 48:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the pressures on these
Republicans as they try to
decide what to do about this?

48:21.133 --> 48:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, I think
they're in a very difficult
position, a rock and a hard

48:25.533 --> 48:26.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

48:26.766 --> 48:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On one hand, they want
to accomplish something.

48:28.766 --> 48:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a mandate from
conservatives, Republicans,
Trump backers to do something.

48:35.600 --> 48:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, they're
concerned about opinion back
home and they're concerned about

48:39.033 --> 48:41.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the coverage.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got a release from
Mitch -- you got a release
from the White House.

48:42.633 --> 48:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I saw a release from
Mitch McConnell right
before I came on.

48:44.700 --> 48:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm glad we
are all well-covered here.

48:46.666 --> 48:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And he said:
"The Senate will soon take
action on the bill that the

48:48.733 --> 48:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressional Budget Office just
confirmed will reduce the growth
in premiums under Obamacare,

48:53.400 --> 48:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reduce taxes on the middle
class, and reduce the deficit."

48:56.233 --> 48:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Premiums, taxes, deficit.

48:58.433 --> 49:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What McConnell didn't
talk about was health
care, quality of coverage.

49:02.533 --> 49:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Or out-of-pocket
expenses, which this CBO
report says could be massive.

49:07.033 --> 49:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And voters
care about these things.

49:09.266 --> 49:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They care a lot
about these things.

49:11.300 --> 49:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Stu, again,
as you -- you follow these, the
political pressures on these

49:18.000 --> 49:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members of the Senate as
they think about - - the ones
who are you for reelection.

49:20.066 --> 49:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Judy, I
was looking at some numbers,
and it's really stunning.

49:23.700 --> 49:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the one group, two
groups that are supposed to
benefit most from this health

49:26.766 --> 49:28.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care bill?

49:28.800 --> 49:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Younger voters and healthier
people, right, because they have
been subsidizing older people

49:32.133 --> 49:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and people who
aren't as healthy.

49:34.166 --> 49:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what group is most opposed
to the American Health Care
Act and most critical of Donald

49:38.133 --> 49:40.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

49:40.166 --> 49:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighteen-to-34-year-olds,
younger voters, the kind of
voters that should like this.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's a real
problem for Republicans.

49:46.133 --> 49:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will
certainly see what happens.

49:48.566 --> 49:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's so much to ask about.

49:50.533 --> 49:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, the president has been
tweeting a lot over the weekend,
continuing to today, about

49:57.233 --> 50:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reports that the
Obama administration had
information about Russian
hacking, interference

50:03.266 --> 50:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in last year's presidential
election and didn't do
a lot about it until
after the election.

50:08.800 --> 50:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's going after
former President Obama, saying
he's the one to blame, he's

50:13.166 --> 50:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the one who obstructed.

50:15.333 --> 50:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where does this
get the president?

50:17.066 --> 50:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How successful a
strategy is this?

50:19.133 --> 50:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: The president's
position on Russian hacking
and metaling in the election

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is wildly confusing, because,
previously, he had said it
was a hoax that was invented

50:29.400 --> 50:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the Democrats just to explain
their loss in the election.

50:32.233 --> 50:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I guess he's OK with the
hoax, as long as it's President
-- former President Obama's

50:36.766 --> 50:38.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fault.

50:38.866 --> 50:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And President Trump does have
a remarkable ability to make
everything President Obama's

50:43.200 --> 50:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fault, one way or another.

50:45.300 --> 50:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, the
president has -- this
has been the monkey on
the president's back

50:48.900 --> 50:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for months and
months and months.

50:50.966 --> 50:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't like to talk about
it, but it seems as if this
particular report that came out

50:54.400 --> 50:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a couple days ago in
The Washington Post,
he seized on that.

50:57.633 --> 50:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I
think you're right.

50:59.800 --> 51:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's looking for some
explanation to prove
that he was right and
Obama is wrong, it's

51:03.866 --> 51:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all Obama's fault.

51:05.966 --> 51:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I think President Obama
did -- one thing that Donald
Trump says is correct is that

51:10.266 --> 51:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama did assume that
Hillary Clinton was going to
win the election and that he

51:14.400 --> 51:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could not take on
this issue publicly.

51:17.900 --> 51:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But can you imagine what Donald
Trump would have said if, a
few weeks before election,

51:22.100 --> 51:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama got on
television and said it's
all about the Russians
taking over our elections?

51:25.766 --> 51:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump would have said, it's
rigged, the election is rigged.

51:28.100 --> 51:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He already
was saying it was rigged.

51:29.733 --> 51:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that may have
influenced how the Obama
administration reacted.

51:33.033 --> 51:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what they're saying.

51:35.066 --> 51:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact,
privately, that's what the
Obama folks are saying.

51:37.166 --> 51:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just very quickly, something
that we kind of overlooked in
all the other news last week,

51:40.700 --> 51:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the was the announcement
by the Supreme Court that
they're going to take up, Stu,

51:45.533 --> 51:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a redistricting case
that affects the census,
that is going to have
a big effect on how

51:50.533 --> 51:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our politics potentially...

51:52.600 --> 51:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: This is
huge, or, as some people, say,
"yuge," because this goes to

51:58.133 --> 52:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the very heart of how
districts are drawn,
who draws the districts.

52:00.966 --> 52:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that goes to the very
heart of who gets elected and
which party benefits from how

52:05.300 --> 52:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the districts are drawn.

52:06.766 --> 52:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a thing to
absolutely keep an eye on.

52:10.033 --> 52:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court has been very reticent
to get involved on the issues
of is this a political question

52:14.733 --> 52:16.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

52:16.433 --> 52:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But by taking the case,
I guess they're going
to address it at least.

52:18.800 --> 52:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
backdrop is that the way
redistricting gerrymandering
has been happening,

52:25.466 --> 52:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, quickly, it has benefited
the Republicans, and this
is a chance to look at that.

52:28.366 --> 52:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and
redistricting that has made
seats safe is influencing things

52:35.833 --> 52:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this very health
care debate, because
members of Congress are
more worried, particularly

52:38.533 --> 52:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican members of Congress
are more worried about primaries
from the right than they are

52:42.366 --> 52:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about a general election fight.

52:43.733 --> 52:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
that one's in the fall.

52:45.633 --> 52:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So is the big
travel ban argument.

52:47.866 --> 52:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to have a
lot to look forward to.

52:50.033 --> 52:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
