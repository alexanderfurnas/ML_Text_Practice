00:11.778 --> 00:13.814
FOR SUNDAY, DECEMBER 14:

00:13.814 --> 00:15.148
LATE NIGHT DEAL, THE SENATE

00:15.148 --> 00:16.817
PASSES THE $1.1 TRILLION

00:16.817 --> 00:18.619
SPENDING BILL THAT KEEPS THE

00:18.619 --> 00:20.320
GOVERNMENT RUNNING.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.722
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.557
TWO YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY AT

00:23.557 --> 00:25.292
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY, WE LOOK

00:25.292 --> 00:27.027
AT CONNECTICUT'S GUN LAWS WHICH

00:27.027 --> 00:28.228
ARE NOW SOME OF THE MOST

00:28.228 --> 00:29.830
RESTRICTIVE IN THE NATION.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.098
>> I CAN'T LET IT BE A SENSELESS

00:31.098 --> 00:32.399
TRAGEDY BECAUSE IT WAS A

00:32.399 --> 00:34.001
PREVENTABLE TRAGEDY.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.135
>> YOU CAN CHANGE A MAGAZINE IN

00:35.135 --> 00:36.470
LITERALLY ONE SECOND.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.704
>> WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC DROP IN

00:37.704 --> 00:39.473
MURDERS IN OUR STATE.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.774
>> THE LAW'S NOT GOING TO CATCH

00:40.774 --> 00:43.043
POSSIBLE MASS MURDERERS?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.444
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

00:44.444 --> 00:45.612
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:45.612 --> 00:47.281
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.949
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:48.949 --> 00:50.450
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:50.450 --> 00:52.419
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.854
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING

00:53.854 --> 00:55.155
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:55.155 --> 00:56.523
LATE LAST NIGHT THE SENATE

00:56.523 --> 00:58.058
PASSED A SWEEPING $1.1 TRILLION

00:58.058 --> 00:59.293
SPENDING BILL, HEADING OFF A

00:59.293 --> 01:00.627
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FOR AT LEAST

01:00.627 --> 01:01.995
THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.397
THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO

01:03.397 --> 01:04.765
SIGN IT.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.300
DESPITE IT'S PASSAGE, THE BUDGET

01:06.300 --> 01:08.068
PLAN HAS DRAWN CRITICISM FROM

01:08.068 --> 01:09.569
BOTH DEMOCRATS AND TEA PARTY

01:09.569 --> 01:11.405
REPUBLICANS.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.706
BESIDES FUNDING THE MILITARY AND

01:12.706 --> 01:13.807
FIGHTING EBOLA, THE BILL ALSO

01:13.807 --> 01:15.075
RELAXES SCHOOL NUTRITION

01:15.075 --> 01:15.943
STANDARDS, CLEARS THE WAY FOR

01:15.943 --> 01:17.344
MUCH LARGER CAMPAIGN

01:17.344 --> 01:18.912
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WEALTHY

01:18.912 --> 01:20.681
INDIVIDUAL DONORS, AND INCLUDES

01:20.681 --> 01:22.182
A CONTROVERSIAL ROLLBACK ON BANK

01:22.182 --> 01:24.151
REGULATIONS PUT IN PLACE AFTER

01:24.151 --> 01:26.186
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.388
FOR SOME MORE INSIGHT WE ARE

01:28.388 --> 01:30.590
JOINED FROM WASHINGTON D.C. BY

01:30.590 --> 01:31.992
NIELS LESNIEWSKI OF ROLL CALL.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.827
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.429
>> THANK YOU.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.198
>> SO LAST NIGHT WE WERE HEADED

01:38.198 --> 01:39.266
HOME THINKING THAT THIS WAS

01:39.266 --> 01:40.534
GOING TO DRAG OUT FOR ANOTHER

01:40.534 --> 01:41.401
FEW DAYS.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.769
WHAT HAPPENED, HOW DID THIS GET

01:42.769 --> 01:43.804
THROUGH?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.506
>> WELL, WHAT WE HAD IN THE

01:46.506 --> 01:47.774
SENATE ON THE FLOOR OF THE

01:47.774 --> 01:50.410
SENATE WAS WHAT WE MIGHT CALL

01:50.410 --> 01:51.611
SATURDAY NIGHT MAGIC.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.814
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

01:53.814 --> 01:56.016
OFTEN TAKES PLACE ON THURSDAYS

01:56.016 --> 01:58.285
BUT THIS TIME IT HAD TO WAIT

01:58.285 --> 02:00.587
UNTIL SATURDAY AS LAWMAKERS

02:00.587 --> 02:02.155
REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO MOVE

02:02.155 --> 02:03.523
AHEAD ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO

02:03.523 --> 02:05.592
PASSING THE JUST OVER TRILLION

02:05.592 --> 02:08.228
DOLLAR SPENDING PACKAGE, AND

02:08.228 --> 02:09.963
INSTEAD OF HAVING PROCEDURAL

02:09.963 --> 02:11.598
VOTES THAT EXTENDED UNTIL 1:00

02:11.598 --> 02:14.001
IN THE MORNING AND THEN COMING

02:14.001 --> 02:16.336
BACK MONDAY AT ABOUT 7:30 IN THE

02:16.336 --> 02:17.904
MORNING THEY DECIDED TO GET

02:17.904 --> 02:18.739
EVERYTHING DONE.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.174
AND AS A RESULT, THEY ARE DONE

02:21.174 --> 02:24.011
WITH THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE

02:24.011 --> 02:25.779
AND THEY COME BACK ON MONDAY

02:25.779 --> 02:27.781
REALLY ON MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR A

02:27.781 --> 02:28.982
BUNCH OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

02:28.982 --> 02:29.883
NOMINATIONS.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.051
BUT THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING

02:31.051 --> 02:32.152
SITUATION IS RESOLVED.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.888
>> OKAY AS WITH ALL COMPROMISES

02:34.888 --> 02:37.124
IT USUALLY LEAVES SOME PEOPLE

02:37.124 --> 02:38.525
HAPPY.

02:38.525 --> 02:39.960
USUALLY IT SEEMS MORE PEOPLE

02:39.960 --> 02:41.928
FROM THE LEFT ARE MORE ANGRY AT

02:41.928 --> 02:43.530
PRESIDENT OBAMA OR THE

02:43.530 --> 02:44.631
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.733
>> YES, THE ANGER THIS TIME WAS

02:46.733 --> 02:48.301
SOMEWHAT PALPABLE ON THE LEFT

02:48.301 --> 02:50.837
AND EVEN ACTUALLY TOO THERE ARE

02:50.837 --> 02:53.106
SOME ON THE RIGHT WHO HAD

02:53.106 --> 02:54.474
SIMILAR VIEWS ABOUT THE BANKING

02:54.474 --> 02:56.276
PROVISIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED,

02:56.276 --> 02:58.745
SEEMINGLY IN THE LAST MINUTE, IN

02:58.745 --> 03:01.448
THE COMPROMISE AGREEMENT, IT

03:01.448 --> 03:03.350
ROLLED BACK OF A PROFESSION OF

03:03.350 --> 03:07.120
THE DODD FRANK FINANCIAL

03:07.120 --> 03:08.455
REGULATORY OVERHAUL RELATED TO

03:08.455 --> 03:10.590
THE TREATMENT OF SWAPS

03:10.590 --> 03:11.591
TRANSACTIONS.

03:11.591 --> 03:12.726
AND L BASICALLY TAKING DOWN A

03:12.726 --> 03:15.495
BIT OF A FIRE WALL THAT HAD BEEN

03:15.495 --> 03:16.696
BUILT IN BANKING ACTIVITIES.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.565
BUT THE OTHER THING TOO IS, IS

03:18.565 --> 03:20.700
THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE

03:20.700 --> 03:22.135
MORE CONSERVATIVE END OF THE

03:22.135 --> 03:23.670
SPECTRUM WERE NOT PLEASED OVER

03:23.670 --> 03:26.373
THE FACT THAT THE BILL DID NOT

03:26.373 --> 03:28.675
DO ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVELY TO

03:28.675 --> 03:31.111
ATTACK THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE

03:31.111 --> 03:32.045
ACTION ON IMMIGRATION.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.714
SO THERE WAS SORT OF ALL COMERS

03:34.714 --> 03:36.083
HAD SOMETHING NOT TO LIKE WHICH

03:36.083 --> 03:38.552
IS PROBABLY WHY THERE WERE LOTS

03:38.552 --> 03:41.154
OF VOTES AGAINST IT ON BOTH ENDS

03:41.154 --> 03:41.988
OF THE SPECTRUM.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.390
>> OKAY.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.724
IMMIGRATION STILL WILL BE

03:44.724 --> 03:46.159
DEBATED JUST AT A LATER DATE.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.727
THERE IS KIND OF A CLIFF AT THE

03:47.727 --> 03:49.629
END OF FEBRUARY WHERE THE

03:49.629 --> 03:50.764
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

03:50.764 --> 03:52.032
NEEDS MORE FUNDING, RIGHT?

03:52.032 --> 03:52.899
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.001
AND THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICAN

03:55.001 --> 03:56.970
LEADERSHIP ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

03:56.970 --> 03:58.472
CAPITAL HAVE BEEN SAYING SINCE

03:58.472 --> 04:00.173
THE BEGINNING WAS LOOK, LET'S

04:00.173 --> 04:01.708
PUNT THIS ISSUE UNTIL THE

04:01.708 --> 04:03.310
REPUBLICANS ARE IN CONTROL OF

04:03.310 --> 04:05.245
THE SENATE.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.613
WHEN THERE MIGHT BE SOME

04:06.613 --> 04:08.315
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY MAKE A

04:08.315 --> 04:10.016
SUBSTANTIVE POLICY CHANGE.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.986
YOU KNEW THAT WITH THE DEMOCRATS

04:12.986 --> 04:14.354
IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE, YOU

04:14.354 --> 04:16.289
WERE GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY

04:16.289 --> 04:17.991
GETTING ANYTHING THROUGH IT ALL

04:17.991 --> 04:20.594
IN THE MEANTIME.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.829
BUT AT LEAST COME FEBRUARY FROM

04:22.829 --> 04:24.998
THEIR POINT OF VIEW, THAT WILL

04:24.998 --> 04:26.800
BE A CHANCE TO FORCE SOMETHING

04:26.800 --> 04:28.335
MAYBE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DESK.

04:28.335 --> 04:31.404
>> ALL RIGHT, NIELS LESNIEWSKI

04:31.404 --> 04:33.874
OF ROLL CALL JOINING US FROM

04:33.874 --> 04:34.541
WASHINGTON, D.C.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.709
THANKS SO MUCH.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.611
>> THANK YOU.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.615
>> BLACK MEN AT THE HANDS OF

04:41.615 --> 04:43.316
POLICE

04:43.316 --> 04:44.651
>> Sreenivasan: TENS OF

04:44.651 --> 04:47.954
THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS

04:47.954 --> 04:49.689
MARCHED IN MAJOR CITIES ACROSS

04:49.689 --> 04:50.957
THE COUNTRY YESTERDAY,

04:50.957 --> 04:52.125
PROTESTING THE DEATHS OF UNARMED

04:52.125 --> 04:53.293
BLACK MEN AT THE HANDS OF

04:53.293 --> 04:54.394
POLICE.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.595
THE VAST MAJORITY WERE PEACEFUL,

04:55.595 --> 04:57.130
BUT THERE WERE A FEW

04:57.130 --> 04:58.331
CONFRONTATIONS WITH POLICE,

04:58.331 --> 04:59.132
INCLUDING AN ATTACK ON TWO

04:59.132 --> 04:59.866
N.Y.P.D. LIEUTENANTS FROM

04:59.866 --> 05:00.700
PROTESTERS WHO VENTURED ONTO THE

05:00.700 --> 05:01.401
BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.202
NEITHER OFFICER SUFFERED LIFE-

05:02.202 --> 05:02.903
THREATENING INJURIES.

05:02.903 --> 05:03.637
THEIR ATTACKERS WERE NOT

05:03.637 --> 05:04.237
ARRESTED.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.071
BUT IN CALIFORNIA, 45 PEOPLE

05:05.071 --> 05:05.805
WERE ARRESTED IN SAN FRANCISCO

05:05.805 --> 05:06.439
AND OAKLAND.

05:06.439 --> 05:07.274
ANOTHER 23 WERE ARRESTED IN

05:07.274 --> 05:08.041
BOSTON.

05:08.041 --> 05:08.742
THERE WERE NO ARRESTS REPORTED

05:08.742 --> 05:09.609
IN WASHINGTON D.C. WHERE AN

05:09.609 --> 05:10.577
ESTIMATED 25,000 PEOPLE MARCHED

05:10.577 --> 05:11.478
TO THE U.S. CAPITAL.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.412
TODAY MARKS EXACTLY TWO YEARS

05:12.412 --> 05:13.246
SINCE ADAM LANZA KILLED HIS

05:13.246 --> 05:14.181
MOTHER, THEN GUNNED DOWN 20

05:14.181 --> 05:15.215
YOUNG CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS AT

05:15.215 --> 05:16.049
SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

05:16.049 --> 05:17.050
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.185
LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE

05:18.185 --> 05:19.286
AMONG THE FIRST TO RESPOND TO

05:19.286 --> 05:20.220
THE SHOOTING, LOWERED THEIR

05:20.220 --> 05:21.054
STATION'S FLAG TO HALF-STAFF

05:21.054 --> 05:21.821
THIS MORNING.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.656
CITY LEADERS HAVE DECIDED NOT TO

05:22.656 --> 05:23.323
HOLD ANY PUBLIC CEREMONIES

05:23.323 --> 05:24.257
TODAY.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.225
INSTEAD, THEY'RE CALLING FOR

05:25.225 --> 05:26.893
PRIVATE REFLECTION.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.261
SINCE THE SHOOTING, THE SCHOOL

05:28.261 --> 05:35.702
HAS BEEN DEMOLISHED AND A

05:35.702 --> 05:37.103
HANDFUL OF THE VICTIM'S PARENTS

05:37.103 --> 05:38.538
ARE CONSIDERING PLANS FOR A

05:38.538 --> 05:39.739
PERMANENT MEMORIAL.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.007
MEANWHILE, THE CITY HAS TAKEN

05:41.007 --> 05:41.708
POSSESSION OF THE LANZA HOME,

05:41.708 --> 05:42.509
BUT OFFICIALS HAVE NOT DECIDED

05:42.509 --> 05:43.343
WHAT TO DO WITH IT YET.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.244
WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM CONNECTICUT

05:44.244 --> 05:45.178
IN A MOMENT.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.112
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK

05:46.112 --> 05:47.113
CHENEY DEFENDED THE C.I.A.'S

05:47.113 --> 05:48.148
POST-9/11 INTERROGATION PROGRAM,

05:48.148 --> 05:49.182
DESPITE CRITICISM IN THE WAKE OF

05:49.182 --> 05:50.250
THE SENATE REPORT RELEASED

05:50.250 --> 05:51.718
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.819
ON NBC'S "MEET THE PRESS" TODAY,

05:52.819 --> 05:53.653
CHENEY SAID THE PROGRAM

05:53.653 --> 05:56.389
CAREFULLY AVOIDED TORTURE.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.324
>> AND THE TECHNIQUES WE DID IN

05:57.324 --> 05:58.558
FACT USE, WHICH THE PRESIDENT

05:58.558 --> 06:00.026
AUTHORIZED, THAT PRODUCED

06:00.026 --> 06:02.195
RESULTS, THAT GAVE US THE

06:02.195 --> 06:04.731
INFORMATION WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE

06:04.731 --> 06:05.966
TO SAFEGUARD THE NATION AGAINST

06:05.966 --> 06:07.400
FURTHER ATTACKS, AND TO BE ABLE

06:07.400 --> 06:09.502
TO TRACK DOWN THOSE GUILTY FOR

06:09.502 --> 06:12.305
9/11, DID IN FACT WORK.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.940
>> Sreenivasan: AND, FOR THE

06:13.940 --> 06:15.475
FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, CLIMATE

06:15.475 --> 06:17.143
CHANGE NEGOTIATORS HAVE COME UP

06:17.143 --> 06:18.578
WITH A PLAN TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE

06:18.578 --> 06:19.679
GAS EMISSIONS IN EVERY SINGLE

06:19.679 --> 06:20.547
NATION.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.581
THE AGREEMENT REQUIRES ALL 196

06:21.581 --> 06:22.849
COUNTRIES TO CREATE A DETAILED

06:22.849 --> 06:23.783
PLAN WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS

06:23.783 --> 06:24.784
TO LIMIT EMISSIONS FROM BURNING

06:24.784 --> 06:25.752
COAL, GAS, AND OIL.

06:25.752 --> 06:26.987
NEGOTIATORS IN PERU HAILED THE

06:26.987 --> 06:28.021
DEAL AS A VICTORY, BUT

06:28.021 --> 06:29.289
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAY IT

06:29.289 --> 06:30.490
FALLS FAR SHORT OF STAVING OFF

06:30.490 --> 06:31.591
GLOBAL WARMING BECAUSE THERE ARE

06:31.591 --> 06:32.692
NO MEANS TO VERIFY A NATION DOES

06:32.692 --> 06:45.438
WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.574
>> Sreenivasan: THE PARENTS OF

06:47.574 --> 06:49.409
SOME OF THE VICTIMS OF THE

06:49.409 --> 06:50.777
SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK

06:50.777 --> 06:52.245
ELEMENTARY ARE EXPECTED TO

06:52.245 --> 06:54.180
ANNOUNCE TOMORROW THAT THEY ARE

06:54.180 --> 06:55.282
SUING BUSHMASTER, THE

06:55.282 --> 06:56.449
MANUFACTURER OF THE ASSAULT

06:56.449 --> 06:57.550
RIFLE USED BY ADAM LANZA TWO

06:57.550 --> 06:58.918
YEARS AGO TODAY.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.086
SOME OF THOSE PARENTS HAVE ALSO

07:00.086 --> 07:01.388
LOBBIED CONGRESS TO PASS TOUGHER

07:01.388 --> 07:02.789
FEDERAL GUN LAWS.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.324
BUT ACCORDING TO A NEW POLL

07:04.324 --> 07:05.692
RELEASED BY THE PEW RESEARCH

07:05.692 --> 07:07.160
CENTER THIS WEEK, 52% OF

07:07.160 --> 07:08.561
AMERICANS SAY IT'S MORE

07:08.561 --> 07:10.030
IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHT

07:10.030 --> 07:11.164
OF AMERICANS TO OWN GUNS.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.165
WHILE 46% SAY IT'S MORE

07:12.165 --> 07:14.000
IMPORTANT TO CONTROL GUN

07:14.000 --> 07:15.735
OWNERSHIP.

07:15.735 --> 07:18.405
YET, CONNECTICUT LEGISLATORS

07:18.405 --> 07:19.639
HAVE BUCKED NATIONAL SENTIMENT,

07:19.639 --> 07:21.207
ENACTING SOME OF THE STRICTEST

07:21.207 --> 07:22.676
GUN REGULATIONS IN THE COUNTRY.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.010
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

07:24.010 --> 07:25.312
JOHN CARLOS FRAY TRAVELED THERE

07:25.312 --> 07:26.646
TO SEE IF THE NEW RESTRICTIONS

07:26.646 --> 07:28.715
ARE HAVING ANY EFFECT.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.383
>> IT STARTED LIKE ANY OTHER

07:30.383 --> 07:33.219
NORMAL DAY.

07:33.219 --> 07:36.523
GOT THE KIDS READY FOR SCHOOL.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.693
GOT DYLAN TO TAKE HIS VITAMINS,

07:39.693 --> 07:41.861
WHICH HE FOUGHT ME ON EVERY

07:41.861 --> 07:42.896
MORNING, AND WE WENT UP THE

07:42.896 --> 07:45.198
DRIVEWAY TO THE BUS.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.633
AND THAT WAS LAST TIME I SAW HIM

07:46.633 --> 07:48.168
ALIVE.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.170
>> Reporter: NICOLE HOCKLEY'S

07:50.170 --> 07:51.971
SIX YEAR-OLD SON, DYLAN, WHOSE

07:51.971 --> 07:53.440
BRIGHT BLUE EYES AND LAUGH

07:53.440 --> 07:54.941
FILLED A ROOM, WHOSE FAVORITE

07:54.941 --> 07:56.976
FOODS WERE HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE

07:56.976 --> 07:58.611
BARS, RED DELICIOUS APPLES, AND

07:58.611 --> 08:00.046
GARLIC BREAD, WAS ONE OF 20

08:00.046 --> 08:01.314
CHILDREN AND SIX ADULTS WHO DIED

08:01.314 --> 08:02.849
IN A HAIL OF GUN FIRE AT SANDY

08:02.849 --> 08:04.517
HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TWO

08:04.517 --> 08:07.821
YEARS-AGO TODAY.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.856
DYLAN WHO WAS AUTISTIC, WAS

08:09.856 --> 08:11.558
FOUND IN THE ARMS OF HIS SCHOOL

08:11.558 --> 08:13.226
AID, ANNE MARIE MURPHY, WHO DIED

08:13.226 --> 08:16.329
TRYING TO SHIELD HIM.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.798
>> IN SOME RESPECTS, THAT MAKES

08:18.798 --> 08:23.236
SO MUCH SENSE, CAUSE SHE

08:23.236 --> 08:32.078
WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HIM.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.982
SO-- SO THEY DIED TOGETHER.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.752
THERE'S A LOT NICOLE DOESN'T

08:38.752 --> 08:40.086
REMEMBER FROM THAT HORRIBLE DAY,

08:40.086 --> 08:41.988
BUT SHE CLEARLY RECALLS THE MAN

08:41.988 --> 08:43.590
WHO GAVE HER THE NEWS NO PARENT

08:43.590 --> 08:45.725
WANTS TO HEAR, CONNECTICUT

08:45.725 --> 08:47.394
GOVERNOR DAN MALLOY.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.028
MALLOY SPOKE IN A BACK ROOM OF

08:49.028 --> 08:49.963
THE FIREHOUSE WHERE PARENTS HAD

08:49.963 --> 08:53.566
GATHERED.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.368
>> I DID SAY THE-- TO THE

08:55.368 --> 08:58.772
PARENTS.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.039
THAT IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN UNITED

09:00.039 --> 09:01.274
WITH THEIR FAMILY ALREADY, THEN

09:01.274 --> 09:02.642
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE UNITED

09:02.642 --> 09:04.878
WITH THEIR FAMILY.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.879
>> AND THE ROOM JUST ERUPTED.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.347
AND I'LL BE HONEST, AT THAT

09:07.347 --> 09:08.615
MOMENT IN TIME I-- I-- I HATED

09:08.615 --> 09:13.186
HIM.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.287
(LAUGHS)

09:14.287 --> 09:15.121
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHO HAD TOLD

09:15.121 --> 09:22.028
ME.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.296
>> Reporter: BUT SINCE THAT

09:23.296 --> 09:24.531
TERRIBLE DAY THE TWO HAVE BECOME

ALLIES IN THE FIGHT FOR NEW GUN

09:25.832 --> 09:27.033
RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS

09:27.033 --> 09:28.301
THAT WOULD KEEP WEAPONS OUT OF

09:38.011 --> 09:39.846
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP

09:39.846 --> 09:42.582
IT.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.783
I CAN'T LET IT BE A SENSELESS

09:43.783 --> 09:44.951
TRAGEDY BECAUSE IT WAS A

09:44.951 --> 09:45.885
PREVENTABLE TRAGEDY.

GRIDLOCK, IN APRIL OF 2013

09:51.591 --> 09:52.859
GOVERNOR MALLOY SIGNED INTO

09:52.859 --> 09:53.760
CONNECTICUT LAW SOME OF THE MOST

09:53.760 --> 09:54.761
RESTRICTIVE GUN POLICIES IN THE

COUNTRY.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.997

09:57.997 --> 09:59.365
SAY IT'S FAR TOO EARLY TO TELL

09:59.365 --> 10:00.733
HOW EFFECTIVE THE NEW LAW IS,

10:00.733 --> 10:03.136
GOVERNOR MALLOY POINTS TO THE

10:03.136 --> 10:05.405
FACT THAT THERE WERE 32% FEWER

10:05.405 --> 10:07.941
MURDERS IN 2013 THAN 2011.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.642
>> WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC DROP IN

10:09.642 --> 10:12.045
MURDERS IN OUR STATE.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.314
WE'VE DENIED PEOPLE THE ABILITY

10:14.314 --> 10:16.282
TO PURCHASE WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY

10:16.282 --> 10:17.784
FELL INTO A CATEGORY SUCH AS A

10:17.784 --> 10:19.052
FELONY CONVICTION OR MENTAL

10:42.942 --> 10:44.544

10:45.979 --> 10:48.181
LARGE CAPACITY MAGAZINES HOLDING

MORE THAN TEN ROUNDS WERE BANNED

10:49.182 --> 10:50.316

10:50.316 --> 10:51.551
>> THIS IS A WEAPON THAT'S BEEN

10:51.551 --> 10:53.520
BANNED IN YOUR STATE.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.121
IT'S BEEN DETERMINED TO BE AN

10:55.121 --> 10:56.055
ASSAULT WEAPON.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.323
AND OBVIOUSLY IT WAS USED IN

10:57.323 --> 10:58.625
SANDY HOOK.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.559
SO WE KNOW THAT IT KILLED QUITE

10:59.559 --> 11:01.294
A FEW PEOPLE.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.495
>> IT DIDN'T KILL 20 SCHOOL

CHILDREN IN SANDY HOOK.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.899
ADAM LANZA KILLED 20 SCHOOL

YOU FOR OWNING THE SAME TYPE OF

12:10.163 --> 12:11.497
TO DIMINISH MASS SHOOTINGS?

CONNECTICUT'S NEW GUN LAW, WHEN

12:34.020 --> 12:35.021
IT COMES TO MASS SHOOTINGS, IS

12:35.021 --> 12:35.788

ADAM LANZA USED A MAGAZINE WITH

12:36.689 --> 12:37.924

OTHER MASS SHOOTING SCENARIOS,

12:42.328 --> 12:43.296
THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION

12:43.296 --> 12:44.430
BETWEEN THE AMMUNITION CAPACITY,

12:44.430 --> 12:45.331
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION AN ASSAILANT

YOU CAN CHANGE A MAGAZINE IN

13:16.796 --> 13:18.331
LITERALLY ONE SECOND.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.211
CERTAINLY NOT IN THE CASE WHEN

13:32.211 --> 13:33.279
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SECOND

GABRIELLE GIFFORDS AND KILLED

14:17.023 --> 14:18.157
SIX OTHERS NEAR TUCSON, ARIZONA

14:18.157 --> 14:19.859
WAS SUBDUED WHILE HE WAS

14:19.859 --> 14:22.061
RELOADING HIS GUN.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.663
STATE REP. SAMPSON, HOWEVER, IS

14:23.663 --> 14:25.298
NOT PERSUADED BY THIS ARGUMENT

14:25.298 --> 14:27.033
AND POINTS OUT THAT A STUDY ON

14:27.033 --> 14:29.035
THE FEDERAL ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN

14:29.035 --> 14:30.870
THAT EXPIRED IN 2004 FOUND THAT

14:30.870 --> 14:32.905
THE BAN DID NOT LOWER THE NUMBER

14:32.905 --> 14:34.874
OF GUN DEATHS IN THE U.S.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.142
DR. DANIEL WEBSTER AGREES THAT

14:36.142 --> 14:37.577
THE BAN DID LITTLE TO STEM

14:37.577 --> 14:38.978
BROADER GUN VIOLENCE, BUT SAYS

14:38.978 --> 14:39.879
THAT THE STUDY DID NOT FOCUS ON

14:39.879 --> 14:42.882
MASS SHOOTINGS.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.384
>> IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT WHEN

14:45.384 --> 14:50.156
THE BAN EXPIRED IN 2004, THAT

14:50.156 --> 14:51.624
FOLLOWING THAT, WE EXPERIENCED A

14:51.624 --> 14:52.992
GREAT INCREASE IN MASS SHOOTINGS

14:52.992 --> 14:54.160
AND IN PARTICULAR THE NUMBER OF

14:54.160 --> 14:56.362
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SHOT IN SUCH

14:56.362 --> 14:57.563
SHOOTINGS.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.798
>> Reporter: IN SEPTEMBER THE

14:58.798 --> 14:59.766
F.B.I. RELEASED A STUDY THAT

14:59.766 --> 15:00.600
SUPPORTS WEBSTER'S ANALYSIS.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.468
THE F.B.I. FOUND THAT ACTIVE

15:02.468 --> 15:04.337
SHOOTER INCIDENTS, DEFINED AS AN

15:04.337 --> 15:06.172
INDIVIDUAL ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN

15:06.172 --> 15:07.907
KILLING OR ATTEMPTING TO KILL

15:07.907 --> 15:10.109
PEOPLE IN A CONFINED AREA, HAVE

15:10.109 --> 15:13.746
GONE UP IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.248
FROM 2000 TO 2007 THERE WERE AN

15:15.248 --> 15:16.115
AVERAGE OF 6.4 INCIDENTS

15:16.115 --> 15:17.550
ANNUALLY.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.985
FROM 2007 TO 2013 THAT AVERAGE

15:18.985 --> 15:25.358
JUMPED TO 16.4 INCIDENTS A YEAR.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.659
GUNS RIGHT'S ADVOCATES ARE NOT

15:26.659 --> 15:28.027
THE ONLY CRITICS OF THE NEW

15:28.027 --> 15:29.695
CONNECTICUT LAW.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.164
DR. SIGURD ACKERMAN IS THE

15:31.164 --> 15:32.398
DIRECTOR OF SILVER HILL

15:32.398 --> 15:33.800
HOSPITAL, A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY

15:33.800 --> 15:35.368
IN CONNECTICUT.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.836
HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT A

15:36.836 --> 15:38.204
REQUIREMENT IN THE LAW THAT SAYS

15:38.204 --> 15:39.839
MOST PATIENTS WHO ADMIT

15:39.839 --> 15:41.073
THEMSELVES FOR PSYCHIATRIC

15:41.073 --> 15:42.775
TREATMENT MUST BE REPORTED TO

15:42.775 --> 15:46.846
THE STATE.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.381
IF I COME IN BECAUSE I'M BULIMIC

15:48.381 --> 15:50.016
OR BECAUSE I MAY BE SEVERELY

15:50.016 --> 15:51.350
DEPRESSED FROM A BREAKUP, I WILL

15:51.350 --> 15:52.819
HAVE MY GUN RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.854
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.022
>> Reporter: DO YOU FIND THAT TO

15:56.022 --> 15:57.623
BE PRUDENT?

15:57.623 --> 15:58.925
>> WELL, I FIND THAT TO BE

15:58.925 --> 16:00.459
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.895
IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF

16:02.895 --> 16:04.497
DISCOURAGING MANY PEOPLE FROM

16:04.497 --> 16:06.933
SEEKING TREATMENT BECAUSE

16:06.933 --> 16:08.401
THEY'LL BE REPORTED.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.102
>> Reporter: DR. ACKERMAN SAYS

16:10.102 --> 16:11.470
THAT THE LAW WAS PASSED IN A

16:11.470 --> 16:13.139
HURRY AND HE BELIEVES THAT THE

16:13.139 --> 16:14.507
LAW FOCUSES ON TOO BROAD A

16:14.507 --> 16:15.341
GROUP, WHEN IT SHOULD BE FOCUSED

16:15.341 --> 16:16.275
ON THOSE WHO ACTUALLY POSE A

16:16.275 --> 16:17.577
THREAT.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.178
LIKE THOSE WITH A HISTORY OF

16:19.178 --> 16:20.947
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.582
>> WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE

16:22.582 --> 16:24.450
PEOPLE WHO ARE VOLUNTARILY

16:24.450 --> 16:27.753
ADMITTED TO A PSYCHIATRIC

16:27.753 --> 16:30.623
FACILITY ARE NOT THOSE PEOPLE.

16:30.623 --> 16:34.994
SO THEY'VE GOT THE WRONG GROUP.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.095
>> Reporter: THE LAW'S NOT GOING

16:36.095 --> 16:36.929
TO CATCH POSSIBLE MASS

16:36.929 --> 16:38.531
MURDERERS?

16:38.531 --> 16:39.565
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

16:39.565 --> 16:40.433
>> Reporter: DR. ACKERMAN POINTS

16:40.433 --> 16:41.234
OUT THAT ADAM LANZA WAS NOT

16:41.234 --> 16:42.201
SEEKING TREATMENT FOR MENTAL

16:42.201 --> 16:43.703
ILLNESS, AS A RECENTLY RELEASED

16:43.703 --> 16:45.104
REPORT ABOUT LANZA'S LIFE

16:45.104 --> 16:46.105
REVEALED, SO HE WOULD NOT HAVE

16:46.105 --> 16:47.707
ENDED UP IN A STATE DATABASE OF

16:47.707 --> 16:49.175
THOSE BANNED FROM OWNING A GUN.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.443
BUT GOVERNOR MALLOY SAYS THAT

16:50.443 --> 16:51.878
THE LEGISLATION HAS ALREADY

16:51.878 --> 16:53.145
WORKED.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.447
>> WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO STOP

16:54.447 --> 16:56.682
SOMEONE FROM BUYING A GUN WHO

16:56.682 --> 16:57.750
ADVOCATED OR SAID THAT THEY

16:57.750 --> 16:59.852
WANTED TO USE THAT TO SHOOT UP

16:59.852 --> 17:02.121
ANOTHER SCHOOL.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.756
>> Reporter: ITS THE CASE OF AN

17:03.756 --> 17:05.458
18-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH MENTAL

17:05.458 --> 17:06.759
HEALTH ISSUES WHO ADMITTED

17:06.759 --> 17:07.827
HERSELF TO A GROUP HOME FOR

17:07.827 --> 17:08.928
TREATMENT.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.363
SHE ATTEMPTED TO PURCHASE A GUN,

17:10.363 --> 17:11.564
BUT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TOLD

17:11.564 --> 17:12.665
NEWSHOUR THAT SHE WAS PREVENTED

17:12.665 --> 17:14.267
FROM DOING SO BECAUSE HER NAME

17:14.267 --> 17:15.968
WAS IN THE STATE DATABASE.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.603
UPON INVESTIGATION POLICE FOUND

17:17.603 --> 17:19.038
A MANIFESTO ABOUT HER PLANS TO

17:19.038 --> 17:20.106
SHOOT STUDENTS AT TWO HIGH

17:20.106 --> 17:23.009
SCHOOLS.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.443
NICOLE HOCKLEY, MOTHER OF DYLAN,

17:24.443 --> 17:25.811
BELIEVES THE STEPS CONNECTICUT

17:25.811 --> 17:28.014
TOOK HAVE MADE HER STATE SAFER

17:28.014 --> 17:29.115
BUT SHE CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE

17:29.115 --> 17:30.549
FOR OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL

17:30.549 --> 17:34.053
GOVERNMENT TO FOLLOW SUIT.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.588
IT'S TOO EASY, SHE SAYS TO

17:35.588 --> 17:36.789
SIMPLY DRIVE ACROSS STATE LINES

17:36.789 --> 17:37.690
AND BUY A GUN IN STATE WITH LESS

17:37.690 --> 17:42.194
STRICT GUN REGULATIONS.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.462
>> IT HURTS ME IN MY HEART EVERY

17:43.462 --> 17:45.164
DAY WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER MASS

17:45.164 --> 17:48.467
SHOOTING.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.370
SEEING SCENES OF HELICOPTER

17:51.370 --> 17:54.507
FOOTAGE OF CHILDREN RUNNING FROM

17:54.507 --> 17:56.309
SCHOOLS, IT'S JUST-- IT'S

17:56.309 --> 17:57.643
BECOMING FAR TO FAMILIAR A

17:57.643 --> 17:59.412
SIGHT.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.446
THAT ISN'T THE COUNTRY THAT

18:00.446 --> 18:01.814
WE'RE MEANT TO BE.

18:01.814 --> 18:07.486
WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.654
>> Sreenivasan: CONNECTICUT'S

18:08.654 --> 18:09.555
GUN LAWS ARE NOW SOME OF THE

18:09.555 --> 18:10.456
MOST RESTRICTIVE IN THE COUNTRY.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.457
WOULD YOU SUPPORT SIMILAR LAWS

18:11.457 --> 18:12.325
WHERE YOU LIVE?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.159
TAKE OUR POLL AND WEIGH IN AT

newshour.pbs.org.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.467

18:21.467 --> 18:22.668
DARLING OF WALL STREET AND THE

18:22.668 --> 18:23.703
BAIN OF LOCAL REGULATORS ACROSS

18:23.703 --> 18:24.737
THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE

18:24.737 --> 18:25.838
WORLD.

18:25.838 --> 18:29.475
UBER IS THE ON-DEMAND CAR

18:29.475 --> 18:31.410
SHARING SERVICE WHICH FACES

18:31.410 --> 18:32.511
LEGAL CHALLENGES IN PORTLAND,

18:32.511 --> 18:33.612
OREGON, WHILE IT IS BANNED FROM

18:33.612 --> 18:34.714
OPERATING IN SOME CITIES

18:34.714 --> 18:36.182
ENTIRELY.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.216
ACKNOWLEDGING THE COMPETITION,

18:37.216 --> 18:37.883
NEW YORK, CHICAGO, AND

18:37.883 --> 18:40.286
WASHINGTON D.C. ARE TRYING TO

18:40.286 --> 18:42.021
FIGHT BACK WITH THEIR OWN CAB

18:42.021 --> 18:43.589
APPS.

18:43.589 --> 18:44.824
AT THE SAME TIME, UBER IS VALUED

18:44.824 --> 18:45.691
AT $41.2 BILLION-- EASILY

18:45.691 --> 18:47.159
OUTPACING EVERY OTHER PRIVATE

18:47.159 --> 18:48.060
STARTUP.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.095
ITS WORTH MORE THAN PUBLICLY

18:49.095 --> 18:50.696
TRADED COMPANIES LIKE DELTA

18:50.696 --> 18:51.630
AIRLINES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AND

18:51.630 --> 18:53.065
KRAFT FOODS.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.600
JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS THE

18:54.600 --> 18:56.402
UBER BOOM IS LIZ GANNES, A

18:56.402 --> 18:59.105
SENIOR EDITOR AT RE/CODE FROM

18:59.105 --> 19:01.073
SAN FRANCISCO.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.575
THANKS FOSTER JOINING US.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.243
>> SURE.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.878
>> THE RECENT PROBLEM AND

19:05.878 --> 19:07.747
PERHAPS WORST PROBLEM UBER HAS

19:07.747 --> 19:10.883
FACED IS A SITUATION IN INDIA,

19:10.883 --> 19:14.453
WHERE A PASSENGER SAID THE

19:14.453 --> 19:16.989
DRIVER TURNED OFF THE METER AND

19:16.989 --> 19:18.591
TOOK HER SOMEPLACE ELSE AND

19:18.591 --> 19:19.291
RAPED HER.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.893
REALLY THE CORE OF IT IS A LEVEL

19:20.893 --> 19:22.261
OF TRUST AND SECURITY THAT A

19:22.261 --> 19:24.063
USER HAS TO HAVE THAT THEY'RE

19:24.063 --> 19:25.631
SAFE WHEN THEY'RE IN THE CAR.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.034
HOW DOES THIS COMPANY DEAL WITH

19:28.034 --> 19:28.901
THIS CHALLENGE?

19:28.901 --> 19:32.471
>> UBER IN ADDITION TO STEP UP

19:32.471 --> 19:33.906
ITS BACKGROUND CHECKS.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.274
IN INDIA DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE

19:35.274 --> 19:37.009
LOCAL STATEMENTS WERE THAT GREAT

19:37.009 --> 19:38.644
TO AUTHORIZE THIS SITUATION FOR

19:38.644 --> 19:39.945
THE DRIVER.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.614
AS YOU SAY THIS IS AN APP ON

19:41.614 --> 19:43.682
YOUR PHONE BUT IT'S AN APP THAT

19:43.682 --> 19:45.885
CONNECTS YOU AS A PASSENGER,

19:45.885 --> 19:47.219
PUTTING YOURSELF IN A CAR IN THE

19:47.219 --> 19:47.853
REAL WORLD.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.588
SO YOU REALLY NEED TO TRUST THAT

19:49.588 --> 19:50.723
THAT IS A SITUATION THAT YOU

19:50.723 --> 19:52.258
WILL BE SAFE IN.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.860
COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL TAXIS

19:54.860 --> 19:56.462
THOUGH, THERE IS A LEVEL ABOVE

19:56.462 --> 19:57.596
AND BEYOND ONCE YOU'RE IN THE

19:57.596 --> 19:59.031
CAR AND ONCE SOMEONE IS IN THE

19:59.031 --> 20:00.032
SYSTEM.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.001
I THINK THE ISSUE LEADING UP TO

20:02.001 --> 20:04.236
THIS IS THE BACKGROUND CHECKS.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.739
ONCE YOU'RE DRIVER OR PASSENGER

20:06.739 --> 20:08.207
ON UBER AT THE END OF EVERY RIDE

20:08.207 --> 20:09.875
YOU RATE THE OTHER ONE ON A

20:09.875 --> 20:12.545
SCALE OF 1 TO 5 STARS.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.314
IF YOU DON'T GET FOUR OR FIVE

20:15.314 --> 20:16.715
STARS YOU'RE NOT WELCOME IN THE

20:16.715 --> 20:17.516
SYSTEM ANYMORE.

20:17.516 --> 20:20.886
THAT IS A TRADITIONAL TAXIS,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.221
DOESN'T GET THE BAD GUYS OUT

20:22.221 --> 20:22.988
FROM THE BEGINNING.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.990
>> WHILE WE'VE SAID IT IS BANNED

20:24.990 --> 20:27.393
IN SOME CITIES IT IS WORKING IN

20:27.393 --> 20:31.797
250 CITIES AND THE COMPANY'S

20:31.797 --> 20:34.700
MODUS OPERANDI ASKS FOR

20:34.700 --> 20:35.901
PERMISSION, THAT'S WHY THEY GO

20:35.901 --> 20:37.169
INTO THE MARKET.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.938
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE LEGAL

20:38.938 --> 20:40.139
TUSSLES.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.807
>> WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

20:41.807 --> 20:43.275
LIKE UBER COME OUT LIKE THIS.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.111
THE COMPANY IS FIVE YEARS OLD

20:45.111 --> 20:46.579
AND THEY'RE 250 CITIES AND

20:46.579 --> 20:47.947
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY WOULD

20:47.947 --> 20:50.316
BE THAT BIG IF THEY'D GONE

20:50.316 --> 20:51.517
AROUND AND ASKED REGULATORS AND

20:51.517 --> 20:53.486
INCUMBENTS IF IT'S OKAY IF THEY

20:53.486 --> 21:02.528
JOINED AS WELL.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.864
>> THE FACT THAT THIS COMPANY IS

21:04.864 --> 21:06.432
WORTH MORE THAN AN ENTIRE

21:06.432 --> 21:07.700
AIRLINE, WHAT DO INVESTORS SEE

21:07.700 --> 21:09.201
IN IT BEYOND JUST THE CAR

21:09.201 --> 21:10.469
SHARING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

21:10.469 --> 21:11.737
TODAY?

21:11.737 --> 21:13.139
>> INVESTORS ARE HOPEFUL THAT

21:13.139 --> 21:15.174
UBER BECAUSE IT IS SO GOOD ABOUT

21:15.174 --> 21:16.242
CONNECTING SOMEONE WHO HAS A

21:16.242 --> 21:21.614
NEED TO GET AROUND TOWN AND

21:21.614 --> 21:24.483
SOMEBODY WHO IS ALREADY NEARBY,

21:24.483 --> 21:33.025
WOULD BE LOGISTICS FOR LOT OF

21:33.025 --> 21:34.493
EXPERIMENTS AROUND THAT BUT THAT

21:34.493 --> 21:37.229
IDEA OF KIND OF INSTANT

21:37.229 --> 21:39.031
GRATIFICATION THAT IS POWERED BY

21:39.031 --> 21:42.434
SMART FUNDS, BOTH BY CONSUMERS

21:42.434 --> 21:44.637
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY DRIVERS IS

21:44.637 --> 21:47.006
THIS BIG TECHNOLOGICAL

21:47.006 --> 21:48.807
OPPORTUNITY.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.975
ESPECIALLY INTERNET COMPANIES,

21:49.975 --> 21:52.044
UBER HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

21:52.044 --> 21:53.345
REVENUE.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.980
THEY'RE PRIVATE SO THEY DON'T

21:54.980 --> 21:56.415
DISCLOSE IT.

21:56.415 --> 21:57.816
BUT IT'S UP IN THE BILLIONS FOR

22:00.419 --> 22:02.688
STREET IF IT EVER DOES GO PUBLIC

22:02.688 --> 22:04.290

22:05.758 --> 22:07.193
FIGURE OUT THE BUSINESS MODEL

22:07.193 --> 22:08.194

22:38.924 --> 22:40.392
TENSION, REEMERGE BETWEEN RICH

22:40.392 --> 22:41.060
AND POOR COUNTRIES.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.261
WHAT WAS THE ARGUMENT ABOUT?

22:42.261 --> 22:44.863

THEY WERE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO

22:49.201 --> 22:51.403

22:53.372 --> 22:54.707
DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR

22:54.707 --> 22:55.474
CLIMATE CHANGE.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.810

CLIMATE EVENTS IN THE FUTURE?

23:15.160 --> 23:17.363
THAT EXPLODED OUT IN THE OPEN.

23:17.363 --> 23:20.766
WE HAD VENEZUELA AND CHINA

23:20.766 --> 23:22.401

23:32.378 --> 23:34.380
