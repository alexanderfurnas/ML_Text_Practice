months of false starts political
maneuvering and

00:28.595 --> 00:28.161
heated debate

00:30.464 --> 00:34.167
Congress voted overwhelmingly
today to give itself a voice

its lasting economic impact when
they're at their boiling point
when it comes to

00:51.418 --> 00:55.122
them lashing out was the worst
that can happen is already

00:57.791 --> 01:01.795

some other stories we're
covering on tonight

01:22.783 --> 01:24.384
the Iranian supporters

01:24.384 --> 01:27.254
won't try to exploit the law
we strongly urge duties

01:29.089 --> 01:32.225
and those who back
whom we suggest

01:34.561 --> 01:39.866
use all of their influence not
to miss this major opportunity

01:39.866 --> 01:43.270
to address the needs of the
Yemeni people at find a peaceful
way forward

01:45.906 --> 01:50.210
in Yemen the humanitarian
situation in Yemen has worsened
sharply since the

01:50.210 --> 01:51.244
saudi bombing campaign
began in March

01:53.914 --> 01:56.249
the UN's humanitarian

to Syrian

02:13.867 --> 02:15.969
President Bashar al Assad

02:15.969 --> 02:18.472
with logistical support and
funding the US opposes helping
some other groups

02:20.173 --> 02:21.375
because they are
Islamists router

02:22.743 --> 02:26.580
als meanwhile the Pentagon
confirms that the US military
advisers

02:26.580 --> 02:28.281
have begun training Syrians to
battle Islamic state forces

02:30.450 --> 02:33.854

02:36.656 --> 02:38.525
acknowledged

02:38.525 --> 02:40.994
it will still be some time
before the fighter see combat

02:40.994 --> 02:43.330
these at trainees are recruited

02:45.532 --> 02:48.335
their vetted and only then
are they put into trainee

02:50.470 --> 02:53.807
so they've been in the
program for quite a while

02:53.807 --> 02:58.045
i'd in the Pro than the training
take some time and then they
would be

02:58.045 --> 03:01.348
in inserted into operations
other training sites are in
Saudi Arabia Qatar

03:02.716 --> 03:03.283
and Turkey

03:05.452 --> 03:08.922
more than thirty seven hundred
Syrians have volunteered

03:08.922 --> 03:12.993
its election night in Britain
and exit polls say there's a
surprise outcome

03:12.993 --> 03:15.328
the ruling conservatives have
far exceeded expectations easily
winning the

03:16.696 --> 03:16.329
most seats

03:18.565 --> 03:21.802
they'll still need to form a
coalition with the smaller party

03:21.802 --> 03:24.404
party leaders and millions of
other voters cast ballots today
after a

03:24.404 --> 03:25.338
campaign that focused
on economic troubles

03:27.574 --> 03:30.811
the National Health Service
and the issue up migrants

03:30.811 --> 03:33.313
iran has released a cargo ship
it sees last week in the persian
gulf

03:35.382 --> 03:38.852
the Maersk tigress will
now continue onto the

03:38.852 --> 03:43.023
United Arab Emirates Iran have
said the company that chartered
the ship

03:43.023 --> 03:45.926
owed money to an Iranian firm
it's unclear whether any money
was paid to

03:45.926 --> 03:46.359
win the vessels release

03:49.096 --> 03:52.866
back in this country people
across tornado alley kept a
weather eye out for

03:52.866 --> 03:54.468
a new storms today

03:54.468 --> 03:57.504
more than fifty twister
struck yesterday in oklahoma

03:57.504 --> 03:59.406
Kansas Nebraska and Texas
most plowed up farmland

04:01.708 --> 04:04.344
but in the oklahoma City area
two tornadoes blasted businesses

04:06.980 --> 04:09.649
and tore roofs off homes no one
was killed but about a dozen
people were

04:09.649 --> 04:09.349
hurt

04:11.218 --> 04:14.621
at a trailer park we're
watching it form

04:14.621 --> 04:17.624
above us and I had no clue
anything was going on over here

04:17.624 --> 04:19.359
I mean no clue at all but
I needed to come home and

04:21.495 --> 04:27.033
check what was going on
in there's nothing worked

04:27.033 --> 04:30.370
the storm system also dumped as
much as eight inches of rain
around oklahoma

04:31.638 --> 04:33.039
City

04:33.039 --> 04:35.842
triggering flash floods one
woman drowned when her
underground storm

04:35.842 --> 04:36.376
shelter flooded

04:39.079 --> 04:42.582
Wall Street had a relatively
quiet day the Dow Jones
Industrial Average gained

04:42.582 --> 04:44.417
more than 80 points to close
above seventeen thousand

04:46.720 --> 04:52.058
900 the Nasdaq rose 26 points
and the S&P 500 added nearly

04:52.058 --> 04:55.328
eight still to come on the news
hour what a court ruling could
mean for the

04:55.328 --> 04:55.462
future of government
surveillance

04:57.864 --> 05:00.400
another casualty of Nepal's
earthquake a priceless cultural
heritage

05:03.103 --> 05:05.438
two senators way and on the Iran
nuclear negotiations are what
role congress

05:06.807 --> 05:06.406
should play

05:09.042 --> 05:13.113
can Baltimore businesses bounce
back from the economic toll of
the riots

05:13.113 --> 05:15.448
how these high school students
are taking campus safety into
their own

05:16.716 --> 05:17.617
hands

05:17.617 --> 05:23.423
and a new book on the price
of past missteps in Iraq

05:30.997 --> 05:33.433
the debate between privacy and
security return to center stage
today

05:36.102 --> 05:40.073
after a federal appeals court
ruled the National Security
Agency program

05:40.073 --> 05:44.477
that allow book collection that
millions have US phone records
went too far

05:44.477 --> 05:46.780
but where is the line and as a
deadline approaches for review
renewing the

05:48.081 --> 05:48.448
underlying Patriot Act

05:50.483 --> 05:52.786
what happens now joining me to
discuss the value of such
government

05:54.287 --> 05:56.122
surveillance are Kate Martin
director of the center for
national security studies

05:58.325 --> 06:01.494
a civil liberties advocacy group
and Stewart baker a former
general counsel

06:01.494 --> 06:02.829
at the National Security Agency

06:03.797 --> 06:07.167
and former assistant secretary
of homeland security welcome

06:07.167 --> 06:09.869
to you both Kate Martin was this
the drops shoe that privacy
advocates were

06:11.071 --> 06:11.137
waiting on

06:11.137 --> 06:14.040
yes this is that first time

06:16.276 --> 06:18.878
that a federal appeals court
has look at what was there

06:19.512 --> 06:22.515
secret interpretation by their
government

06:22.515 --> 06:25.485
that allowed it to
collect and massive

06:27.320 --> 06:30.757
amount a records
on Americans under

06:30.757 --> 06:32.926
secret interpretation of the
law and the court said that

06:34.594 --> 06:36.997
that secret interpretation
that the law was not

06:38.265 --> 06:40.567
in fact authorized by the
congress and so how the program
to be a violation of

06:41.768 --> 06:41.468
the law

06:43.970 --> 06:47.974
so what does this do to stop the
program in its tracks no
actually the

06:47.974 --> 06:49.943
its it's remarkably
without consequence say

06:51.211 --> 06:53.213
it at the end of the
day says congress

06:55.282 --> 06:57.617
in the view with this court
didn't authorize exactly what
the program is

07:00.086 --> 07:01.554
and unless Congress says that
its authorized it's not going to
continue

07:03.923 --> 07:06.159
and then they send it back to
the judge leading the judge in
the district court

07:06.293 --> 07:06.559
determine whether to enjoin a

07:08.995 --> 07:11.097
to but really that's just a just
underlines what we already know
which is

07:12.132 --> 07:12.599
that Congress has to act

07:14.734 --> 07:17.203
in the next three weeks because
if it doesn't the program goes
away

07:18.038 --> 07:19.973
automatically

07:19.973 --> 07:21.675
if it does it's going to have
to say yes we're approving this

07:23.943 --> 07:26.513
program doesn't matter whether
the court decided today that
this was illegal

07:28.615 --> 07:30.717
or unconstitutional as it
neither did not decide that it
was unconstitutional

07:31.451 --> 07:33.186
they said it was not approved by
congress

07:35.155 --> 07:36.623
I was a close call in my view
whether it was approved by
congress

07:38.525 --> 07:39.759
to I think they're wrong but
they said was not approved by
congress congress

07:41.127 --> 07:42.095
has a chance and
really obligation

07:42.896 --> 07:44.597
rule on whether this case
this my program will continue

07:46.700 --> 07:48.935
are by the end of the month
I and a so they will

07:50.570 --> 07:51.805
they will they will have to say
something and that will put in
and

07:52.505 --> 07:52.539
really to the
discussion in this case

07:55.175 --> 07:56.910
kate mara so they didn't rule on
the constitutionality together
the matter

07:56.910 --> 07:56.643
I'm

07:59.279 --> 08:01.548
am jurisprudence you don't get
to that question if you decide
the statute but

08:03.616 --> 08:06.286
opinion which is 90
some pages long made

08:06.286 --> 08:08.621
out that concerns about on

08:10.357 --> 08:13.059
how the program threatens
Americans privacy

08:14.227 --> 08:18.164
and the concerns about how these
new technological tools that are
available

08:18.164 --> 08:18.898
to the government

08:20.266 --> 08:22.736
my really require

08:24.137 --> 08:28.241
re understanding up what's
constitutional and not
considered as

08:28.241 --> 08:29.676
rusty argument in those 94 pages
about whether this was tying the
hands of the

08:31.211 --> 08:31.644
intelligence community

08:33.780 --> 08:37.016
no it did not am but that you
know the intelligence community
doesn't make that

08:37.917 --> 08:38.985
argument anymore some

08:39.486 --> 08:41.821
adn politicians
make that argument

08:43.556 --> 08:45.325
Stewart might make that argument
I'm not sure politician your

08:45.825 --> 08:47.660
know I know that was
including you placed but the

08:49.796 --> 08:54.701
and Director of National
Intelligence and the president

08:54.701 --> 08:58.671
after extensive reviews by
outsiders and insiders which
concluded that

08:59.906 --> 09:03.777
I'm the program hand resulted in
stopping any terror attacks

09:03.777 --> 09:06.312
decided that there was
no intelligence value

09:08.681 --> 09:11.785
that they needed to continue the
program the essence of the
program being

09:12.719 --> 09:16.256
that the NSA gets all up
the telephone records

09:18.358 --> 09:20.994
have all come from calls made or
receipt and the white house has
been steadily

09:21.594 --> 09:24.330
backing away from
the need for that

09:24.330 --> 09:25.665
so you say both say that by the
end of this month when the
Patriot Act expire

09:27.233 --> 09:28.902
something has to happen

09:28.902 --> 09:31.905
what has to happen for
congress what McKenna action

09:31.905 --> 09:33.706
can congress take to change
that con congress can

09:35.742 --> 09:38.645
reauthorize it I in which case
the court's opinion will be

09:40.580 --> 09:43.783
overtaken by events at they can
modify the program in which case

09:45.418 --> 09:48.121
the statute will be better
tailored to what the program is
or what new program

09:48.121 --> 09:47.754
is adopted

09:49.289 --> 09:49.722
or they can let dianne

09:52.325 --> 09:56.496
and take the risk that to about
this program in a lot of other
things that

09:56.496 --> 09:59.866
are done with this is already
will not be available at 4
attacked by terrorists

09:59.866 --> 10:03.236
but the weapon what the
problem that happens well i i

10:03.236 --> 10:04.671
there are a whole lot
authorities a lot of programs
that depend

10:06.239 --> 10:09.809
on the ability to ask on

10:09.809 --> 10:13.413
service provider store:
data about their customers

10:13.413 --> 10:16.883
targeted requests as well as

10:16.883 --> 10:18.751
I'd are broader requests at
all of them will go away

10:21.454 --> 10:24.991
the section is not reauthorized
well the most likely outcome I
think in congress

10:24.991 --> 10:26.359
or

10:26.359 --> 10:28.761
the what I hope to be the likely
outcome is that congress adopt a
package of

10:30.964 --> 10:31.764
reforms which has been
considering for the past year

10:33.433 --> 10:37.303
I'm known as USA freedom act the

10:37.303 --> 10:39.772
an it has the support at the
administration and basically
those

10:41.007 --> 10:40.773
reforms

10:43.343 --> 10:47.013
would not reinstitute the
program that the court held the
illegal today

10:47.013 --> 10:50.850
they provide a different way
for the government to get

10:50.850 --> 10:52.785
on some other information
and they all fell

10:55.088 --> 10:58.892
they also make reforms other
sections have the Patriot Act

10:58.892 --> 11:00.793
that statute that weren't
addressed by court

11:02.662 --> 11:07.000
on there is
widespread bipartisan

11:07.000 --> 11:08.801
support for those reforms
in both houses of Congress

11:11.271 --> 11:14.941
I the House Judiciary Committee
passed it overwhelmingly last
week

11:14.941 --> 11:16.809
and the house is expected
to adopt them next week

11:18.811 --> 11:24.083
there has been I think
I can have peculiar

11:24.083 --> 11:28.321
afterward to say oh no we should
continue the program as it is

11:28.321 --> 11:30.857
when the intelligence community
itself isn't asking for that and
says

11:32.759 --> 11:36.629
these reforms would
be better soul

11:36.629 --> 11:38.831
I I think Kate was right when
she said only some other data
will be available

11:40.066 --> 11:41.000
that

11:41.000 --> 11:42.835
the data will disappear
because records will be kept

11:44.904 --> 11:48.441
and when we need to try
to find people quickly II

11:48.441 --> 11:50.843
and to find out who they're
conspiring with the if there is
a terrorist

11:50.843 --> 11:53.012
conspiracy in the
united states cities

11:53.012 --> 11:54.847
sponsored from abroad we
won't be able to do that now

11:57.483 --> 11:59.319
unelectable collection however
is an alternate to doing it the
way they've

11:59.319 --> 11:58.851
been doing it

12:00.887 --> 12:03.523
that the court today
said it was not legal

12:03.523 --> 12:06.159
what the court said was simply
the statute was not written to
authorize

12:06.159 --> 12:05.858
that

12:08.595 --> 12:11.531
right so little money easy for
congress to say we're going to
authorize it with

12:11.531 --> 12:14.100
certain kinds of constraints

12:14.100 --> 12:17.070
for protection any number
they could take all over the

12:17.070 --> 12:18.905
a constraints that are already
part of the court orders

12:21.140 --> 12:23.109
okay testers bipartisan interest
in this in this bill this other

12:25.144 --> 12:27.113
then there's bipartisan doubts
about the right program
especially in the senate

12:27.880 --> 12:31.417
about about about USA
freedom by and to

12:31.417 --> 12:33.886
so the area's there is genuine
debate immersed Senate
particular

12:36.189 --> 12:40.660
in the house I the far left in
the far right have agreed to

12:40.660 --> 12:44.330
just a light disliked this
program and they have the
majority at this point so

12:44.330 --> 12:45.798
I think the house will pass the
USA freedom bill I do not think
that the

12:47.400 --> 12:47.867
senate will do that

12:50.136 --> 12:52.939
well well we're almost at a time
leave a very quick common I just
wanna say and

12:53.506 --> 12:55.441
the rule of law questions

12:55.441 --> 12:56.943
this interpretation with secret
interpretation adopted by the
Bush

12:58.511 --> 12:58.878
administration and the law

13:01.147 --> 13:05.451
and then the Obama and then the
Obama administration when pushed

13:05.451 --> 13:09.722
with fused to make that
interpretation public okay I
admit that I i

13:09.722 --> 13:09.989
okay we're gonna have to leave

ceremony

13:35.548 --> 13:36.949
marking the end of a traditional
Hindu mourning period held after
the massive

13:38.317 --> 13:37.884
earthquake

13:40.420 --> 13:43.489

than seventy eight hundred

engineers are continuing to
inspect

13:47.994 --> 13:51.698
thousands of damaged
houses around katmandu

13:51.698 --> 13:55.134
the earthquake also brought
considerable destruction and
damage to religious

13:55.134 --> 13:58.604
cultural & Heritage Sites
throughout the region

13:58.604 --> 14:01.007
jeffrey Brown report on that
part of his ongoing work on
culture at risk

14:03.142 --> 14:07.980
the cremation up bodies
continue this week in Katmandu

14:10.249 --> 14:11.951
as officials warned the death
toll from the 7.8 magnitude

14:13.820 --> 14:17.690
earthquake could hit
10,000 meanwhile

14:17.690 --> 14:19.992
aid workers have struggled to
reach remote areas hampered by
customs delays

14:22.729 --> 14:25.298
closed roads and difficult to
rain and villagers have grown
frustrated by the

14:25.298 --> 14:25.031
pace

14:27.266 --> 14:28.968
an amount to relieve getting
to them in about a minute ago

14:31.604 --> 14:34.340
it is so little what can one do
with the Los summit 15 to 20
people in their

14:34.340 --> 14:36.342
faint

14:36.342 --> 14:39.011
how long will it last it won't
last the humanitarian crisis

14:41.247 --> 14:42.982
colossal lives meat cooked
food shelter and medicine

14:45.618 --> 14:46.986
has been devastating in this
mountainous country that is one
of the world's

14:48.254 --> 14:49.021
poorest

14:49.021 --> 14:51.023
at the same time another
kind of crisis has

14:53.626 --> 14:56.429
also unfolded this region once
stood at the intersection of
trade routes

14:56.429 --> 14:56.062
connecting

14:58.231 --> 15:00.032
India and China and became
home to a rich heritage if

15:02.135 --> 15:04.704
are in architecture dating
back many centuries

15:04.704 --> 15:08.674
today many of those sites sedges

15:08.674 --> 15:13.312
bach to poor square and
part-time Durbar Square both in
the Kathmandu Valley

15:13.312 --> 15:15.047
are badly damaged there are
many of the temples which

15:16.849 --> 15:20.353
call up stand or
so many of the and

15:20.353 --> 15:22.054
our historical houses in which
the families where reliving

15:24.657 --> 15:27.727
appropriate only but that would
be our streets maybe even cannot
go with the

15:27.727 --> 15:28.027
moment though this is very

15:30.730 --> 15:34.333
difficult to assess their
Christian man hard is the
director of the United

15:34.333 --> 15:34.834
Nations

15:34.834 --> 15:37.036
officer cultural
heritage in cash

15:37.036 --> 15:39.038
and do and in part
under a square we also

15:41.307 --> 15:43.075
have to I i must say fifty
percent of the tempers have

15:45.645 --> 15:47.380
have gone there just Robin all
but fortunately the royal
palaces to

15:47.380 --> 15:47.113
standing

15:49.115 --> 15:52.018
except want our bitches
which is the meaning

15:52.018 --> 15:54.086
and which we have two
consolidate very

15:56.289 --> 15:59.759
quickly that he doesn't that
it doesn't for before dawn

15:59.759 --> 16:03.496
in that city soldiers and
volunteers worked to clear
bricks and debris from a

16:03.496 --> 16:04.897
Hindu temple

16:04.897 --> 16:07.066
we love our temple
the mall so look

16:08.968 --> 16:13.272
at now what to
give and I want to

16:13.272 --> 16:16.742
heads Campbell they carefully
and are the temple

16:16.742 --> 16:19.111
room since the earthquake man
hearts team has been working to
assess the

16:21.347 --> 16:24.584
damage to the country's many
temples in historic sites

16:24.584 --> 16:27.086
and there has been some good
news long beanie temple for
example

16:29.355 --> 16:32.258
said to be the birthplace of
the Buddha was left unharmed

16:32.258 --> 16:36.395
nepal is home to four
designated World Heritage Sites

16:36.395 --> 16:39.131
to natural into cultural one
site alone the Kathmandu Valley

16:41.367 --> 16:43.135
contains 7 world-renowned groups
have monuments and buildings

16:45.238 --> 16:47.807
and tourism is vital to
this poor countries economy

16:47.807 --> 16:50.109
it the largest concentration

16:52.211 --> 16:55.047
World Heritage Sites you
know anywhere in the world

16:55.047 --> 16:58.618
and absolutely unique
in their style

16:58.618 --> 17:01.153
and in their mixture have Hindu
and Buddhist and secular
traditions

17:03.456 --> 17:07.426
gabbard I'm in is curator up
south and southeast Asian art

17:07.426 --> 17:10.029
at the Smithsonian's freer and
Sackler galleries in washington

17:10.029 --> 17:12.164
itself home to any
police body shop

17:14.033 --> 17:17.803
these are France Castres
and woodcarvers

17:17.803 --> 17:19.505
work historically considered you
know among the greatest are to
serve the

17:19.505 --> 17:19.171
region

17:21.707 --> 17:24.176
and they not only worked in
Nepal but they were called to
China

17:26.946 --> 17:29.081
and they worked into that so
they were they were understood
is really important

17:29.081 --> 17:31.217
it's a fact not lost
on locals after

17:32.818 --> 17:33.219
early reports looting man

17:35.755 --> 17:37.123
heart says citizen's police and
the military have come together
to protect

17:38.557 --> 17:39.191
the sites

17:41.694 --> 17:43.195
these are not just relics from a
bygone era he and others point
out

17:45.431 --> 17:49.201
but living history people
interact with on a daily basis

17:49.201 --> 17:53.339
that was on display this
week in the capital

17:53.339 --> 17:55.241
where even amid the destruction
and loss life ni police

17:57.376 --> 17:59.178
celebrated the Buddha's birth
when I arrived in Nepal

18:01.781 --> 18:05.251
I was really struck by the
spirituality of the people by
this living

18:05.251 --> 18:07.219
culture they still have
they go to the temple

18:09.088 --> 18:12.291
every morning to give
some a offerings

18:12.291 --> 18:14.260
each temple has its own
festive errors and the

18:16.462 --> 18:18.230
the people a very strongly
connected and that's part of it

18:20.199 --> 18:23.336
the lice and what is the
danger of course if the

18:23.336 --> 18:26.339
tangible a heritage though
the tempers disappear

18:26.339 --> 18:28.240
that and also the Intangible
Heritage Room the

18:30.776 --> 18:34.914
disappear there are reasons for
some hope the way the temples in
buildings

18:34.914 --> 18:36.849
were constructed for example

18:36.849 --> 18:39.285
should make them easier to
rebuild many of them are in this
very distinctive

18:40.953 --> 18:44.223
Napoli's style that uses brick

18:44.223 --> 18:46.158
and and would so we see
these go to like towers

18:48.728 --> 18:51.230
as many different Ruth and and
struts that are made have carved
wood

18:53.899 --> 18:58.938
and when there's an earthquake
those buildings tend to fall
straight down

18:58.938 --> 19:01.240
and the struts survive and the
brick survive so there's a lot
that can be

19:02.508 --> 19:04.844
recycled

19:04.844 --> 19:09.949
and also we have Ferretti 28
documentation you have good
photographs

19:09.949 --> 19:14.320
of the side so we have for
architectural drawings and plans
we have measurements

19:14.320 --> 19:16.288
so all this helps for
future restoration

19:18.424 --> 19:21.560
man had says that with thousands
have temples to restore

19:21.560 --> 19:23.295
the work could take at least
10 years and perhaps decades

19:25.431 --> 19:28.501
are part of a rebuilding effort
throughout the country

19:28.501 --> 19:31.170
that by all accounts will
require a huge international

19:31.170 --> 19:34.006
eat commitment for
the PBS Newshour

19:34.006 --> 19:40.279
I'm jeffrey Brown in Washington

19:45.684 --> 19:45.317
in a rare

19:48.054 --> 19:50.322
near unanimous and bipartisan
vote the senate declared it
would have it's a an

19:51.957 --> 19:54.427
ongoing nuclear talks with Iran

19:54.427 --> 19:59.065
the Iran nuclear agreement
Review Act passed +98 21

19:59.065 --> 20:01.367
it would give Congress at 02:52
days to review any proposed
nuclear agreement

20:02.701 --> 20:02.334
with Iran

20:04.770 --> 20:08.707
during that time the president
could not reduce imposed
sanctions

20:08.707 --> 20:10.376
and Congress could vote up or
down on any proposed agreement

20:12.945 --> 20:15.681
a two-thirds vote would be
needed to override any resulting
presidential

20:15.681 --> 20:15.381
detail

20:17.917 --> 20:19.351
I spoke earlier with two
senators who joined in the
overwhelming support for

20:20.753 --> 20:21.520
the measure

20:21.520 --> 20:23.355
we begin with Republican
John though not South Dakota

20:26.125 --> 20:28.794
said or written thank you for
joining us so what the congress
feel it had to have

20:28.794 --> 20:30.963
its say today

20:30.963 --> 20:33.365
well I think there's a concern
well among the american people
go and

20:35.968 --> 20:39.038
have in needs to be voice
through their representatives in
Congress about

20:39.038 --> 20:41.373
an Iranian nuclear agreement
that the administration is in
the process have

20:44.076 --> 20:47.713
negotiating I think there's this
has a huge national security
card consequences

20:47.713 --> 20:49.381
not only for our allies in the
region but the United States

20:51.884 --> 20:54.353
and so the the congress in the
legislation we pass a day and it
was an

20:55.855 --> 20:57.356
overwhelming vote

20:57.356 --> 21:00.993
I think went on the
record expressing their

21:00.993 --> 21:02.728
I desire to be a part of this
process and have an opportunity
to at least

21:02.728 --> 21:02.428
review

21:05.131 --> 21:09.034
and in approve or disapprove
whatever agreement the
administration negotiates

21:09.034 --> 21:10.436
you're right that was an
overwhelming vote but even
though only one person

21:12.104 --> 21:12.438
voted against the final bill

21:15.040 --> 21:19.044
several love your colleagues %uh
senator Rubio said a cruise
senator Carr

21:19.044 --> 21:21.413
they had all been a little bit
concerned about give about
seeming to give

21:22.848 --> 21:22.414
congressional

21:25.084 --> 21:29.221
it's good congress' blessing to
any deal how did you overcome
those concerns

21:29.221 --> 21:31.423
right well I think in the end
what they their argument was a
yes you don't want

21:33.526 --> 21:35.561
to have congress on the
record in any way blessing

21:35.561 --> 21:39.598
this thing but the in the
end it's going to take a

21:39.598 --> 21:42.401
basically 67 votes in the
congress for anything

21:43.903 --> 21:46.172
that the president

21:46.172 --> 21:48.841
I should say citing 34 votes to
approve a twenty 67 votes to
disapprove anything

21:51.043 --> 21:53.112
that the administration
negotiate and the one thing that
the legislation does

21:53.946 --> 21:54.480
I think this was probably the
most compelling argument
supportive

21:57.016 --> 21:59.818
getting people on board with
this at least we have an
opportunity reviewer we

21:59.818 --> 22:02.254
get 30 days

22:02.254 --> 22:04.490
it will be an opportunity to
educate the american people
about the particulars

22:04.490 --> 22:05.090
the details at this
thing and what it means

22:07.359 --> 22:09.662
and I think that was probably
the most compelling argument

22:10.729 --> 22:12.898
a in favor love moving for this
legislation which by the way was

22:13.799 --> 22:14.400
negotiated

22:15.534 --> 22:18.737
really by bob Corker
and I had 65 yr 64

22:20.239 --> 22:22.408
cosponsors when it started out
so this story tell that broad
bipartisan support

22:25.044 --> 22:26.478
the president had indicated that
he would veto it and he only
came along

22:28.747 --> 22:30.683
reluctantly when it became clear
that this thing was gonna Paso

22:32.117 --> 22:34.153
I think that this is this is an
important step forward in

22:35.254 --> 22:37.489
insuring that the american
people and members of Congress
have an opportunity

22:38.857 --> 22:38.490
to debate

22:41.093 --> 22:45.264
review and act ultimately on
whatever deal the administration
negotiated but

22:45.264 --> 22:47.700
couldn't the congress did they
have debated be viewed in
enacted

22:48.968 --> 22:50.502
on this even without I do matter
what happened with this deal
couldn't

22:52.137 --> 22:54.173
congresses have done this

22:54.173 --> 22:56.108
anytime well they could but
there was no guarantee that we
would have the

22:56.108 --> 22:56.508
opportunity to see it

22:58.477 --> 23:01.046
the this requires administration
presented

23:02.514 --> 23:04.483
and and you know in in
all its details and

23:06.518 --> 23:07.019
line by line and so congress the
American people going to have a
chance

23:08.387 --> 23:08.821
to see it

23:10.155 --> 23:11.890
arguably there were certain
people probably the would have
had a chance to

23:13.525 --> 23:15.694
to see it anyway but for
the entire congress and

23:17.162 --> 23:18.530
in by virtual that the american
people have an opportunity to
review this deal

23:20.666 --> 23:24.003
it took a process like this
and I think that's why

23:24.003 --> 23:28.140
in the end you know that's what
won it out early on in this one
at the

23:28.140 --> 23:30.009
objections from the white house
and from some Democrats was that
Congress was

23:30.009 --> 23:30.476
going to hurt

23:32.811 --> 23:37.249
the over did the deal still
being negotiated still being
firmed up

23:37.249 --> 23:40.286
in nineteen either the end
however they are this weekend
that would hurt the

23:40.286 --> 23:41.053
overall negotiations

23:41.620 --> 23:43.589
why won't this I think
in the end it gives

23:46.125 --> 23:48.127
gives additional leverage the
administration because now the
iranians

23:49.161 --> 23:49.795
No

23:51.163 --> 23:52.531
the other parties nor allies
know that this is something that
congress is at

23:54.066 --> 23:56.302
least gonna weigh in on

23:56.302 --> 23:59.171
and and I think that's another
threshold that is their
negotiating have to think

23:59.171 --> 23:59.571
about your for example

24:02.041 --> 24:02.574
I had an amendment that
ultimately didn't get voted on
that would have

24:04.243 --> 24:05.611
required the state department

24:05.611 --> 24:07.579
to investigate whether
or not the IAEA I

24:09.648 --> 24:13.152
EA really had the ability
under the agreement

24:13.152 --> 24:14.987
to to take a look at these
military sites to see if the
Iranians were in

24:14.987 --> 24:14.620
compliance

24:17.089 --> 24:18.590
it things like that I think ur
are really important the
American people

24:20.559 --> 24:23.262
things like that I think
are really important to

24:23.262 --> 24:25.764
individual members of congress
and I think the administration
should use that

24:25.764 --> 24:28.200
to their advantage when there
we go shooting this deal

24:28.200 --> 24:30.936
accept your amendment didn't get
those on a lot about amendments
didn't get

24:30.936 --> 24:31.637
voted on they were shut down
by the senate Majority Leader

24:34.273 --> 24:36.175
isn't this it is the thing
republicans use a complaint that
Harry Reid it all

24:36.175 --> 24:36.642
the time well it did

24:39.345 --> 24:42.915
that the democrats had no
interest in in helping on this
because they didn't have

24:42.915 --> 24:43.649
any amendments they offered they
wanted to see the bill move for

24:46.285 --> 24:48.821
for without amendment we had a
number of members in our site
you didn't wanna

24:48.821 --> 24:52.324
offer amendments the democrats
objected in Black Hills

24:52.324 --> 24:55.294
in the year and we want to get
the bill passed and yes it would
have been nice

24:55.294 --> 24:57.162
to have a debate about
amendments more so those
amendments ultimately would

24:57.162 --> 24:56.662
have been defeated

24:59.198 --> 25:00.632
it would be nice to think that
we could have even strengthen
the bill

25:03.268 --> 25:04.636
before it passed but if I'm the
white house I look at this
entire process and

25:06.772 --> 25:09.241
say you know this is good for
us because this gives us

25:09.241 --> 25:11.643
is we negotiate a stronger hand
and I think in the end that
enables them

25:14.113 --> 25:15.647
if they're willing to use that
to get a better deal senator
john

25:18.217 --> 25:21.653
thing in a South Dakota thank
you very much thanks when I also
spoke with

25:21.653 --> 25:22.654
virginia's democratic
senator Tim Kaine

25:25.257 --> 25:28.193
senator mccain thank you for
joining us it is so unusual to
see such an

25:28.193 --> 25:29.695
overwhelming bipartisan
agreement how significant was
this vote today

25:32.064 --> 25:35.834
it was a huge role when both for
what it means and what it
portends

25:35.834 --> 25:37.703
you know this was a bill
that was introduced in 2014

25:40.205 --> 25:42.674
by fourteen republican senator
corker and 13 other Republicans
a very

25:44.977 --> 25:46.678
partisan bill but we started to
work on it together in January

25:49.314 --> 25:51.950
recognizing the state's an
Iranian nuclear negotiations
nothin play around

25:51.950 --> 25:51.650
with

25:53.886 --> 25:56.989
and we made some significant
changes to turn it into a

25:56.989 --> 25:58.924
a bipartisan bill after
some other drama in

26:00.859 --> 26:03.862
February in and March here in
the senate the letter A 47 to
the supreme leader

26:05.397 --> 26:08.867
we felt like we needed to show
I'm each other and our public
that we could

26:08.867 --> 26:10.736
consider an important matter
like and deal with Iran

26:13.038 --> 26:14.706
in a way that was delivered
have and prompt in bipartisan

26:17.176 --> 26:17.709
and when we got the bill done in
the Foreign Relations Committee
where I

26:19.311 --> 26:21.246
serve on a unanimous vote

26:21.246 --> 26:22.714
and we got a 98 one vote on the
floor today it shows that the
senate

26:25.150 --> 26:26.885
can step up and take these
responsibilities on our
shoulders and do

26:27.586 --> 26:27.820
them well

26:29.321 --> 26:31.990
now we have to do the same thing
with this nine-month war against
I so what's

26:31.990 --> 26:31.690
going on

26:34.326 --> 26:37.029
well you know the white house
had originally at some point
maybe it was

26:37.029 --> 26:40.032
about the time I this 47 the
Republican signing the letter

26:40.032 --> 26:41.733
to the ayatollah I they had said
that they would be tailed this

26:44.470 --> 26:47.372
yep watch what changed well I
think you know it one we got the
votes you know we

26:48.240 --> 26:48.841
we had we had an

26:50.242 --> 26:52.711
undeniable momentum for this
bill but I also think the White
House

26:53.946 --> 26:55.914
as they look at it they realized
something on

26:57.316 --> 27:01.587
if the choice was between
congressional engagement or no
engagement

27:01.587 --> 27:03.889
this white house and probably
ever wide every other white
house would prefer no

27:04.823 --> 27:05.224
engagement

27:06.492 --> 27:08.794
but that was never really the
choice because the white house
is negotiating

27:11.096 --> 27:13.765
with Iran using a congressional
impose sanctions regime as the

27:16.168 --> 27:18.103
as the lever in the negotiation
we were always going to be
involved

27:19.505 --> 27:21.306
so once they realize that
the real choice was between

27:22.407 --> 27:24.776
disc on Kristen gage under a set
of rules that is prompt and
careful and

27:26.178 --> 27:26.345
well-defined

27:28.313 --> 27:30.415
or this congress engage kinda
under a free-for-all set of
rules

27:31.517 --> 27:34.119
they realize that the better
course was to have a careful
review and that's what

27:36.054 --> 27:38.657
we've we've done we've given the
president

27:38.657 --> 27:40.459
the ability to do waver a vague
executive for international
sanctions

27:40.225 --> 27:40.759
without congress

27:43.095 --> 27:46.064
but when he proposes relief
under the congressional statute
then we enter a

27:46.431 --> 27:46.798
review period thats prompt

27:49.401 --> 27:52.070
and then we have to render
either an approval or
disapproval or take no

27:52.070 --> 27:52.271
action

27:53.705 --> 27:56.475
so that we can quickly you
know give a congressional

27:58.744 --> 28:00.045
you can a signal about what we
would intend and that's the
right way to do

28:00.946 --> 28:01.980
this now you mentioned the

28:03.148 --> 28:05.884
ongoing conflict with I so he
spoke about that on the senate

28:05.884 --> 28:09.454
for today do you envision
this as a blueprint for

28:09.454 --> 28:10.856
congressional action on other
international issues I would
only to be

28:12.624 --> 28:12.791
the purview of the
executive branch

28:15.060 --> 28:16.795
I i really do when a dove course
the executive branch's uge

28:18.964 --> 28:22.935
per view on matters of diplomacy
and also on matters of

28:22.935 --> 28:26.104
of war but congress has our
progress as well and non

28:26.104 --> 28:29.474
are so important as the power
the Congress to declare war

28:29.474 --> 28:31.843
today is the end up nine months
%uh unilateral executive or
without a single

28:33.111 --> 28:32.811
vote

28:35.380 --> 28:38.116
on the floor either house of
Congress about whether we should
be engaged

28:38.116 --> 28:42.487
in military action against I saw
it's been incredibly frustrating

28:42.487 --> 28:44.189
but what I saw happen in the
Foreign Relations committee over
the last month

28:44.189 --> 28:43.855
or so

28:46.291 --> 28:47.859
coming together and try to
tackle a tough issue consistent
with our

28:49.261 --> 28:50.896
responsibilities

28:50.896 --> 28:54.466
in a bipartisan way I think what
happened today

28:54.466 --> 28:58.270
portends that we can use the
same approach is we as we
grapple with the

28:58.270 --> 28:59.838
president's proposed
authorization for the worgen
sisal

29:02.574 --> 29:05.310
we should be putting our service
members lives at risk unless
Congress is willing

29:05.310 --> 29:04.910
to have a debate

29:07.546 --> 29:10.182
and say that the mission is in
the national interest now I ask
senator john

29:10.182 --> 29:11.883
10 this not that short time
ago and I want to ask you to

29:14.119 --> 29:17.556
harder the criticism about
congressional intervention here

29:17.556 --> 29:17.923
is that you were going to
endanger the ultimate agreement
which still hasn't

29:19.291 --> 29:21.193
come to fruition

29:21.193 --> 29:22.894
out with State Senator John
Kerry's been involved when with

29:25.163 --> 29:26.865
do you anticipate that this will
make his job tougher easier

29:29.568 --> 29:33.639
I i think it'll make it easier
when I look i I take that
concerns seriously

29:33.639 --> 29:35.874
that's why I did not agree and
have not agreed to be part of
any sanctions

29:37.275 --> 29:38.543
legislation

29:38.543 --> 29:39.945
during the course in the
negotiation with Iran because
the terms and the

29:41.613 --> 29:44.216
negotiations said we wouldn't do

29:44.216 --> 29:45.884
any more sanctions while we were
negotiating but the term to the

29:48.020 --> 29:50.422
negotiation didn't say
that congress couldn't

29:50.422 --> 29:54.126
sign off on the deal indeed the
deal that's being negotiated is
one

29:54.126 --> 29:55.961
that the Iranian parliament
has to sign off on and

29:58.397 --> 29:59.931
a runny in leaders are very
sophisticated about our
political system

30:02.067 --> 30:05.570
if they want out from under
congressional sanctions

30:05.570 --> 30:06.938
they understand that congress is
going to have a say so the fact
that congress

30:08.373 --> 30:09.875
will weigh and

30:09.875 --> 30:11.076
once a deal was done
if a deal is done

30:13.178 --> 30:15.047
is not surprising to them
they've anticipated from the
beginning

30:16.181 --> 30:19.251
that will not cause these
negotiations to go off the rails

30:19.251 --> 30:20.952
senator Tim Kaine democrat a
virginia thank you very much

30:22.354 --> 30:28.860
thanks when in

30:32.664 --> 30:35.801
Baltimore Mayor Stephanie
rawlings-blake today announced a
new effort to tackle

30:35.801 --> 30:38.503
the city's
long-standing problems

30:38.503 --> 30:41.707
the one Baltimore campaign as
it's called is designed to bring
business

30:41.707 --> 30:42.007
religious and community groups

30:44.710 --> 30:47.979
together to help rebuild the
city given the city's difficult
history the mayor's

30:49.514 --> 30:51.049
initiative reflects concern
about the potential

30:52.584 --> 30:55.587
long-term told the latest
upheaval could leave on sum up
its already most

30:55.587 --> 30:57.522
troubled neighborhoods

30:57.522 --> 30:59.024
economics correspondent Paul
Solman went to Baltimore to take
a look

31:01.259 --> 31:02.961
part of our ongoing reporting on
making sense a financial news

31:04.963 --> 31:09.668
which airs every Thursday
on the news hour

31:11.503 --> 31:14.406
the Southern Baptist Church in
straight stricken Baltimore

31:14.406 --> 31:16.174
this annual celebration of
the area's church archer's

31:17.576 --> 31:19.444
seem jarring given the
lost the pastor don t

31:21.446 --> 31:24.683
it means flock suffered last
week there half-built senior
housing complex and

31:24.449 --> 31:25.050
community center

31:27.185 --> 31:29.054
torch fully a third the
twelve million dollar project

31:31.089 --> 31:34.192
reduced to rubble within
hours so to the church bus

31:35.360 --> 31:39.030
it was heartbreaking we built
invested in the community and

31:40.932 --> 31:42.334
who would do something like this
but they're asking a bigger
question in the

31:43.468 --> 31:45.670
city at large

31:45.670 --> 31:49.474
went to last week's events
portend for the economy a
baltimore as a whole

31:49.474 --> 31:51.510
on relatively
up-scale Federal Hill

31:52.644 --> 31:55.347
the market's boy real estate
firm colloquially known as
willing bill on

31:55.347 --> 31:55.080
the hill

31:57.149 --> 31:59.050
business was off by
roughly a hundred percent

32:01.119 --> 32:03.488
these are the ones that were
cancel consider co owner will
run about

32:04.923 --> 32:06.725
says buyers and renters are
staying away in droves

32:09.027 --> 32:11.429
the phones not been ringing and
no one's been walking and as for
investors

32:13.632 --> 32:15.033
we have two properties on the
market right now with a
commercial retail

32:16.234 --> 32:16.535
presence on the first floor

32:18.904 --> 32:21.339
and then multiple apartments
above those type A properties
have been extremely

32:22.307 --> 32:24.576
popular and now this week
we've seen a drastic decline

32:26.444 --> 32:29.147
in request even see them in the
similarly trendy Fells Point

32:29.447 --> 32:28.980
neighborhood

32:31.016 --> 32:34.686
the boutique hotel
in at the black our

32:34.686 --> 32:37.155
suffered the same fate I'd never
experienced anything in my
lifetime like

32:37.656 --> 32:37.656
this

32:38.390 --> 32:41.660
co owner demetrius pleaaase says
he was swamped by cancellations

32:44.029 --> 32:45.497
we were at a hundred percent
occupancy this is the busy
season

32:46.798 --> 32:50.168
and had to give refunds
we lost all reservations

32:51.236 --> 32:54.706
we lost a buncha parties
price will cut by two-thirds

32:54.706 --> 32:58.043
occupancy was cut by two-thirds
at least in baltimore's famously
revived Inner

32:59.377 --> 33:00.779
Harbor

33:00.779 --> 33:03.648
economic consultant under bond
Basu's summed up this is really
hammered the

33:05.650 --> 33:07.786
lesion hospitality segment
the city of Baltimore

33:07.686 --> 33:08.420
we've had bars there

33:10.589 --> 33:12.357
lost about 95 percent of their
normal business traffic

33:14.159 --> 33:15.493
we've had a number of wheels
games canceled including one
that took place

33:16.561 --> 33:18.763
with no fans

33:18.763 --> 33:20.232
and of course there's the direct
damage from the ride on Monday
night

33:22.534 --> 33:24.069
that's gonna make it that much
more difficult to market this
city not just a

33:24.836 --> 33:24.536
Taurus

33:26.972 --> 33:29.341
but to students who attend Johns
Hopkins or loyal university or
the US mail in

33:30.675 --> 33:30.242
Baltimore

33:32.711 --> 33:34.145
people who are being recruited
for corporate positions at Under
Armour T

33:35.113 --> 33:35.513
rowe Price Legg Mason

33:37.782 --> 33:40.118
and other businesses in
Baltimore City and so anyone who
thinks that these

33:40.118 --> 33:41.219
effects won't linger
i think is naive

33:42.387 --> 33:44.422
I grew up in Detroit and
I remember the 1967

33:46.791 --> 33:48.360
rights economic historian Robert
margo doesn't just remember the
nineteen

33:49.728 --> 33:51.429
sixties right

33:51.429 --> 33:55.667
its he studied their effects in
dozens of cities across the US

33:55.667 --> 33:58.837
the riots were unambiguously
negative they

33:58.837 --> 34:00.705
reduced incomes and
african-americans employment

34:03.008 --> 34:06.711
and the reduced housing values
local amenities shopping firms
like this

34:06.711 --> 34:08.446
basically went away and I would
also add that these were not

34:11.016 --> 34:14.686
transient effects they persisted
we found no evidence that they
got better

34:14.619 --> 34:16.221
so to speak

34:18.823 --> 34:22.327
I want them off and just turned
around and came right
sociologist Chris Marsh

34:22.327 --> 34:24.229
for the most part where we
saw the hotbed up there

34:26.665 --> 34:28.233
rodney king riots there haven't
been a lot of reinvestment back
in that

34:29.534 --> 34:29.167
community

34:31.670 --> 34:33.204
nor was there much reinvestment
in baltimore's affected
neighborhoods

34:35.206 --> 34:38.109
after the eight-day
uprising here in 1968

34:38.109 --> 34:40.178
so much was left done
so much was left

34:42.080 --> 34:44.549
without being rebuilt but if the
effects of the last rites are
there for

34:44.716 --> 34:46.251
anyone to see why

34:48.820 --> 34:51.523
heard Muslims and Terrence
Rogers a minister in training
under pastor

34:51.523 --> 34:51.256
hickman

34:53.458 --> 34:57.762
as our Darien right Nicholas
Johnson that area my sport

34:57.762 --> 34:59.230
was already destroyed people art
building like they can succeed
in life

35:00.632 --> 35:01.900
will get above

35:01.900 --> 35:03.234
when they're at their boiling
point when it comes to them
lashing out

35:05.236 --> 35:09.574
was the worst that can
happen is already

35:09.574 --> 35:12.444
falling down around us is like
we all live in in this this

35:12.444 --> 35:17.015
this double theirs was a and
yet barely two miles away

35:17.015 --> 35:20.251
Baltimore has been booming over
there is a Four Seasons Hotel
you'll see a crane

35:21.519 --> 35:22.287
their

35:22.287 --> 35:24.255
on top of that is being
constructed nine stories

35:26.257 --> 35:29.828
luxury condominiums over
there you can see the

35:29.828 --> 35:31.296
new regional headquarters a x1
under construction and that is
going to

35:32.831 --> 35:34.466
energize development

35:34.466 --> 35:36.267
on a peninsula known as
Harbor Point baltimore's most

35:38.870 --> 35:41.673
upscale neighborhood this is all
Inner Harbor years is all the
inner harbor of

35:41.673 --> 35:41.306
baltimore

35:43.541 --> 35:46.978
I was no longer goals that
these were riding peers and

35:46.978 --> 35:49.280
there are rats are running all
over the place now today it is a
showpiece for

35:50.715 --> 35:50.281
urban america

35:52.283 --> 35:54.352
the city's driving and
driving at the same time

35:56.054 --> 35:58.723
local real estate investor John
the mayor Jin I hate to say it
but

35:59.457 --> 36:03.161
my life over the last week
was almost totally on

36:03.161 --> 36:05.296
change which seems
a little unfair

36:07.399 --> 36:11.269
being in a city that was writing
at an urban buses office

36:11.269 --> 36:13.238
his young employees
seemed even less phased

36:15.573 --> 36:18.343
how many have you would tell
your friends from other cities

36:18.343 --> 36:21.746
a you still wanna come
to Baltimore every way

36:23.548 --> 36:25.617
I would say the Baltimore still
attractive

36:27.018 --> 36:31.790
location prefer my age group I
think we were just the alarm
normal life after

36:31.790 --> 36:34.325
is if the writing goes away and
the destruction of property goes
away

36:36.761 --> 36:38.963
mostly will forget about it why
have young professionals flocked
here

36:40.965 --> 36:44.335
less than an hour from
washington Baltimore housing is
a third the price

36:45.570 --> 36:48.440
one reason the stigma
the city's riding

36:49.908 --> 36:55.013
core and with the recent unrest
housing may become even more
affordable

36:55.013 --> 36:57.282
but that's what worries
sociologist Chris Marrs it in
some way this is prime

36:58.616 --> 36:58.283
property

37:00.685 --> 37:03.822
so you may have the big
developers want to come in and
push up

37:03.822 --> 37:07.392
brown what folks intensified and
now make it my PC in DC this new

37:08.326 --> 37:10.795
area for young white
folks with 2.5 kids and

37:12.197 --> 37:13.965
Priya's when I look around
his place behind us there

37:15.500 --> 37:17.635
there there I miss
a whole block its

37:17.902 --> 37:19.571
got nobody living in

37:19.571 --> 37:21.406
at all gentrification is
better than that right that's

37:23.975 --> 37:25.376
one way you could look at it but
how about trying to invest in
the people

37:26.644 --> 37:27.712
there

37:27.712 --> 37:29.380
already here one-third of the
people who shop at this mall

37:31.816 --> 37:34.719
make within twenty five thousand
dollars a year at the mondawmin
mall

37:34.719 --> 37:37.388
where last week's rioting began
historian Ethan Conley told us

37:40.024 --> 37:43.728
that perhaps what happened in
Baltimore will galvanize such
investment

37:43.728 --> 37:45.396
10 my hopes in fact is that
this ride will really begin to

37:47.999 --> 37:49.701
initiate a conversation about it
government jobs program that
really will

37:49.701 --> 37:49.400
address

37:51.903 --> 37:53.838
the problem underemployment in
black neighborhoods but that's
because

37:53.838 --> 37:55.106
taxpayer money

37:55.106 --> 37:57.408
and in United States in 2015

37:59.978 --> 38:03.982
taxpayers are particularly
interested in making those kinds
of the best

38:03.982 --> 38:05.416
historically that's actually
true and it's unfortunate
because when the

38:07.318 --> 38:08.153
reasons we've gotten
into this mess

38:08.153 --> 38:10.421
is willing to except taxes for

38:13.091 --> 38:15.960
increasing policing or not
willing to accept taxes for
anti-poverty vertically

38:15.960 --> 38:17.095
anti-poverty measures

38:17.095 --> 38:20.398
targeting communities of color

38:20.398 --> 38:23.568
so maybe the obstacles are
insurmountable

38:23.568 --> 38:27.338
but pastor dante hickman has
a reminder for skeptics

38:27.338 --> 38:30.475
economic and spiritual
life gardens

38:31.709 --> 38:33.912
way

38:33.912 --> 38:36.447
I think opposition lends itself
when you are resilient and
faithful

38:38.449 --> 38:42.453
to greater opportunities
up bro hand at least

38:43.955 --> 38:46.724
all prayed for that economics
correspondent Paul Solman

38:47.492 --> 38:51.029
reporting for the PBS
Newshour from Baltimore

38:51.029 --> 38:54.432
we'll have more on Baltimore
online economist John Carlos
breaks down

38:56.768 --> 38:59.537
some startling statistics about
income inequality in the city

38:59.537 --> 39:01.472
on our home page PBS a
dork slash newshour

39:04.008 --> 39:09.380
over the past few months
newshour student reporting labs
have been looking

39:15.119 --> 39:15.486
into school campus safety

39:18.056 --> 39:19.891
in Arizona one group of our high
school students has been asked
to play an

39:19.891 --> 39:22.093
important role

39:22.093 --> 39:24.095
and making sure everyone on
campus knows what to do in an
emergency

39:26.264 --> 39:28.499
the NewsHour sable brown worked
with some other students for our
latest

39:29.968 --> 39:32.170
American graduate report part of
a public media initiative funded
by the

39:33.404 --> 39:35.673
corporation for
public broadcasting

39:35.673 --> 39:41.412
those are words no school
administrator wants to say

39:44.015 --> 39:48.253
room 160 it scared

39:48.253 --> 39:49.520
in the two years since the mass
shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary in Connecticut

39:51.789 --> 39:55.026
schools around the country have
been ramping up safety efforts

39:55.026 --> 39:56.928
and experimenting with different
approaches to prepare for
worst-case

39:56.928 --> 39:57.629
scenarios

39:59.664 --> 40:01.766
one High School in Phoenix
challenge students

40:02.800 --> 40:07.305
to help make their schools safer
during a reverse evacuation

40:07.305 --> 40:09.540
student administrators asked
journalism student at South
Mountain High School

40:12.210 --> 40:15.647
to create a video for their
peers on what to do during
emergency situations

40:15.647 --> 40:19.083
principal accretion
Williams made the request

40:19.083 --> 40:20.585
after potentially dangerous
incident caused a lockdown in
the fall

40:22.687 --> 40:23.554
there at lunch at this time
there eating having fun

40:26.024 --> 40:29.827
and and so we literally push the
kids into buildings there right
you know

40:31.095 --> 40:32.030
they're walking faster
now running cuz

40:33.197 --> 40:36.267
may don't know that the
seriousness avid that there's an
alleged person who has a

40:36.267 --> 40:37.869
weapon on campus with a backpack

40:40.538 --> 40:42.740
the response to that incident
wasn't as smooth as school
officials had hoped

40:44.075 --> 40:47.278
goes back to an old sports
cliche which is you

40:47.278 --> 40:49.013
play like to practice have
security Brian McNeill says

40:50.882 --> 40:53.251
regular drills are important
we are marked them

40:54.052 --> 40:56.654
in the back the Rosetta
themselves the whole purpose of
a lockdown

40:58.589 --> 41:00.725
is to minimize casualties
and we know the

41:03.261 --> 41:06.230
sometimes in depending on the
situation we're not going to be
100 percent

41:06.064 --> 41:08.866
you can't you

41:10.201 --> 41:13.271
good we tried to

41:13.738 --> 41:15.573
everybody inside and
securities fast as we can

41:17.842 --> 41:22.280
senior Jose Contreras the lead
producer the student video

41:22.280 --> 41:25.650
says it's been clear for some
time that students need more
information

41:25.650 --> 41:27.885
some classrooms liked
their doors before

41:30.488 --> 41:32.757
other students were and some
students were picking out that
they can get in

41:33.624 --> 41:35.593
Nick created a lotta
chaos and a lot of fear

41:37.528 --> 41:40.832
even to some students many
students were unaware that
teachers are supposed to

41:41.766 --> 41:42.100
lock classroom doors immediately

41:44.235 --> 41:46.070
in many emergency situation
at any Montgomery did

41:48.039 --> 41:50.942
during the drill we were
allowed to film and after that

41:51.809 --> 41:53.678
me it's very important that
we be quiet on that we

41:55.747 --> 41:56.080
we go in our little room are
there in close the door and make
the room look

41:57.248 --> 41:57.715
like it's empty

41:59.117 --> 42:02.186
on and that they bring all their
backpacks and belonging so if
someone

42:02.186 --> 42:02.653
did make it into the main room
they would think this place was
empty

42:04.956 --> 42:06.624
it's a little worse than
worrying about hola at South
Mountain

42:09.360 --> 42:12.130
teachers like the Camry have
written instructions detailee
how to respond to

42:12.130 --> 42:12.764
various emergency

42:14.399 --> 42:17.101
once you become aware this year
they also watched a new training
video

42:17.935 --> 42:20.838
developed with guidance from
first responders educators

42:20.838 --> 42:22.673
mental health professionals
and law enforcement

42:25.343 --> 42:28.112
recent events remind us that
active shooter incidents can
occur anywhere in

42:28.112 --> 42:27.678
our community

42:30.248 --> 42:33.351
when I first watched the video I
cried this really hard to deal
with that

42:33.351 --> 42:35.653
our children can be put in the
care danger Irene D as is the
Phoenix Union

42:37.688 --> 42:39.824
High School District
Supervisor for security

42:39.824 --> 42:42.927
she says the active
shooter action plan video

42:42.927 --> 42:44.662
has helped teachers and staff
become better prepared

42:47.265 --> 42:49.934
we were training our staff with
you get small get quiet we need
to do something

42:49.934 --> 42:50.101
to train

42:52.437 --> 42:54.739
our teachers to prepare them so
that more more kids you survey
should in turn

42:55.173 --> 42:54.672
out like that per

42:57.008 --> 43:00.378
the video though it was
considered inappropriate for
students

43:00.378 --> 43:02.680
and they never saw it but it's
part of the research for their
own video

43:05.349 --> 43:07.418
the journalism students met with
Deborah rep ki the head of the
nonprofit that

43:07.418 --> 43:07.752
created the one for teachers

43:10.221 --> 43:11.722
otherwise I think you guys again
are doing this a really good job
she

43:13.724 --> 43:16.327
suggested they consider
addressing situations

43:16.327 --> 43:18.729
that could come up in an
emergency there could be
situations where you have

43:21.499 --> 43:26.437
rooms that are not lockable so
what is a substitute teacher
what is a student do

43:26.437 --> 43:28.840
in that situation before if
someone happens to be in the
restroom during a

43:29.474 --> 43:29.941
lockdown

43:31.409 --> 43:33.744
a scenario included in the
student's final cut hide inside
the stopper that's

43:35.279 --> 43:40.451
the way from the door

43:40.451 --> 43:41.786
I think for additional
information the young
journalists also interviewed

43:43.321 --> 43:45.289
students and teachers

43:45.289 --> 43:47.959
to learn more about their
schools current emergency
protocols

43:47.959 --> 43:50.761
including what was and wasn't
working history teacher

43:52.296 --> 43:56.234
using room we found

43:56.234 --> 43:58.769
weak spot with our school with
and specifically our department
I

44:01.439 --> 44:05.676
with accessibility you were able
to get through my class would
have access to

44:05.676 --> 44:05.776
all the other
teachers classrooms

44:07.712 --> 44:11.082
within my department
has been addressed

44:11.082 --> 44:13.784
lot two-way locks on doors how
effective which said it yourself

44:15.620 --> 44:18.823
why I fired rose
that which perot's

44:18.823 --> 44:21.826
all I'll all I have been
efficient as I feel the

44:23.928 --> 44:25.796
to be other firsts along we have
November for example

44:27.732 --> 44:30.668
very poor are created
a fire hazard

44:30.668 --> 44:32.770
at the I'll choke
point or stadium

44:34.772 --> 44:38.376
it turns out many people
noticed that problem

44:38.376 --> 44:41.379
describe to me what happens when
you've got fifteen hundred kids
going to the

44:41.379 --> 44:42.813
football field at once

44:42.813 --> 44:45.983
you get to the acting I
mean if you can imagine

44:45.983 --> 44:47.785
so many its sold it to
shoulder trying to get inside

44:49.820 --> 44:52.857
book deal you know
people starving I'll

44:52.857 --> 44:55.826
it just creates more
problems one already

44:58.362 --> 45:00.565
the student journalists shared
what they learned with
administrators

45:00.565 --> 45:01.832
and even though it wasn't news
principal the crucial Williams
wanted to hear

45:04.001 --> 45:08.506
she recognized its value we
have a lot of work to do

45:08.506 --> 45:11.776
we're working you know there's
one liter take care that and
them on covering

45:11.776 --> 45:11.876
those gaps in
communicating them to S

45:13.544 --> 45:17.381
that's just black gold we needed

45:17.381 --> 45:21.485
but even after addressing those
problems there has been one
issue

45:21.485 --> 45:22.887
that keeps coming up you ever
tell you appears to take you
seriously

45:24.522 --> 45:26.891
or precious critical for I

45:29.493 --> 45:31.896
well sometimes I do feel
pressure to lockers bacon but
you don't want to be

45:33.130 --> 45:32.797
the one

45:34.365 --> 45:38.502
that not students for me

45:38.502 --> 45:40.871
by an com as a contrast hopes
the video will change a few
minds about that

45:43.107 --> 45:47.445
not everything is a chill
sometimes real stuff does happen

45:47.445 --> 45:49.880
people need to realize that the
South Mountain journalism
students hope to

45:51.482 --> 45:52.917
eventually distribute their
video to other schools

45:54.251 --> 45:59.790
that requested for the PBS
Newshour I maple brown in
Phoenix

46:05.096 --> 46:07.398
in

46:07.398 --> 46:10.868
after the 2003 invasion of Iraq
British Middle East expert EMA
Skye

46:13.537 --> 46:16.574
joined the US British civilian
operation there advising
Coalition Provisional

46:16.574 --> 46:19.644
Authority chief paul Bremer

46:19.644 --> 46:21.912
and top US military commanders
including generals David
Petraeus and radioed here

46:23.180 --> 46:24.248
now

46:24.248 --> 46:25.950
EMA Skye explores the mistakes
that I made in her new book

46:28.052 --> 46:31.222
the unraveling high hopes
and missed opportunities

46:31.222 --> 46:32.957
in Iraq in the latest addition
to the NewsHour bookshelf

46:35.593 --> 46:36.861
chief foreign affairs
correspondent margaret Warner
talk to her at Busboys

46:38.262 --> 46:39.563
and poets

46:39.563 --> 46:44.702
a local washington bookstore and
the sky welcome thank you for
joining us

46:44.702 --> 46:47.972
cue you opposed the Iraq war
from start what drove you then
to volunteer to go

46:50.041 --> 46:50.908
to help rebuild the country
after the invasion

46:53.544 --> 46:56.247
work but this is my opportunity
to go to Iraq to apologize the
iraqi people for

46:56.247 --> 46:55.980
the war

46:58.315 --> 47:01.218
British government also
volunteers they said it would
just be

47:01.218 --> 47:02.953
three months before we hand the
country back to the iraqis

47:04.622 --> 47:07.958
I've got some skills I can help

47:07.958 --> 47:11.062
rebuild I can help
conflict mediation now

47:11.062 --> 47:14.565
institutional Department
what was the fatal mistake

47:14.565 --> 47:16.967
above the Americans and the
British I mean at what point did
become the

47:18.769 --> 47:22.239
unraveling there
were many mistakes

47:22.239 --> 47:23.974
all the way along so often
in Beijing there was no plan

47:25.976 --> 47:29.113
for what should be done
and the invading forces

47:29.113 --> 47:32.283
didn't have enough troops
there was a power vacuum

47:32.283 --> 47:33.984
all these different gang started
to form then there was the bath

47:36.554 --> 47:38.322
the cation dissolve in the
military and all this led to the
collapse of the

47:38.322 --> 47:38.022
state

47:40.291 --> 47:41.992
and then the Civil War he said
you thought the big mistake was

47:44.729 --> 47:47.565
for the Americans and the
British to try to get iraq to
reorganize on the basis

47:47.565 --> 47:50.668
of ethnicity and sex act

47:50.668 --> 47:53.037
what was the alternative I think
the alternative was to create
the censored

47:54.638 --> 47:58.209
iraqi us and you organized based

47:58.209 --> 48:00.077
on regions and towns as you
don't say we will have

48:02.179 --> 48:04.048
20 percent sony's 20 percent
could sixty percent

48:06.250 --> 48:08.686
Shia you actually think will
have representatives from

48:08.686 --> 48:11.655
bus to from and ball from beale

48:11.655 --> 48:11.989
and that way you're building up

48:14.358 --> 48:16.060
geographical representation
not based on sector ethnicity

48:18.195 --> 48:20.030
instead we wanted to build
a pluralistic society

48:22.166 --> 48:23.968
but what listed wills
institution I sectarianism

48:26.504 --> 48:29.473
so there was nothing about being
iraqi it was all about being a
sub

48:29.473 --> 48:33.210
components paul Bremer dash you
to come to baghdad as his
adviser

48:33.210 --> 48:36.080
talks about that I write the
answer to February 2004

48:38.282 --> 48:40.050
by that stage it was very clear
things were not going well

48:41.752 --> 48:45.723
we had the Apple grape scandal

48:45.723 --> 48:50.361
we had uprisings in furniture
but uprisings in the south with
the Sadrists

48:50.361 --> 48:53.063
and at the Palace we've ever
being balms rocketed into always

48:55.099 --> 48:59.670
sound of gunfire it was
a very dangerous time

48:59.670 --> 49:01.505
and there is a sense that
everything is starting to go
downhill rapidly

49:03.174 --> 49:05.643
and yet you say
ambassador bremer

49:06.410 --> 49:08.078
didn't see it that way when
is optimism become delusional

49:10.648 --> 49:12.516
and one local ambassador graham
is trying to lead in these very
difficult

49:12.516 --> 49:13.050
circumstances

49:15.219 --> 49:18.789
remember the farewell party
had for us and he said

49:18.789 --> 49:20.090
you know for the rest of your
lives to remember how you
brought democracy to

49:21.392 --> 49:21.091
Iraq

49:23.427 --> 49:26.831
and thus the bombs and rockets
were going from the background

49:26.831 --> 49:29.166
but there's a lot I'm going to
remember not trying to remember
the democracy but

49:30.568 --> 49:34.038
now what's it like for
you first evolved

49:34.038 --> 49:37.408
fairly progressive young
woman from Britain

49:37.408 --> 49:39.076
who are suddenly sitting at
the right hand and advising

49:41.345 --> 49:45.616
these powerful american generals
and living with the US military

49:45.616 --> 49:51.355
question huge cultural
shock I mean my life

49:51.355 --> 49:54.491
i'd never work with any military
before let alone the US military

49:54.491 --> 49:56.093
before I got iraq the initial
interaction was a lot of
friction

49:57.761 --> 50:01.866
I came to see quite early on but

50:01.866 --> 50:04.501
these guys wanted to do the
right thing they wanted to
stabilize Iraq so they

50:04.501 --> 50:05.469
could leave

50:05.469 --> 50:08.172
and they had capabilities had
good leaders they had resources

50:10.174 --> 50:14.278
so I calculated my
best use of my skills

50:14.278 --> 50:17.181
was to help them be better
what they were doing

50:19.717 --> 50:22.152
but in 2010 after quelling the
Sunni Shia civil war and al
Qaeda

50:24.221 --> 50:27.725
the American sky says
made a fateful mistake

50:27.725 --> 50:31.695
throwing their weight behind
Shiite prime Minister Nouri al
Maliki

50:31.695 --> 50:36.467
after he narrowly lost the 2010
election against a non-sectarian
rival

50:36.467 --> 50:39.169
there was a sense all do we
uphold the election results

50:41.772 --> 50:46.310
or do we keep my luck in power
general odno was you know we're
Americans

50:46.310 --> 50:49.780
has been an election we
must uphold the results the

50:49.780 --> 50:52.182
others who thought we know my
lucky he will give us a
follow-on security

50:53.517 --> 50:54.084
agreement

50:54.084 --> 50:56.153
so that was the
debate unfortunately

50:58.789 --> 51:00.157
Vice President Biden came down
on the side old there's no one
but Maliki

51:02.259 --> 51:05.029
this is the quickest
option keep the status quo

51:05.029 --> 51:08.232
and weaken get a
security agreement

51:08.232 --> 51:10.234
and then just really
disengage which is what

51:12.770 --> 51:14.171
Washington wanted to kill
washington wants it and the wall
that was the

51:15.439 --> 51:16.707
priority

51:16.707 --> 51:21.178
and the war so what is the
future now that you see for a
wrap

51:22.713 --> 51:26.517
iraq's present is really

51:26.517 --> 51:30.521
Boeing coram got Islamic state
controlling third of the country

51:30.521 --> 51:32.256
reba love us who've served in
Iraq year after year after year

51:34.458 --> 51:37.194
it's really hard and I think the
only way is to maintain hope

51:39.797 --> 51:43.367
is to look at iraq's past
anything you know this is the
land where

51:43.367 --> 51:45.235
had a mini were the land
with the Talmud was written

51:47.338 --> 51:50.874
baghdad was once cultural
capital the Arab world

51:50.874 --> 51:53.510
that is an amazing history and
hope a new generation comes
along that's

51:53.510 --> 51:55.779
inspired

51:55.779 --> 51:57.247
by rocks incredible past and
that's able to build a better
future

51:59.083 --> 52:05.189

our I that might

52:13.931 --> 52:14.231
be of interest to you too

52:16.500 --> 52:19.003

room for the world's first

52:19.003 --> 52:23.073
self-driving 18-wheeler truck

52:23.073 --> 52:25.309
the time where Freightliner
inspiration is now authorized
for a test drive San

52:27.745 --> 52:29.313
public wrote in a battle with a
state license but the semis
won't be

52:31.882 --> 52:35.552
completely autonomous there will
always be a license truck driver
and the sea

52:35.552 --> 52:37.321
the goal is to reduce driver
fatigue on long-haul trips

52:39.923 --> 52:42.826
but tracking unions are wary of
the change it it might yet take
some time to

52:42.826 --> 52:43.293
persuade lawmakers

52:45.929 --> 52:51.769
and the public that it's a on
