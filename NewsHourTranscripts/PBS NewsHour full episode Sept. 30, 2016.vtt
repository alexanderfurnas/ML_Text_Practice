HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff is on assignment.

00:08.308 --> 00:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour":
Donald Trump
turns again to social media,
unleashing a

00:12.512 --> 00:17.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
storm of tweets, while Hillary
Clinton keeps
up her attacks on the trail.

00:17.551 --> 00:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: in search of a
better life, how
Nigerian women are being conned
by fellow

00:22.256 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Africans to work as prostitutes
on the streets
of Italy.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The problem is,
their clientele
is poor.

00:29.029 --> 00:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The prices are low, which means
that the girls
have to work extra hard to pay
back their

00:33.166 --> 00:34.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debt.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze this week's political
fallout following

00:39.640 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the first presidential debate.

00:41.708 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

HARI SREENIVASAN: The
presidential campaign
erupted with new broadsides
today.

01:00.527 --> 01:04.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump unloaded on a
critic who made
headlines against him this week,
and Hillary

01:04.598 --> 01:09.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton fired back, all of this
with the candidates
about to enter the final full
month before

01:09.469 --> 01:11.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Election Day.

01:11.805 --> 01:17.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's campaign day
began long before
he got to President Gerald
Ford's tomb in

01:17.444 --> 01:19.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

01:19.279 --> 01:23.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Early this morning, he
unleashing a storm
of tweets against Alicia
Machado, a former

01:23.450 --> 01:25.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Miss Universe winner.

01:25.252 --> 01:29.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump had once mocked her weight
gain, and
Clinton raised the issue in
Monday's debate.

01:29.256 --> 01:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Republican nominee
charged Machado
once starred in a sex tape, and
the Clinton

01:33.694 --> 01:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign helped her gain U.S.
citizenship.

01:36.496 --> 01:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That came a day after Trump
raised former
President Bill Clinton's
impeachment scandal.

01:41.568 --> 01:45.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Machado called the charges cheap
lies and
said on Instagram: "The
Republican candidate

01:45.806 --> 01:49.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insists on discrediting and
demoralizing a
woman."

01:49.409 --> 01:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Clinton campaign called the
allegations
unhinged.

01:51.945 --> 01:57.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidate herself had an
answer to Trump's
charges at an afternoon rally in
Coral Springs,

01:57.584 --> 01:59.519 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Florida.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I mean, really, who gets up at
3:00 in the

02:02.856 --> 02:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morning to engage in a Twitter
attack against
a former Miss Universe?

02:08.628 --> 02:12.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, he hurled as many
insults as he could.

02:12.265 --> 02:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have said it before, and I
will say it again:
A man who can be provoked by a
tweet should

02:23.810 --> 02:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not be anywhere near the nuclear
codes.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:27.714 --> 02:30.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, a
Washington
Post report found Trump's
charitable foundation

02:30.684 --> 02:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has never had the required
certification from
the state of New York.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means the group has not
submitted to
annual audits.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the state attorney general
finds the law
was broken, he could go to court
to make the

02:41.561 --> 02:44.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foundation return money it
raised.

02:44.798 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, for the first time
ever, USA Today
rendered judgment on a
presidential race.

02:50.103 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It branded Trump erratic,
ill-equipped to
be commander in chief and a
serial liar, but

02:55.709 --> 02:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
didn't directly endorse Clinton.

02:58.211 --> 03:02.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several traditionally Republican
newspapers
have also come out against Trump
this week.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump campaign is trying to
fight back,
with this new TV ad.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Why
aren't I 50 points
ahead, you might ask.

03:08.555 --> 03:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Maybe it's because the
director
of the FBI said you lied about
your e-mails.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: There
was classified
material e-mailed.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Later today,
he rallied
supporters in Novi, Michigan.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When you cast that ballot, just
picture a

03:21.034 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street boardroom filled
with the special
interests who have bleeding your
country and

03:26.740 --> 03:33.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your city and everyplace else,
and imagine
the look on their faces when you
tell them,

03:33.380 --> 03:34.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you're fired, fired.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:36.516 --> 03:39.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Away from the
charges and
countercharges, Clinton today
unveiled her

03:39.719 --> 03:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new national service reserve
plan in a speech
in Fort Pierce, Florida.

03:43.890 --> 03:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I didn't
want this
campaign to end without talking
about it,

03:48.895 --> 03:51.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because it means a lot to me.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm trying to end the campaign
focusing on
issues that are really close to
my heart,

03:55.669 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and this is one of them.

03:56.937 --> 04:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The end of the
campaign
comes in 39 days.

In the day's other news: A
disciplinary court
in Alabama suspended Chief
Justice Roy Moore

04:06.713 --> 04:08.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over gay marriage.

04:08.682 --> 04:13.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The panel found he encouraged
probate judges
to deny marriage licenses for
same-sex couples.

04:13.153 --> 04:17.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court had said
there is a
fundamental right to marry.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moore is suspended for the
remainder of his
elected term through 2019.

04:20.961 --> 04:24.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After that, he will be too old
to run again,
under state law.

04:24.531 --> 04:28.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Federal investigators in
Hoboken, New Jersey,
have recovered one of the two
black box recorders

04:28.969 --> 04:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from a wrecked commuter train.

04:30.637 --> 04:34.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The train smashed through a
barrier and into
a station waiting area
yesterday.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One person was killed and more
than 100 were
hurt.

04:37.811 --> 04:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recorders should have data
on the train's
speed, braking and other
conditions in the

04:42.582 --> 04:44.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moments before the crash.

The United Nations appealed
today for a new
truce in the Syrian city of
Aleppo.

04:48.722 --> 04:53.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But heavy fighting continued,
and Syrian and
Russian airstrikes blasted more
of the city

04:53.193 --> 04:54.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into ruins.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a report from Alex
Thomson of Independent
Television News.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: In rebel-held East
Aleppo, the
agony continues.

05:00.467 --> 05:09.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It can't be independently
verified, but he
says Russian jets dropped a
thermobaric bomb.

05:10.010 --> 05:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six were killed, six injured,
six missing,
another airstrike in the
besieged east of

05:18.985 --> 05:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the city, desperate to get out
from this.

05:21.721 --> 05:25.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But hands are all the rescuers
have.

05:25.592 --> 05:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Finally, he's out, more or less
intact.

05:31.665 --> 05:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK BRENNAN, World Health
Organization: The
situation really is
unfathomable.

05:39.873 --> 05:45.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to health officials
there, there've
been 338 deaths in the last
couple of weeks

05:45.712 --> 05:50.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
due to the bombardment,
including 106 children.

05:50.317 --> 05:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: South, to the
countryside near
Damascus itself, where people
held a street

05:56.289 --> 06:00.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protest in solidarity with those
in Aleppo,
burning the Russian flag.

06:00.894 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The posters say Putin is a war
criminal.

06:05.165 --> 06:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the grinding violence of
Syria, street
action like this, where the
revolution began,

06:10.937 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks almost quaint six years
on.

06:13.940 --> 06:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The New York
Times reports
Secretary of State John Kerry
voiced frustration

06:18.144 --> 06:23.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the Obama administration's
approach to
Syria speaking on the sidelines

said he advocated for more
military action,

06:27.654 --> 06:29.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but lost that argument.

06:29.623 --> 06:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Philippines, outspoken
President Rodrigo
Duterte drew new criticism today
for comparing

06:34.227 --> 06:38.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
his war on drugs to Adolf
Hitler's extermination
of Jews.

06:38.999 --> 06:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since Duterte took office in
July, more than
3,000 suspected dealers and
users have been

06:43.169 --> 06:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
killed, often vigilante-style.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

beginning.

RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine

there is three million, what is
it, three

06:53.280 --> 06:55.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
million drug addicts.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There are.

06:56.583 --> 07:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would be happy to slaughter
them.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least, if Germany had Hitler,
the Philippines
would have me.

HARI SREENIVASAN: The World
Jewish Congress,

After grocery shopping, hoofing
up stairs
and folding laundry, one says he
finally understands

08:22.001 --> 08:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what his wife put up with.

08:23.870 --> 08:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Japan, women do five times
the housework
that men do.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an iconic
Israeli statesman laid to rest;
the new streamlined

08:31.511 --> 08:36.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
application for student
financial aid; migrants
saved from the Mediterranean
Sea, only to

08:36.583 --> 08:44.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be forced into prostitution; and
much more.

08:44.491 --> 08:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands gathered in Jerusalem
today, as
Israel laid to rest one of its
founding fathers.

08:54.467 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shimon Peres, the 93-year-old
former president
and prime minister, died on
Wednesday.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has our report
on the funeral.

09:02.742 --> 09:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The funeral
service for
Shimon Peres drew delegations
from 75 countries,

09:10.049 --> 09:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and even temporarily united
adversaries.

09:13.319 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas shook
hands with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin

09:17.857 --> 09:24.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Netanyahu and his wife.

09:24.431 --> 09:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The casket was carried in, a
military rabbi
sang traditional prayers, and
Netanyahu spoke

09:30.036 --> 09:32.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in praise of his longtime
political rival.

09:32.839 --> 09:36.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister
(through translator): He brought
arguments

09:36.776 --> 09:37.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the left.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I brought arguments from the
right.

09:39.946 --> 09:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eventually, like two tired
boxers, we stopped
arguing.

09:43.383 --> 09:49.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw in his eyes and I think he
saw in mine
that the determination emanates
from deep

09:49.222 --> 09:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
self-persuasion and devotion to
the cause,
securing the country's future.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Netanyahu has
taken a hard
line on dealing with the
Palestinians, while

09:57.530 --> 10:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Peres was Israel's leading
proponent of conciliation.

10:01.668 --> 10:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the prime minister, speaking
in English,
hailed the Nobel Peace Prize
winner as a visionary.

10:06.072 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: Shimon lived
a life of
purpose.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He soared to incredible heights.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He swept so many with his vision
and his hope.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was a great man of Israel.

10:19.986 --> 10:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was a great man of the world.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Israel grieves for him.

10:24.958 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The world grieves for him.

10:29.596 --> 10:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we find hope in his legacy,
as does the
world.

10:37.203 --> 10:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The failed
search for peace
in the region dominated the
eulogies.

10:41.474 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Bill Clinton
was in office
when Peres negotiated the 1993
Oslo Accords

10:46.713 --> 10:48.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Palestinians.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: He started off life as
Israel's brightest

10:50.783 --> 10:56.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
student, became its best
teacher, and ended
up its biggest dreamer.

10:56.890 --> 11:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for the rest of our lives,
whenever the
good we seek to do hits a stone
wall, or the

11:04.864 --> 11:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hand of friendship we extend
meets only a
cold stare, in his honor, I ask
that we remember

11:15.341 --> 11:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shimon Peres' luminous smile and
imagine.

11:22.282 --> 11:29.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Obama has sought
in vain a final Middle East
settlement between

11:29.756 --> 11:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Israelis and Palestinians.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called for building on the
foundation that
Peres laid.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We gather here in the knowledge
that Shimon

11:38.331 --> 11:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never saw his dream of peace
fulfilled.

11:41.267 --> 11:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The region is going through a
chaotic time.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Threats are ever-present.

11:46.906 --> 11:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet he didn't stop dreaming
and he didn't
stop working.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The last of the founding
generation is now
gone.

11:57.183 --> 12:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shimon accomplished enough
things in life
for 1,000 men, but he understood
that it is

12:02.722 --> 12:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better to live to the very end
of his time
on Earth with a longing not for
the past,

12:08.227 --> 12:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but for the dreams that have not
yet come
true, an Israel that is secure
in a just and

12:14.500 --> 12:16.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lasting peace with its
neighbors.

12:16.536 --> 12:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After the
service, a military
honor guard carried Peres'
casket to its burial

12:21.641 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site, and he was laid to rest
before a crowd
of family, friends and world
leaders.

12:26.946 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

12:30.617 --> 12:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For high
school seniors
around the country and their
families, it's

12:42.895 --> 12:46.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the season to think about
college applications
and costs.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A key to all of it, of course,
is, what kind
of financial aid can they
receive?

12:50.670 --> 12:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's even more crucial for low-
and middle-income
students who may be leaving
thousands of potential

12:55.174 --> 12:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dollars on the table each year.

12:57.810 --> 13:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starting this weekend, there are
important
changes for a student filling
out the Free

13:01.948 --> 13:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Application for Federal Student
Aid, also
known as FAFSA.

13:05.084 --> 13:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For one thing, they will be able
to fill it
out months earlier, in the hopes
of getting

13:08.788 --> 13:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information as they try to
choose a school.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's fill in the picture.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kim Cook is the executive
director of the
National College Access Network,
which works

13:16.062 --> 13:17.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closely on these issues.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, first, what's the
significance of what's
happening this weekend?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM COOK, Executive Director,
National College
Access Network: It's tremendous.

13:21.768 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, over 1.4 million
students left
$2.7 billion in financial aid on
the table

13:28.307 --> 13:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by not completing the Free
Application for
Federal Student Aid.

13:31.611 --> 13:36.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these changes that will make
the form
earlier and easier for students
are significant

13:36.849 --> 13:41.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in helping many of those
low-income students
access the money they need to
attend college.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And one of the
significant
complaints was how complex it
was, how much

13:44.724 --> 13:46.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
information they needed.

13:46.592 --> 13:49.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now apparently there is a
connection between
your previous tax filing that
you can sort

13:49.228 --> 13:51.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of autopopulate online.

13:51.264 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIM COOK: There is, so that's
called the Internal
Revenue Service data retrieval
tool in lingo.

13:56.569 --> 14:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's significant about these
changes that
are coming online tomorrow are
that more students

14:01.174 --> 14:06.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can more easily transfer that
tax information
because it's currently available
tax data.

14:06.946 --> 14:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, we asked students
to transfer
the date that really wasn't
available until

14:12.085 --> 14:13.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tax filing deadlines.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now we're going back another
year to make
it more available and easier for
students

14:16.823 --> 14:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to populate the forms with that
income information
that is sometimes hard to find.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, there is
also that
gap between when you found out
if a school

14:23.896 --> 14:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted you or not and then
another couple
of weeks or months to figure out
what kind

14:28.534 --> 14:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of financial aid you were going
to get from
them.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KIM COOK: Exactly.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, because of the filing times
that used
to be in January, financial aid
offices were

14:36.509 --> 14:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under the gun to get award
applications out
to students, so that they could
make informed

14:40.413 --> 14:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions about what kind of aid
was available
at each particular school, and
where they

14:44.817 --> 14:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could afford and make that
college choice.

14:46.786 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More importantly, on the front
end, there
was a crunch that we asked
students to think

14:51.124 --> 14:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about which colleges they would
apply or go
to before they had any sense of
their aid

14:56.529 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eligibility, never mind what
they will have
now, which is a commitment of
federal student

15:01.167 --> 15:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid on the front end, as early
as October
now, as they go into their
college search

15:05.505 --> 15:07.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and application time.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this was
part of the
general disincentive over kind
of the burdens

15:10.576 --> 15:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of trying to get in, I don't
know how much
money I'm going to get, I don't
who is going

15:13.579 --> 15:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to accept me, and kind of one
competing with
the other.

15:17.083 --> 15:17.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KIM COOK: Right.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

15:20.052 --> 15:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now we're giving students an
early commitment
of at least their federal aid,
so a low-income

15:24.490 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
student who receives a Pell
Grant and subsidized
loans could have up to $11,500
of a commitment

15:31.430 --> 15:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they look around and, A, make
the important
decision that college is
affordable and something

15:35.768 --> 15:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for me, and, B, where to go,
that I have a
commitment of money in my pocket
to make this

15:41.107 --> 15:42.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
possible.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what
happens if the
colleges just decide to move all
of their

15:44.944 --> 15:46.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deadlines up?

15:46.746 --> 15:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been some concern,
especially for
low- and middle-income
households, that a

15:49.348 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deadline creep actually adds a
lot of pressure
and decreases the amount of
completed applications.

15:53.152 --> 15:57.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KIM COOK: We're watching
carefully in this
first year, because that is a
concern, that

15:57.790 --> 16:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students could have a real
crunch to push
what used to be a longer process
and truncate

16:02.228 --> 16:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that process of admissions and
financial aid
into the same three months.

16:06.766 --> 16:12.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The good news is, regardless of
how that does
play out this year, the May 1
commitment date

16:12.505 --> 16:14.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
holds steady.

16:14.473 --> 16:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, students could have that
information earlier,
but they can't be pressured to
commit to an

16:19.178 --> 16:21.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aid package before May 1.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you said
in the beginning,
but it's kind of staggering to
think about

16:24.116 --> 16:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$2 billion left on the table.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many students start this
process and don't
finish?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM COOK: We're still trying to
get some of
that data.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we know how many
students don't
complete.

16:33.826 --> 16:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, 45 -- only 45 percent of
high school seniors
complete a FAFSA by their high
school graduation.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some continue to complete it
after high school
graduation as well.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's still a staggering
number, when
you consider that the FAFSA is
the ultimate

16:46.505 --> 16:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predictor of whether a student
will go on
to enroll in college, with 90
percent of those

16:51.310 --> 16:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
completing a FAFSA enrolling in
college.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's also
interesting
that there are multiple things.

16:56.949 --> 17:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just family income that
figures out
what kind of aid you get.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KIM COOK: Right.

17:04.290 --> 17:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, income obviously plays a
significant role,
but the number in college,
whether your family

17:08.694 --> 17:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
qualifies for other federal
means-tested benefits,
where you go to college, so,
many, many factors

17:14.967 --> 17:16.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
factor in.

17:16.836 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key message that we want to
get across
and is part of a national FAFSA
completion

17:20.273 --> 17:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign that NCAN is kicking
off called Form
Your Future, is that this is
your first step

17:24.844 --> 17:26.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to going to college.

17:26.612 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All students should complete the
FAFSA and
get the money for which they're
eligible.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And even
whether the type
of household that you're in,
what kind of

17:34.053 --> 17:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
siblings, if you have other
siblings in school,
are all factors.

17:36.923 --> 17:37.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KIM COOK: Exactly.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

17:39.525 --> 17:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number in household, number in
college, all
of those factors come into play.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we don't want any students
to rule themselves
out.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want all students to complete
that FAFSA
to get that money that has been
left on the

17:47.333 --> 17:48.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
table.

17:48.534 --> 17:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Kim
Cook, thanks
so much.

17:54.607 --> 18:00.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KIM COOK: Thank you.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

18:04.650 --> 18:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
foreign hackers
target voter registration
systems; and Mark

18:09.455 --> 18:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and David Brooks, their
take on the
week's political news.

18:13.492 --> 18:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: the harrowing story
of Nigerian
women fleeing to Europe for a
better life,

18:18.931 --> 18:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but finding themselves trapped
into a life
of prostitution.

18:22.001 --> 18:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest figures from the
International
Organization for Migration
estimate that 80

18:26.072 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of all Nigerian women
that make it
across the Mediterranean to
Italy are forced

18:31.310 --> 18:33.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the sex trade.

18:33.346 --> 18:39.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At its heart are female
traffickers who enslave
women to extort tens of
thousands of dollars.

18:39.185 --> 18:42.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Italy, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

18:42.221 --> 18:48.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Asti in
Northern Italy prides
itself as the capital of the
country's sparkling

18:48.861 --> 18:50.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wine industry.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's another side to this
city.

18:51.897 --> 18:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's home to African women
rescued after being
trafficked as prostitutes.

18:56.902 --> 19:02.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Like so many compatriots,
26-year-old Blessing
Ighodaro was seeking a better
life in Europe.

19:02.341 --> 19:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mother of three arrived in
Italy from
Nigeria in June after being
deceived.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BLESSING IGHODARO, Italy: The
story I was
told in Nigeria before I come to
this place,

19:10.249 --> 19:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that if I come to this place, I
can have a
job of cleaning.

19:14.920 --> 19:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Italian women, I can help them
to be cleaning
the house, taking care of their
children.

19:20.726 --> 19:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After a hellish
journey to
Libya across the Sahara Desert,
Blessing was

19:24.930 --> 19:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put in a rubber dinghy and
almost drowned
in similar circumstances to the
21 women who

19:30.169 --> 19:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
died in this boat in July.

19:32.038 --> 19:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BLESSING IGHODARO: When the
water is here,
when I stand up, I was -- the
water is in

19:36.642 --> 19:38.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my place here.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oh, God, my children, my family,
I don't want
to lose my life like this.

19:40.913 --> 19:41.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's like that.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was frightened.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was ton of water on my
body, water on
my face, pressing me down.

19:46.318 --> 19:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was the first person which
they rescued
after the children, because I'm
already unconscious.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have any strength,
nothing, nothing.

19:52.658 --> 19:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These images
are of the aftermath
of the July disaster, in which
21 African

19:57.730 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women died.

19:59.799 --> 20:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the latest statistics are
applied, at least
16 of the victims were facing a
life of prostitution

20:05.137 --> 20:06.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on European streets.

20:07.039 --> 20:12.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In death, they were spared in
one respect,
spared the pressure faced by
Blessing as the

20:12.378 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nigerian trafficker, or madam,
tried to extort
the 35,000 euros or nearly
$40,000 she claimed

20:20.119 --> 20:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was owing for the journey to
Europe.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BLESSING IGHODARO: I should put
on some sexy
clothes.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I go out there, look for money.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know you have to.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You have family.

20:30.362 --> 20:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need to pay me my bill,
which you take
an oath for.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And let me warn you.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Never you tell anyone that this
madam brought
you here.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is the oath I take.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a night, which normally
I sleep.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I say, God, what am I going to
do?

20:45.878 --> 20:46.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't even feed myself.

20:46.979 --> 20:47.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

20:48.981 --> 20:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't even know where to go.

20:49.982 --> 20:50.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where will I stay ?

20:50.983 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I decided to put on my sexy
clothes.

20:51.984 --> 20:52.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I go out there.

20:53.052 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The first day, I have 120 euro.

20:57.389 --> 21:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was very -- say, 120 euro,
is that how
I'm going to pay 35,000 euro?

21:02.495 --> 21:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Blessing
heard about
a program in Asti to help sex
trafficking

21:06.966 --> 21:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victims break free from the
madam.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She abandoned the streets,
despite the intimidation.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BLESSING IGHODARO: If I didn't
pay her the
money, that is where she's going
to hurt my

21:14.907 --> 21:16.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I can't pay her the
money, she has
no business with my family.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But you haven't
paid her
the money, have you?

21:20.579 --> 21:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BLESSING IGHODARO: No, no, no,
no.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I won't pay.

21:23.382 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
MALCOLM BRABANT:
Eighteen-year-old Cynthia
tells a similar story of false
promises and

21:27.319 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being forced into prostitution.

21:29.188 --> 21:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like Blessing, she broke with
help from Princess
Inyang Okokon.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Princess was rescued from the
sex trade, and
is now dedicated to thwarting
the madams.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PRINCESS INYANG OKOKON,
Activist: At Turin,
they sold me to one madam.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She bought me.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was the first girl of this
woman.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she was a young woman like
me.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I got there, I realized
that it was prostitution.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I need to do.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't do the job.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They took me to the place of
work.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I waited almost a week.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I couldn't do it.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was crying, telling God, is
this the job
you sent me to come and do?

22:00.853 --> 22:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CYNTHIA, Italy: They took me to
street junction.

22:06.625 --> 22:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is where I would be doing
road work.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was not what she told
me that I would
be doing.

22:13.365 --> 22:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said that that is the work
that she is
doing here, that that is work I
have to do.

22:17.870 --> 22:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was like threatening me that
I'm not out
on there streets, I should also
be thinking

22:21.674 --> 22:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about my family at home, that
she would harm
them.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She would do all sorts of
things.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said, no, that I cannot do it.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She said OK.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since I'm a very stubborn girl,
she knows
what she will do to me.

22:31.984 --> 22:37.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The victims of
this potentially
deadly trade are usually naive,
ill-educated,

22:37.723 --> 22:39.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or poor.

22:39.425 --> 22:43.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The trafficking networks
especially prey on
women from the African
countryside.

22:43.596 --> 22:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRINCESS INYANG OKOKON: They are
operators,
like young boys, goes into the
rural areas,

22:48.867 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes into the families that
knows maybe their
parents are sick, goes into the
families that

22:56.041 --> 23:03.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lack money to train their
children, and goes
into the areas that they have
people that

23:03.182 --> 23:05.017 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are weak.

23:05.117 --> 23:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Although four
out of every
five women rescued in the
Western Mediterranean

23:08.254 --> 23:14.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
end up in the sex trade,
Princess believes
the Italian mafia is not guilty
in this case.

23:14.460 --> 23:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PRINCESS INYANG OKOKON:
Nigerians, Ghanaians
are involved, but Italian mafia
are not really

23:21.433 --> 23:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involved in this prostitution
criminal event.

23:24.370 --> 23:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Although their
prime intention
is saving lives, the reality for
organizations

23:29.742 --> 23:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rescuing migrants from drowning
is that they
have inadvertently become a key
link in the

23:34.546 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transport chain supplying
prostitutes to Europe.

23:39.184 --> 23:44.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to Princess, the women
are terrorized
into compliance by black magic
or juju.

23:44.290 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PRINCESS INYANG OKOKON: These
rituals is normally
done by the juju masters in
Nigeria.

23:50.929 --> 23:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They use some things like the
heart of some
animals to make these rituals.

23:55.601 --> 24:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Being that the women are poor,
from poor family,
they will entice to threaten
them, tell them

24:03.108 --> 24:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swear an oath that if you arrive
and you don't
pay me, the oath will kill you
or your family

24:08.347 --> 24:10.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or your sisters or your
brothers, your children.

24:10.783 --> 24:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: One of the most
significant
factors about the ever expanding
migrant crisis

24:15.220 --> 24:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the disproportionately large
number of
single young men making the
crossing to Europe.

24:20.726 --> 24:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, these Nigerian madams, have
unwittingly,
or on purpose, found that this
is a group

24:26.665 --> 24:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's going to make them a lot
of money,
because all of the rescued girls
that we have

24:30.736 --> 24:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoken to have indicated that
the majority
of their clients are African or
from countries

24:36.909 --> 24:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where Arabic is spoken, like
Morocco, and
there are very few Italians.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is their clientele
is poor, the
prices are low, which means that
the girls

24:45.584 --> 24:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to work extra hard to pay
back their
debt.

24:50.522 --> 24:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To hear a different perspective
from provincial
Asti, we have come to prosperous
Milan, a

24:55.127 --> 24:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
magnet for African migrants,
where Europe's
reality kicks in.

24:59.932 --> 25:04.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people find themselves
living in the
open here because neighboring
countries like

25:04.370 --> 25:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
France, Switzerland and Austria
have tightened
up their border controls.

Fabio Di Giacomo works for the
International
Organization for Migration.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FABIO DI GIACOMO, International
Organization
for Migration: The request for
these girls

25:14.480 --> 25:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes not from migrants, but
from local people
in Italy and in Europe.

25:20.018 --> 25:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These girls used to arrive to
Italy and to
work in Italy as prostitutes,
but, as a matter

25:24.490 --> 25:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of fact, we have noticed in the
past few months
that some of these women are
actually continuing

25:30.596 --> 25:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
their journey to France,
Austria, Spain, and
Germany.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is modern slavery.

25:36.301 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These girls are forced to face
terrible abuses
and violence in the countries of
origin, in

25:43.308 --> 25:45.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the country of transit.

25:45.177 --> 25:49.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they don't even know the
kind of abuse
they are going to be forced to
face here in

25:50.048 --> 25:51.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that should be
tackled as soon
as possible.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a modern plague.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And the
perpetrators aren't
concerned about the age of their
victims.

25:58.490 --> 26:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The girl is 14 years, but
she told
us she's 17.

26:02.494 --> 26:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know the way she speak, you
know that
she is a baby.

26:05.798 --> 26:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the madam brought her to walk
in the streets,
and luckily enough, she gets in
touch with

26:11.603 --> 26:13.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us and we save her.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Onome Efanadju
is 17 years
old.

26:16.775 --> 26:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She came to Italy last year and
worked as
a prostitute for two months
before being rescued.

26:22.314 --> 26:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's now a catering trainee at
an Italian
company offering dozens of women
skills to

26:28.020 --> 26:29.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pursue a better life.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ONOME EFANADJU, Italy: You girls
in Nigeria,
in case someone wants to take
you, there's

26:32.691 --> 26:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no good job in -- there's no
work in Europe.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are only deceiving us to
come to Europe.

26:38.430 --> 26:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All they do is to bring you here
and to sell
your body, so you better think
twice before

26:45.637 --> 26:47.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you come to Europe.

26:47.806 --> 26:52.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This shows the
psychological
pressure to which the women are
subjected.

26:52.744 --> 26:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After ignoring repeated messages
from the
Nigerian madam who trafficked
her, Blessing

26:58.150 --> 26:59.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answers her phone.

26:59.985 --> 27:04.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: This woman is now angry
that she got
a good life here and she forgot
the debts

27:04.823 --> 27:08.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she's supposed to go and
work in the
streets and pay her debt.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I feel bad.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What am I am doing to myself?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is this?

27:14.833 --> 27:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will be crying, sometimes, two
days, three
days.

27:16.602 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can't eat.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't do anything else.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she will be calling me to
bring money.

27:21.106 --> 27:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"You don't want to pay me.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will be waiting for your
money.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will be doing this."

27:25.377 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she will be calling me for
money.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My body is shaking.

27:29.715 --> 27:30.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm worried.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The personal
tragedies are
never-ending.

27:32.885 --> 27:38.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Gloria, a 32-year-old
hairdresser, was lured
to Europe under false pretenses,
and as a

27:38.991 --> 27:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
result, has lost touch with her
three young
children.

27:41.927 --> 27:45.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GLORIA Italy: Three years, and I
have never
seen them.

27:45.564 --> 27:46.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's nothing I can do.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't disappear there.

27:47.566 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm not a witch.

27:48.567 --> 27:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have to see my children.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have anybody to help me.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I had the choice, I would go
for me to
see my children.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The trade
appears to be self-perpetuating.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Many of the madams are
themselves former victims
of trafficking.

28:01.747 --> 28:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRINCESS INYANG OKOKON: They
know the horrible
things they met in the street.

28:07.886 --> 28:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means they purposely take
another human
to face the same calamity they
faced.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is my anger.

28:13.692 --> 28:19.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you were a slave, don't put
another person
to be a slave after you.

28:19.131 --> 28:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Unfortunately
for Northern
Italy's street walkers,
Princess' rescue organization

28:24.636 --> 28:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is running out of money and has
failed to
secure future funding.

28:28.340 --> 28:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the chances of escaping are
reduced, and
thousands more women are
expected.

28:32.911 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Asti, Northern Italy.

28:54.766 --> 28:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since revelations in June that
the Democratic
National Committee and
Democratic Congressional

28:58.437 --> 29:00.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Committee's data had been
stolen.

29:00.639 --> 29:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence official
pointed the finger
at Russian-government-linked
hackers, though

29:05.344 --> 29:07.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wouldn't say so publicly.

29:07.346 --> 29:11.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Separately, Illinois and
Arizona's voter registration
databases were penetrated in
June, forcing

29:11.984 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to temporarily shut down.

29:14.486 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, FBI Director James
Comey told Congress
there had been new attempts to
penetrate many

29:19.891 --> 29:22.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more state voter databases.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret Warner has been looking
into this
and joins me now.

29:24.630 --> 29:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's the real danger to
the elections
if voter registration databases
are being

29:29.534 --> 29:30.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hacked?

29:31.036 --> 29:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Hari, on one
hand, it could
be strictly criminal.

29:32.971 --> 29:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People want to get addresses,
home phone numbers,
e-mails, and use it for criminal
purposes.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many states have had to deal
with that
in the past.

29:40.779 --> 29:46.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other danger is that
that information
can be used to selectively used
to manipulate

29:46.818 --> 29:48.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the vote on Election Day.

29:48.687 --> 29:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, send out e-mails to
voters in
certain districts, perhaps
minority districts,

29:54.893 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, oh, your registration place
has been
changed, your voting place has
been changed.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this has been done often by
phone.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an old, old trick.

30:04.770 --> 30:08.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or to simply to delete them from
the database,
so when they get there, there is
incredible

30:08.173 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
confusion.

30:10.008 --> 30:13.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, as a senior homeland
security official
told me this afternoon, the
other danger that

30:13.812 --> 30:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really worries us is that just
the news of
these hacks undermined American
voters' view

30:22.020 --> 30:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the credibility of the U.S.
election system.

30:23.955 --> 30:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are certainly foreign
powers who
would like to do that.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, let's talk
about those
foreign powers.

30:28.093 --> 30:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do the U.S. officials believe
that the Russians
are behind this or any of the
other hacks

30:32.631 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that have been related so far?

30:34.266 --> 30:36.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, they established
that they were
behind the hacks you mentioned
earlier, the

30:38.970 --> 30:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DNC and the DCCC, and that there
are two sort
of outfits, what is called Fancy
Bear -- it's

30:44.543 --> 30:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a nickname -- and one is Cozy
Bear.

30:46.445 --> 30:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is linked to the old KGB
called the GRU
and one is linked to military
intelligence.

30:52.684 --> 30:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was told by cyber-experts
who have been
involved in these investigations
that these

30:57.589 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voter database hacks are the
work of so-called
Fancy Bear, which is the one
side to Russian

31:04.596 --> 31:06.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military intelligence.

31:06.431 --> 31:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the same outfit that, in
Ukraine,
in Ukrainian elections two years
ago, penetrated

31:12.337 --> 31:20.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the database of the Ukrainian
election authorities
and tried to switch the actual
plate that

31:20.278 --> 31:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
showed who was winning where.

31:22.514 --> 31:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't succeed, but the
fake plate that
showed someone else won did end
up on Russian

31:27.352 --> 31:28.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TV in Russia.

31:28.653 --> 31:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's almost
like a Dewey
wins sign.

31:30.088 --> 31:31.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes, exactly.

31:32.023 --> 31:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Homeland
Security, Jeh Johnson
said this morning that by design
almost, or

31:35.527 --> 31:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least by reality, 9,000
different precincts
that we have, they don't all use
the same

31:39.965 --> 31:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, don't have the same
databases, so
there is not a direct threat in
manipulating

31:44.269 --> 31:45.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the overall result.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: He's actually
right about
that.

31:47.572 --> 31:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a crazy system and, as he
said, 9,000
different precincts.

31:52.077 --> 31:57.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there is an Internet
connection at some
point, when most of them report
to the central

31:57.282 --> 31:58.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commission.

31:58.283 --> 32:00.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that can always be checked
back.

32:00.185 --> 32:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other vulnerability, though,
is some states
still use voter touch-screen
machines that

32:05.690 --> 32:07.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leave no paper audit trail.

32:07.692 --> 32:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So,, like in swing state like
Pennsylvania,
which this is true, in
Philadelphia, there

32:11.496 --> 32:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is no paper trail, whereas, in
Bucks County,
there is.

32:15.400 --> 32:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if someone who were really
smart, picked
swing districts in swing states
and put malware

32:21.439 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the computer, you know, the
voting machines,
to go off that day and change
every third

32:27.379 --> 32:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton vote for Trump or vice
versa, it would
be impossible to go back later
and check.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's the
government doing
about this, considering we're 39
days away?

32:35.887 --> 32:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, not as
much as many
cyber-security experts would
like.

32:40.559 --> 32:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Jeh Johnson, the secretary
of homeland
security, did do right after --
right in midsummer,

32:46.064 --> 32:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was call all the secretaries of
state, had
a big conference call, and say,
look, there

32:49.201 --> 32:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a big danger out there.

32:51.102 --> 32:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, we want you to -- and we're
ready to
help.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He sent out a lot of new
standards.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said you have to be sure to
close all your
open doors.

32:58.844 --> 33:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of these precincts just
don't have the
manpower or the money to do it
right.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will give you technical
help.

33:04.549 --> 33:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was told this afternoon that
18 to 20 of
the states have actually asked
for and received

33:10.655 --> 33:19.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nightly what's called
cyber-election screening,
where they basically run through
the system

33:19.564 --> 33:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then they alert, the federal
government
does, Homeland Security does,
and then says

33:23.068 --> 33:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Iowa, you know, by the way,
we discovered
something funny, you need to
patch this.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, that doesn't fix the
election machines
themselves.

33:32.077 --> 33:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what they didn't do, the
federal government
chose not to do is declare a
part of critical

33:36.915 --> 33:38.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infrastructure.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That would have given the
federal government
the ability to go really in and
set up standards

33:41.953 --> 33:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also send a message to
Russia that this
is really a no-no and this is
considered grounds

33:47.058 --> 33:48.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for retaliation.

33:48.426 --> 33:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Margaret Warner,
thanks so much.

33:53.665 --> 33:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: My pleasure,
Hari.

33:59.771 --> 34:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that
brings us to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

34:07.612 --> 34:08.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, here we are.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Monday night, you were here
after the debates.

34:11.816 --> 34:17.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now my first question isn't
about a significant
policy discrepancy.

34:17.422 --> 34:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The entire news cycle has been
concerned with
whether or not he paid taxes and
also how

34:22.260 --> 34:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is treating a beauty queen,
or how he treated
her and how he is still treating
her.

34:26.197 --> 34:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You're right,
although I don't
think they're bookends.

34:29.868 --> 34:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think they're of equal
value or significance.

34:33.838 --> 34:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that his disdain for
paying taxes
and his self-identification as a
smart person

34:41.813 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for not doing so reveals any
absence, a total
absence of civic-mindedness,
citizen responsibility.

34:51.022 --> 34:57.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, the idea of John
Kennedy's ask not
what you can do for your country
-- ask not

34:57.529 --> 35:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what your country can do you
for, but what
you can do for your country, is
just so alien

35:01.866 --> 35:02.867 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

35:02.968 --> 35:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the attack on Alicia Machado
fits a pattern.

35:09.441 --> 35:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a man who, as
Tony Schwartz,
who wrote "The Art of the Deal,"
the ghost

35:16.114 --> 35:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writer of it, and made Trump
really a central
figure in America with that
book, wrote -- he

35:24.289 --> 35:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, every time he's criticized
or caught
for any of his lies, he doubles
down

35:30.895 --> 35:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's exactly what he does.

35:32.764 --> 35:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And usually in the pattern with
Mr. and Mrs.
Khan, the Gold Star parents, and
with Judge

35:39.404 --> 35:45.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Curiel, is to pick on someone
who doesn't
have the resources, the stature,
the voice

35:45.643 --> 35:47.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he does, and try to
overwhelm them.

35:47.912 --> 35:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, we're
working on
a story for Sunday on kind of
the impact on

35:52.117 --> 35:54.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Latino vote in Florida, for
example.

35:54.119 --> 36:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we even saw, since the
debate, increase
in search registration, searches
in predominantly

36:00.158 --> 36:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Latino areas, according to
Google.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this going to matter, the
fact that he
has called this Miss
Housekeeping?

36:04.729 --> 36:05.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did that resonate?

36:05.730 --> 36:06.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Did that connect?

36:06.731 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: If the vote can go
any lower.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It might affect turnout
potentially.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But his support in the Latino
community wasn't
super high.

36:13.938 --> 36:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his support isn't super
high.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it may go lower.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But maybe it can't.

36:19.844 --> 36:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to me, the crucial fact of
this story
-- well, first, we should just
step back and

36:24.983 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be aware of its bizarreness,
that we are a
month away from electing a
president and one

36:29.854 --> 36:32.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our candidates is up in the
middle of the
night tweeting about an alleged
sex tape.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: A 70-year-old
grandfather.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's just another day in
paradise as far as
this election goes.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we should just continue
to remind ourselves
of that bizarreness.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, to me, the significance of
the tweets
in the morning or in the middle
of the night

36:47.038 --> 36:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were the solitariness of the
guy.

36:50.175 --> 36:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, most campaigns, they're a
campaign.

36:51.643 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a team.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
An administration is a team.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a front person and
an ultimate
insider, but it's a team effort,
and decisions

36:57.849 --> 37:01.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are made and strategies are
discussed and
decisions.

37:01.686 --> 37:07.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's alone in the middle of
the night
upending his whole campaign with
this, I don't,

37:07.258 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
impulse-driven tweetstorm.

37:09.627 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that to me is the most
unnerving part
of the whole thing, let alone
the low-class

37:12.630 --> 37:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nature of the thing, is that
he's unorganizationable.

37:17.802 --> 37:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just -- it's been his
secret of his
success, but it's hard to
imagine a president

37:22.006 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acting that way.

37:23.341 --> 37:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Could I just add
one thing to
what David said?

37:25.944 --> 37:28.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I agree with the point he
made.

37:28.680 --> 37:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The discussion on the debate on
Iraq, all
right, 2.8 million Americans
have served in

37:38.356 --> 37:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uniform many multiple tours in
Iraq and Afghanistan
over the last 15 years; 6,890
have died, been

37:48.333 --> 37:49.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
killed.

37:49.734 --> 37:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as Donald Trump discussed
that war, it
was all about him.

37:53.972 --> 38:00.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was about his alleged
discussions, his
discredited argument that, in
2002, as a real

38:01.045 --> 38:08.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estate mogul in New York, in
private, off-the-air
conversations with Sean Hannity,
he had opposed

38:08.753 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the war.

38:10.622 --> 38:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out the war wasn't
about the United
States or those who fought it or
those people

38:15.360 --> 38:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there in that area who suffered
through it.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about Donald Trump.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it comes back to that.

38:21.900 --> 38:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is -- a really successful
presidential
campaign is always about the
voters.

38:27.572 --> 38:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about their hopes, their
lives, their
futures, their country.

38:31.075 --> 38:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the only chance you
have to lead
a country if you do win.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is all about him.

38:36.281 --> 38:41.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clinton's
campaigning today
in Florida, a large Cuban
American community.

38:41.352 --> 38:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And earlier this week, there was
a story led
by "Newsweek" and other outlets
also talked

38:45.256 --> 38:49.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how Donald Trump had
business interests
that were trying to do business
in Cuba.

38:49.761 --> 38:53.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was during a time when
there were
economic sanctions, and this
might be a violation

38:53.264 --> 38:54.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of those rules.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does that matter to that
community there?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the short answer is, I
don't know.

38:59.604 --> 39:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second answer is that the
Cuban issue,
I think, has been dissolved by
what's happened

39:05.977 --> 39:07.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the last four years.

39:07.912 --> 39:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it hasn't particularly hurt
Barack Obama
in Florida to take the position
he's taken.

39:13.251 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it may hurt him on some,
but I have
trouble believing that anybody
not -- the

39:16.888 --> 39:20.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cuban American population that
is super Republican
was already pretty super
Republican.

39:20.592 --> 39:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, the violation of U.S. law
with the
Cuba thing is symptomatic of one
thing about

39:25.997 --> 39:27.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm a big fan of capitalism,
but capitalism
unrestrained by any moral system
and any sense

39:31.369 --> 39:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of moral restraint, that you're
just about
money and you're just about
selfishness, is

39:36.641 --> 39:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very destructive and corrosive
thing.

39:39.043 --> 39:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so whether it's bragging
about not paying
taxes or just trying to make
money any way

39:43.581 --> 39:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can regardless of the law or
regardless
decency, or stiffing your
contractors, that's

39:48.720 --> 39:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of -- we the devolution of
what capitalism
can become when the human beings
who do it

39:53.992 --> 39:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have some other moral
system to go to,
to sort of check selfishness.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what we see.

39:59.731 --> 40:03.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hillary
Clinton is working
hard to try to win millennial
voters back

40:03.334 --> 40:06.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from third-party candidates.

40:06.704 --> 40:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You think that perhaps the
Libertarian candidate
would have pulled more from
Donald Trump than

40:11.542 --> 40:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from her, but why is she not
connecting?

40:14.312 --> 40:16.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: She's never
connected.

40:17.048 --> 40:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders cleaned her clock
among younger
voters.

40:21.619 --> 40:27.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is not the sense of either
rebellion
or inspiration or vision.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you can check off all
the boxes.

40:30.628 --> 40:31.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's good on the issues.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's good on student loans and
so forth.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's an important segment.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this was a key segment
to -- element.

40:38.336 --> 40:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They represented one out of five
voters, voters
between the ages of 18 and 29,
in 2012 for

40:43.608 --> 40:45.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Barack Obama.

40:45.443 --> 40:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They represented more votes
really in actual
terms than did voters over the
age of 65.

40:49.647 --> 40:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they didn't turn out in
2014, and the
Democrats got murdered in the
off-year.

40:54.352 --> 40:59.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the over-65 represented 9
percent more
than did the 18-to-29-year-olds.

40:59.957 --> 41:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's not a question simply
of reaching
them and converting them.

41:05.596 --> 41:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's energizing them and getting
them to the
polls.

41:09.300 --> 41:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I may just add, Gary Johnson,
who got the
endorsement this week of The
Chicago Tribune

41:14.605 --> 41:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and The Detroit News, I mean,
when he couldn't
name a single -- he couldn't
name the Dalai

41:19.277 --> 41:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lama or Pope Francis or Justin
Trudeau or
anybody that he liked or admired
as a foreign

41:25.917 --> 41:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader, may well have hurt the
case for normalization
of marijuana.

41:29.887 --> 41:31.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:31.756 --> 41:36.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He just -- I think
he hurt himself
as a candidate -- I really do --
with this

41:36.394 --> 41:38.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
group and anybody else.

41:38.296 --> 41:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, how
much of this
is the fact that the first-time
voters perhaps

41:41.833 --> 41:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't remember the impact that a
third candidate
or a party can have?

41:46.404 --> 41:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the year 2000, these folks
were maybe in
elementary school.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It would be
interesting, if
the polls are super tight at the
end, whether

41:53.911 --> 41:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Johnson would begin to fade.

41:54.912 --> 41:56.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I suspect that he probably
would.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she just doesn't speak the
language of
millennials, not that Trump
does, and he's

42:00.651 --> 42:01.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even worse.

42:02.053 --> 42:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one thing young people have
a lot of,
it's future.

42:06.224 --> 42:10.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they want to feel some sense
of lift and
idealism about the future.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they want to be called.

42:11.996 --> 42:15.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just saying, oh, I will give
you free
college, without any sense of
lift, without

42:15.133 --> 42:20.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any sense of transformation of
society, which
Sanders did offer, then it's
just not speaking

42:20.338 --> 42:25.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the language of hope and
inspiration, idealism,
which hopefully people of all
ages respond

42:25.877 --> 42:27.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's the part of a
campaign that's been
lacking for her.

42:29.213 --> 42:33.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You mentioned
the endorsements
from The Chicago Tribune, but
the USA Today

42:33.618 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
took an unusual step.

42:35.853 --> 42:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lots of papers are taking their
steps.

42:37.588 --> 42:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're making their case for
one candidate
or another.

42:40.925 --> 42:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do these endorsements matter,
considering
how upside-down world this cycle
seems to

42:45.930 --> 42:47.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be?

42:47.532 --> 42:49.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Or are we just saying my
Facebook feed says
this, this is what I should do?

42:49.934 --> 42:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: As an alumnus of
editorial writing,
of course they do.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everybody sits on the edge of
their seat.

42:56.307 --> 43:00.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure that people are
saying, well,
I want to see what The Arizona
Republic said.

43:00.812 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you get papers like The
Arizona Republic,
which, in its history, has never
endorsed

43:05.116 --> 43:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Democrat, The Dallas Morning
News, the last
Democrat endorsed was Franklin
Roosevelt in

43:09.921 --> 43:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1940, the Cincinnati Enquirer
was Woodrow
Wilson 1916 -- and I read it at
the time.

43:16.060 --> 43:17.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:17.895 --> 43:20.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it has a
cumulative
effect, because the theme that
runs through

43:20.731 --> 43:25.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them is not an embrace of
Hillary Clinton
and the Democratic platform.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a rejection.

43:27.839 --> 43:32.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's going on the record
in just categorical
terms that he's unacceptable as
a presidential

43:32.577 --> 43:33.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

43:33.578 --> 43:35.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

43:35.179 --> 43:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say signed columns have
a big impact,
but unsigned editorials...

43:36.614 --> 43:37.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:37.615 --> 43:39.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:39.150 --> 43:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, let
me squeeze
in one non-election-related.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This week, we saw a very strange
thing from
Congress.

43:44.922 --> 43:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the first veto of
President Obama's
first entire eight years, and it
was about

43:50.795 --> 43:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether or not families should
be able to
sue Saudi Arabia, 9/11 families,
and then

43:56.834 --> 43:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was overridden by Congress.

43:59.337 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, the day after that, we
get people
getting up to that podium
saying, well, we

44:05.376 --> 44:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to kind of look at this
again.

44:06.811 --> 44:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I have been a
defender of Congress
for a long time.

44:10.314 --> 44:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after they took off seven
weeks and come
back here to pick up clean
shirts and their

44:15.219 --> 44:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
checks, and now, before taking
six weeks off,
they vote on this, and by 99-1.

44:21.092 --> 44:24.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next day, Mitch McConnell
says, the president
made me do it.

44:24.896 --> 44:28.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, these are unintended
ramifications.

44:28.900 --> 44:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really -- he should have been
stronger,
like we're puppets of the
president.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just in that sense, it was an
incredible scene
to watch.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David?

44:39.176 --> 44:40.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:40.745 --> 44:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Substantively, I
do side with
the administration on this.

44:42.680 --> 44:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just can't have a foreign
policy where
every individual gets to sue a
foreign government

44:46.150 --> 44:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and run our own foreign policy
through the
court system.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so Obama is right on the
merits.

44:49.921 --> 44:52.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's tough to vote against the
9/11 families.

44:52.156 --> 44:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the president didn't make
them sign a
bill that he opposed.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I agree with Mark on that
one.

44:57.562 --> 45:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Brooks,
Mark Shields, thanks so much.

45:02.033 --> 45:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the vice presidential
debate on Tuesday
and two more presidential
debates to come,

45:06.070 --> 45:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
check out watchthedebates.org,
where you can
interact wither every
presidential debate

45:10.408 --> 45:35.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 1960.

45:35.499 --> 45:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the latest addition to the
"NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

45:37.568 --> 45:43.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a closer look at the roots
of the Islamic
State in the wake of 9/11 and
the people affected

45:43.240 --> 45:46.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by its spread in an unstable
Middle East.

45:46.243 --> 45:47.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lawrence Wright
first went
to the Middle East as a young
man to teach

45:51.449 --> 45:53.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
English in Cairo.

45:53.317 --> 45:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the beginning of a long
relationship
with the region that would
coincide with the

45:56.487 --> 46:00.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rise of terrorism and American
wars that continue
to this day.

46:00.424 --> 46:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His 2006 book, "The Looming
Tower," on the
growth of al-Qaida and events
leading to 9/11,

46:06.397 --> 46:08.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
won the Pulitzer Prize.

46:08.199 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now he's pulled together
writings from "The
New Yorker" magazine, the
product of many

46:11.469 --> 46:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years of reporting, in a new
book titled "The
Terror Years: From Al-Qaeda to
the Islamic

46:17.341 --> 46:18.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
State."

46:18.342 --> 46:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Larry Wright, welcome back
to you.

46:20.244 --> 46:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT, Author, "The
Terror Years:
From Al-Qaeda to the Islamic
State": Thank

46:20.678 --> 46:21.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, Jeff.

46:21.345 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good to be with you.

46:23.214 --> 46:24.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fifteen years
after 9/11, I
suppose there is a sense of
wanting to tie

46:24.982 --> 46:26.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things together.

46:26.684 --> 46:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you see a guiding thread in
your work
when you went back to look at
it?

46:30.421 --> 46:32.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes.

46:32.390 --> 46:35.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was planning just to put
together a collection
of articles, but then when I
looked at all

46:35.860 --> 46:41.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the work that I had done on
terrorism since
9/11, I never thought that I
would still be

46:41.399 --> 46:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
writing about that 15 years
later.

46:44.335 --> 46:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I realized these pieces told
-- had a
kind of narrative quality in
terms of the

46:48.706 --> 46:54.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evolution of ISIS and al-Qaida
and how it's
developed from 9/11 until today.

46:54.412 --> 46:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Your weigh-in has
always been
the individual stories, right..

46:57.648 --> 46:59.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes.

46:59.583 --> 47:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... to tell a
larger story,
whether they're Americans or
Egyptians, Saudis,

47:03.454 --> 47:05.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Syrian filmmaker.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These people stay with you?

47:07.425 --> 47:11.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: It's a
privilege, first of
all, to be able to go out and
tell these stories,

47:11.495 --> 47:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but to meet these remarkable
individuals and
tell their stories.

47:16.300 --> 47:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's what I was born to do.

47:19.570 --> 47:23.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I don't think you can
understand terrorism,
radicalization.

47:23.441 --> 47:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we can analyze it to
death, but
unless you understand a single
individual's

47:30.548 --> 47:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journey, that makes it much more
clear, I
think, to the reader, and that's
what I aspire

47:36.020 --> 47:37.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

47:38.055 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I wanted to ask
you one particular
essay that hit me going back to
it, "Captured

47:41.258 --> 47:42.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on Film."

47:42.259 --> 47:43.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes.

47:44.061 --> 47:48.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This was from
Syria in 2006
about the very small film
industry at that

47:48.999 --> 47:49.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes.

47:51.736 --> 47:53.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you work, "I
found a people
who had been beaten into
silence."

47:54.071 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, these years later, it's
impossible to
think about a film industry when
we think

47:59.710 --> 48:00.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Syria.

48:01.045 --> 48:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But do you see a connection to
what you saw
then to today?

48:04.949 --> 48:07.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes,
unfortunately.

48:07.718 --> 48:11.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason I went there is, you
know, the
Middle East is a very valuable
place.

48:11.555 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a paradise for reporters,
except when
they're targeted.

48:14.959 --> 48:16.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:16.393 --> 48:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: But I thought,
one day, Syria
is so quiet.

48:21.298 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was like the dog that
didn't bark.

48:24.135 --> 48:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I went to the editor at "The
New Yorker"
with this observation.

48:27.872 --> 48:29.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that's not a story.

48:29.740 --> 48:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I thought, well, people know
about America
through our movies.

48:34.545 --> 48:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I will go to Syria and I
will watch their
movies and talk to their
filmmakers and see

48:39.817 --> 48:41.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if I can understand their
culture.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And physical abuse was a common
element.

48:44.822 --> 48:50.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody I met had been beaten,
by their
parents, or their schoolteachers
or the police.

48:50.961 --> 48:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, it was a culture that
had already
suffered an enormous amount of
trauma.

48:57.835 --> 49:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you know, my fixer, this
lovely young
woman, her...

49:01.772 --> 49:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fixer is the
local producer
there.

49:04.308 --> 49:06.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes.

49:06.210 --> 49:09.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her parents had been in
political prison,
her mother for two-and-a-half
years, her father

49:09.980 --> 49:11.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for 13 years.

49:11.415 --> 49:12.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He had been tortured.

49:12.416 --> 49:14.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had been locked in isolation.

49:14.752 --> 49:16.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so he came home.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did he do?

49:17.855 --> 49:21.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He beat her up on a number of
occasions and
locked her in her room.

49:21.892 --> 49:25.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was a common tale.

49:25.229 --> 49:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of times, when
America wanders
into regions that it so poorly
understands,

49:34.872 --> 49:37.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we don't know what we're facing.

49:37.708 --> 49:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq was a classic example of us
becoming
involved in a culture that we
totally didn't

49:45.249 --> 49:46.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
understand.

49:47.084 --> 49:49.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Finally, I want
to ask you
about -- because you're also
looking at us,

49:49.320 --> 49:50.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right, 15 years later.

49:50.788 --> 49:52.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: Yes.

49:52.723 --> 49:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fifteen years
later, 15 years
ago, people said the world has
changed; 9/11

49:54.859 --> 49:55.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changed everything.

49:55.926 --> 49:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did it, when you look back now?

49:58.996 --> 50:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: America's
changed profoundly.

50:02.199 --> 50:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I reflect on the fact that I
took a date
to the airport one time when I
was a young

50:08.973 --> 50:10.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
man in high school.

50:10.641 --> 50:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't have money to take her
out.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was Dallas, Texas.

50:14.311 --> 50:15.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was called Love Field.

50:15.713 --> 50:17.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

50:17.548 --> 50:22.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: So -- but back,
then we walked
out on the tarmac and climbed up
into this

50:22.152 --> 50:26.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international jetliner that had
just come
in from Paris, we supposed.

50:26.891 --> 50:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we sat in the first-class
section, and
the stewardess brought us a
snack.

50:31.996 --> 50:34.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we went up in the FAA
tower.

50:34.131 --> 50:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I opened the unlocked door.

50:35.499 --> 50:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they said, come on in, kids.

50:36.967 --> 50:40.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we sat down and watched them
land the
planes.

50:40.504 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That America is long dead, and
terrorism killed
it.

50:45.976 --> 50:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if it's forgotten, if that
community of
trust and safety is forgotten,
then I think

50:55.119 --> 51:01.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we will have lost in some
way in this
battle against terrorism.

51:02.092 --> 51:05.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are the liberties that we
had, freedoms.

51:05.996 --> 51:08.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we often talk about that
that's what we're
fighting for.

51:08.565 --> 51:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at the same time, we're
compromising
all those very freedoms.

51:12.036 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not saying that some of
those compromises
aren't necessary, but we need to
keep in our

51:17.574 --> 51:23.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart the idea that there was a
country where
those kinds of freedoms were
freely exercised.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is "The
Terror Years."

51:25.649 --> 51:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lawrence Wright, thank you so
much.

51:28.419 --> 51:34.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWRENCE WRIGHT: My pleasure.

51:34.925 --> 51:42.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
"NewsHour" online:
Spirits were up in Miami this
week when 56

51:42.333 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the world's five best
bartenders faced
off in an intense competition.

51:46.503 --> 51:51.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jennifer Le Nechet of France
took home the
crown, becoming the first woman
to win the

51:51.342 --> 51:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
title of Bartender of the Year.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Find our video of the event on
our home page.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:57.181 --> 52:02.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs
from our PBS colleagues.

52:02.286 --> 52:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later this evening.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a preview:

52:07.758 --> 52:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Five days later,
Donald Trump
is keeping one story alive, not
about immigration

52:12.062 --> 52:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the economy or trade, but
about what he
had to say about a beauty queen.

52:17.267 --> 52:22.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, the president loses a
fight with Congress
over whether 9/11 victims should
be able to

52:22.272 --> 52:24.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sue one of our allies.

52:24.475 --> 52:28.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a counterintuitive week,
but we will
explain why it all kind of makes
political

52:28.345 --> 52:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sense tonight on "Washington
Week" -- Hari.

52:31.415 --> 52:33.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Gwen.

52:33.350 --> 52:37.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend": an
elite team of
disaster relief workers on an
urgent mission

52:38.022 --> 52:40.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to save Italy's cultural
heritage.

52:40.324 --> 52:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's tomorrow's signature
segment.

52:42.526 --> 52:43.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:43.694 --> 52:44.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

52:44.695 --> 52:45.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

52:45.696 --> 53:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
