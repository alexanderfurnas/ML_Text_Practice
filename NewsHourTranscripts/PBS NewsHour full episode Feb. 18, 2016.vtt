JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.774 --> 00:14.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
pontifical politics.
Pope Francis sparks a firestorm,
calling Donald

00:14.481 --> 00:21.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's immigration ideas not
Christian, as
the Republican front-runner
fires back.

00:21.555 --> 00:28.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, President Obama
announces an historic
trip to Cuba next month, the
first for a sitting

00:28.228 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president in almost 90 years.

00:30.697 --> 00:35.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: why you should look to the
political
betting markets for presidential
predictions.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE JACKSON, The Huffington
Post: Polls
show what people are thinking
now, whereas

00:40.073 --> 00:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prediction markets are what
people think
will happen in the future.

00:43.677 --> 00:47.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.414 --> 00:51.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.785 --> 01:05.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It may be
unprecedented, and
it lit up the presidential
campaign today.

01:05.432 --> 01:11.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A sitting pope crossed verbal
swords with
a candidate for president of the
United States,

01:11.171 --> 01:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just ahead of a crucial primary.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our political director, Lisa
Desjardins, has
our report.

01:16.576 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: No, this is not
your typical
presidential critic, definitely
not your typical

01:22.282 --> 01:24.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticism.

01:24.184 --> 01:28.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): A person who thinks
only about

01:28.722 --> 01:33.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building walls, wherever they
may be, and
not of building bridges, is not
Christian.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not the Gospel.

01:35.796 --> 01:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On his flight
home from Mexico,
Pope Francis directly addressed
Donald Trump.

01:40.334 --> 01:44.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican front-runner has
advocated
building a wall along the length
of the U.S.-Mexican

01:45.072 --> 01:51.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
border. And last week, he said
the pope's
trip to that border was a
political ploy encouraged

01:51.111 --> 01:52.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Mexico.

01:53.013 --> 01:57.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): And am
I a pawn? Well, maybe. I will
leave that to

01:57.784 --> 01:59.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your judgment.

01:59.686 --> 02:04.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The pope
pointedly told reporters
he is not recommending how
anyone votes.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In South Carolina, the candidate
wasted no
time in issuing his retort.

02:07.594 --> 02:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
No leader, especially a
religious leader,

02:11.431 --> 02:17.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should have the right to
question another
man's religion or faith,
especially when they

02:17.337 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feed all sorts of false
information into him.

02:19.973 --> 02:24.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump quickly
transformed
the debate over Christian values
into a fight

02:24.511 --> 02:26.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over security.

02:26.546 --> 02:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If and when the
Vatican is attacked
by ISIS, which, as everyone
knows, is ISIS'

02:32.452 --> 02:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ultimate trophy, I can promise
you that the
pope would have only wished and
prayed that

02:39.192 --> 02:42.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump would have been
president, because...

02:42.496 --> 02:44.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:44.531 --> 02:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's true. It's
true, because
this would not have happened.
ISIS would have

02:51.671 --> 02:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been eradicated, unlike what is
happening
now with our all-talk, no-action
politicians.

02:58.412 --> 03:03.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While the
would-be president
took on the pontiff, Marco Rubio
happily joined

03:03.617 --> 03:07.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces with South Carolina
Governor Nikki
Haley one day after her
endorsement.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), South
Carolina: We need
to show that South Carolina
makes presidents

03:11.892 --> 03:14.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that our next president will
be Marco
Rubio.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:17.097 --> 03:21.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Two days before
South Carolina's
primary, most non-Trump
Republicans are playing

03:21.535 --> 03:26.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it safe and sticking to stump
lines. But in
Greenville last night, Rubio
confronted the

03:26.473 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
volatile issue of racism by
police and the
criminal justice system.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
But whether you agree with them
or not, if

03:32.412 --> 03:36.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a significant percentage of the
American family
believes that they are being
treated differently

03:36.883 --> 03:40.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than everyone else, we have a
problem. And
we have to address it as a
society and as

03:40.654 --> 03:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a country, because I do not
believe we can
fulfill our potential as a
nation unless we

03:45.058 --> 03:45.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
address that.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for the
Democrats:

03:48.061 --> 03:49.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm going to do everything I can
so you don't

03:49.229 --> 03:50.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to be scared.

03:51.098 --> 03:54.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In a new ad,
Hillary Clinton
sought to reach Latino voters in
Nevada by

03:54.501 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stressing her opposition to most
deportations.

03:57.370 --> 04:02.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bernie Sanders also was
appealing to Latinos,
with this ad highlighting a key
endorsement

04:03.043 --> 04:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the state's Democratic
caucuses on
Saturday. The two, who are
currently neck

04:08.482 --> 04:12.686 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
and neck in the
first-in-the-West contest,
will take voter questions at a
town hall event

04:12.786 --> 04:14.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tonight in Las Vegas.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:17.190 --> 04:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pope also
made headlines
today on the Zika virus,
suggesting that women

04:22.729 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threatened with it could use
artificial contraception.
Roman Catholic doctrine teaches
birth control

04:28.935 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is wrong, but Francis said,
under the circumstances,
it might be necessary.

04:33.006 --> 04:41.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): Avoiding
a pregnancy is not an absolute
evil. In certain

04:41.414 --> 04:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases, as in this one, it is
clear. I would
also exhort the doctors that
they do everything

04:45.785 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can to find vaccines and
things against
these mosquitoes that bring
sickness.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at all the pope's statements
today after the

04:54.027 --> 04:55.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news summary.

04:55.896 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon said today it has
asked Russia
to steer clear of bombing near
U.S. special

05:00.667 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces in Northern Syria. It
said the Russian
military was given broad areas
to avoid, but

05:06.873 --> 05:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the exact locations of
American troops.
And a spokesman said the
Russians have honored

05:12.579 --> 05:14.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the request so far.

05:15.081 --> 05:21.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Turkey is blaming Kurdish
militants at home
and in Syria for a suicide
bombing in Ankara.

05:21.121 --> 05:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday's blast killed 28
people and wounded
dozens more. The Turks answered
today with

05:27.127 --> 05:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
air raids in Northern Iraq on
the outlawed
Kurdish rebel group PKK, and
they insisted

05:33.466 --> 05:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again the group is linked to
Syrian Kurds
backed by the U.S.

05:37.604 --> 05:42.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): We have not been
able to convince

05:42.209 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international community, and
in particular
our friends, of the strong ties
between Kurdish

05:47.147 --> 05:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militias in Northern Syria and
the PKK. In
the face of this bombing, they
will probably

05:52.686 --> 05:54.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be conducive to a better
understanding.

05:54.821 --> 05:59.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
leader of a
Kurdish umbrella organization
said it's possible

05:59.793 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that rogue militants carried out
the bombing.

06:03.096 --> 06:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Uganda, delays and protests
plagued presidential
and parliamentary elections
today. And, at

06:08.835 --> 06:14.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one point, the main opposition
candidate was
briefly arrested. Some voters
waited more

06:14.274 --> 06:19.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than five hours because ballots
had not been
delivered. That sent protesters
into the streets

06:19.813 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
claiming the delays were
deliberate to help
keep the country's president in
office. Yoweri

06:25.585 --> 06:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Museveni has been in power for
30 years and
is seeking reelection.

06:31.057 --> 06:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leaders of the European Union
have opened
a crucial summit in Brussels
that could determine

06:35.795 --> 06:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether Britain stays or goes as
a member.
Prime minister David Cameron
arrived today,

06:41.668 --> 06:47.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
calling for a deal that
safeguards British
sovereignty, and helps him win a
summer referendum

06:48.008 --> 06:49.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on keeping London in the E.U.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: We
have got some important work to
do today and

06:52.746 --> 06:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow. And it's going to be
hard. I will
be battling for Britain. If we
can get a good

06:57.717 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal, I will take that deal. But
I will not
take a deal that doesn't meet
what we need.

07:03.156 --> 07:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's much more important
to get this
right than to do anything in a
rush.

07:07.294 --> 07:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Britain already
opts out of
the unified euro currency and it
wants the

07:12.032 --> 07:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
freedom to curb various benefits
for immigrants
from elsewhere in Europe.

07:17.470 --> 07:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a Los
Angeles area hospital
confirms that it paid $17,000 in
ransom to

07:24.177 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hackers who seized control of
its computer
network. Hollywood Presbyterian
Medical Center

07:30.150 --> 07:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says it happened earlier this
month. It regained
access to its network by paying
the ransom

07:35.755 --> 07:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Bitcoins, an online currency.
The FBI said
there have been numerous similar
attacks.

07:43.063 --> 07:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street's rally ran out
of gas today,
after advancing since Monday.
The Dow Jones

07:48.935 --> 07:56.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average lost 40
points to close
at 16413. The Nasdaq fell 46
points, and the

07:56.443 --> 07:58.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 shed nine.

07:58.345 --> 08:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Pope Francis'
surprising remarks on
contraceptives and on

08:04.751 --> 08:11.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump; the first
presidential visit
to Cuba in nearly 90 years;
who's taking bets

08:11.658 --> 08:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the presidential election;
and much more.

08:26.906 --> 08:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now back to that rare exchange
we saw play
out today between the pope and
presidential

08:32.178 --> 08:34.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
candidate Donald Trump.

08:34.147 --> 08:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Allen covers the Vatican
and the Catholic
Church for The Boston Globe and
its Web site,

08:39.652 --> 08:44.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crux. And Susan Page is the
Washington bureau
chief for USA Today.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

08:46.593 --> 08:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan, to you first, what did
you make of
the pope's remarks? And is there
any precedent

08:51.097 --> 08:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a pope injecting himself
this way into
a presidential race?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
I have covered 10 campaigns. I
have never

08:55.902 --> 09:00.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen anything like this, the
pope talking
very specifically about a
particularly candidate,

09:00.707 --> 09:03.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticizing him, saying he's
behaving in a
way that's not Christian.

09:03.977 --> 09:08.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never seen anything like
it, and the
candidate immediately shooting
back with very

09:08.448 --> 09:14.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harsh language, saying the
pope's language
was disgraceful. I think this is
truly uncharted

09:14.521 --> 09:16.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
waters here.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Allen, you
have covered
the Vatican for many years. Are
you aware

09:19.192 --> 09:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of any precedent? Has there been
a situation
like this where the pope has
spoken to directly

09:24.597 --> 09:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about an American election?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN, Associate Editor,
The Boston Globe:
Well, Judy, I have covered the
Vatican for

09:29.202 --> 09:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 20 years, covered three
popes.

09:31.671 --> 09:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am keenly aware that this is
an institution
that has an awful lot of history
under its

09:35.875 --> 09:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belt, so I am very reluctant to
use the word
unprecedented. As the late
Cardinal Francis

09:41.681 --> 09:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George of Chicago once artfully
put it, in
the Catholic Church, everything
has happened

09:45.819 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at least once.

09:47.620 --> 09:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm not sure this has ever
happened before.
I have certainly covered
tensions between

09:52.258 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sitting presidents and popes.
There were titanic
battles between the Clinton
administration

09:57.230 --> 10:02.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the Vatican over
reproductive freedom
in the 1990s.

10:02.602 --> 10:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pope John Paul II, now St. John
Paul, was
very critical of President
Bush's invasion

10:07.207 --> 10:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Iraq. We saw tensions between
Pope Benedict
and the Obama administration
over the contraception

10:12.979 --> 10:16.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mandates imposed by the White
House as part
of health care reform.

10:16.583 --> 10:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for a pope to go after not a
president,
but a presidential candidate, by
name, in

10:22.789 --> 10:27.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quite so incendiary a fashion,
no, I don't
think we have seen this before.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, John Allen,
staying with
you, how did you read it,
though? Because

10:29.963 --> 10:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not just Donald Trump.
There are a number
of Republicans who have said
there should

10:33.333 --> 10:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a wall, a big wall along the
border with
Mexico. How did you read the
pope just addressing

10:39.639 --> 10:41.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

10:41.407 --> 10:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: Well, look, Judy, if
you read
the full transcript of the
pope's remarks,

10:43.943 --> 10:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is very clear that the pope
does not in
any level of detail actually
know who Donald

10:49.649 --> 10:51.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump is.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said -- the question was put
to him by
one of our colleagues, Phil
Pullella from

10:54.521 --> 11:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Reuters news agency, about
Trump. And
the pope's response basically
was, well, listen,

11:00.159 --> 11:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assuming Trump has said what you
say he said,
and he said that all has to be
verified, I'm

11:05.832 --> 11:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving you the benefit of the
doubt, but,
assuming that, it is not a
Christian attitude.

11:10.136 --> 11:16.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, basically, the
pope's point was
that someone who wants to build
walls, rather

11:16.342 --> 11:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than bridges, who wants to try
to separate
themselves from people in need,
rather than

11:21.915 --> 11:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opening their hearts to them and
trying to
be of assistance to them, that
that is not

11:26.486 --> 11:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Christian attitude in keeping
with the Christian
Gospel.

11:29.856 --> 11:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What makes this particularly
saucy is that
he said that in the context of
Donald Trump

11:37.163 --> 11:42.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and thereby, perhaps not
deliberately, but
thereby injecting himself into
the 2016 campaign

11:42.869 --> 11:44.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

11:44.771 --> 11:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, what is
the effect likely
to be on Donald Trump? Could it
hurt him?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Could it help him?

11:50.577 --> 11:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think we have all
learned not
to predict that things are
catastrophic for

11:53.646 --> 11:54.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump...

11:54.280 --> 11:56.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: ... because he's
said one outrageous
thing after another, and it's
not really hurt

11:57.717 --> 11:58.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

11:58.851 --> 11:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I actually think this could help
in the short-term.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really?

12:01.588 --> 12:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: For one, he's doing
totally what
he always does. Right? You hit
him, he hits

12:05.058 --> 12:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you back, even if you're the
pope.

12:07.293 --> 12:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also talking about an issue
that launched
his presidential campaign, which
is immigration,

12:13.299 --> 12:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building a wall, stopping the
flow of illegal
immigrants from Mexico and
elsewhere. So,

12:18.237 --> 12:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in that way, it's helpful.

12:20.173 --> 12:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it could be harmful to
him in a general
election against Hillary Clinton
or a Democrat

12:24.210 --> 12:28.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is making big inroads among
Hispanic voters,
help her with Catholics.
Catholics are one

12:28.581 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the most crucial swing votes
that we have
in a general election. But when
you talk about

12:33.252 --> 12:35.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican nomination, I'm
not sure this
hurts him.

12:35.822 --> 12:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as -- and I
was just discussing
with John Allen, the pope is
really taking

12:39.959 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the entire Republican Party,
in a way,
because their position is, we
need to shore

12:44.130 --> 12:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up the border and stop Mexican
and other Central
American, South American
immigrants from coming

12:49.836 --> 12:51.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into the U.S.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And that's one
reason that his
Republican rivals will not be
able to go against

12:54.207 --> 12:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump on this issue, and in fact
chose not
to today, because when Jeb Bush,
for instance,

12:58.645 --> 13:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is himself Catholic, or John
Kasich or
Marco Rubio were asked about
this today, they

13:04.317 --> 13:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all reiterated the importance of
a secure
border and none of them really
went after

13:08.588 --> 13:10.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump on this issue.

13:10.523 --> 13:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John Allen,
the pope made
more news today -- it was not
just on Donald

13:14.961 --> 13:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump -- when he said it may be
acceptable
for women who are dealing with
the potential

13:21.467 --> 13:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Zika virus, the mosquito bite
that could lead
to the Zika virus, for them to
use artificial

13:26.806 --> 13:28.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contraception.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How significant that he said
that? This is
not church doctrine, we know.

13:31.210 --> 13:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: Well, Judy, I think
it's actually
potentially far more
consequential than his

13:35.782 --> 13:39.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
comments on Donald Trump,
because let's face
it, Pope Francis himself is not
in a position

13:39.952 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to directly control the outcome
of the 2016
election in the United States,
but he can

13:45.224 --> 13:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
control what the Catholic Church
does and
doesn't approve.

13:48.428 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in this case, what the pope
was taking
was a fairly traditional
position, actually.

13:53.466 --> 14:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He actually cited a precedent
from the early
1960s, when then Pope Paul VI
allowed Catholic

14:01.474 --> 14:06.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nuns in what was then the
Belgian Congo to
take contraception because they
were in a

14:06.979 --> 14:11.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation with widespread sexual
violence,
and they were trying to protect
themselves

14:11.284 --> 14:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from pregnancy as the result of
rape.

14:13.553 --> 14:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, the Vatican's
position was,
OK, this is not an issue of
using birth control

14:18.491 --> 14:25.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to try to prevent the
transmission of new
life. It is trying to prevent an
unjust harm.

14:25.998 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By a similar logic, the Vatican
has for years
taken the position that in the
context of

14:31.838 --> 14:37.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Africa, in the context of
HIV/AIDS, where
you have a married couple where
one couple

14:37.543 --> 14:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- is HIV-positive and the other
is not, and
they wish to use contraception
to try to prevent

14:43.483 --> 14:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other partner from being
infected, the
Vatican has consistently
described that as

14:47.820 --> 14:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an open question to which there
is no definitive
church dogma.

14:53.359 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is essentially what
Francis said
again today in the context of
the Zika virus.

14:57.396 --> 15:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we should be careful in
saying, Judy,
he didn't directly say, I
therefore approve

15:04.003 --> 15:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the use of contraception to try
to prevent
infection with Zika, but he
clearly left the

15:09.976 --> 15:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
door open to that, which is
going to encourage
pastors and moral theologians
and church officials

15:15.281 --> 15:17.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to continue to debate.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
John Allen, is
that likely to be controversial
inside the

15:20.453 --> 15:22.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
church?

15:22.388 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: Judy, pretty much
everything is
likely to be controversial
inside the church.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:27.593 --> 15:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: So, yes, I think
there will be
a healthy debate. Some will say
this is exactly

15:29.962 --> 15:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wrong time to be weakening
our position
on birth control. Others will
say that this

15:35.368 --> 15:38.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is a kind of commonsense
adaptation that they
welcome.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is going to be a
robust conversation
about it.

15:41.874 --> 15:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Allen, Susan
Page, another
extraordinary day in American
politics and

15:46.913 --> 15:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in covering religion around the
world. Thank
you both.

15:51.784 --> 15:58.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

15:58.591 --> 16:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN ALLEN: You're welcome.

16:05.464 --> 16:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On March 21,
President Obama
will make Cuba the first stop on
a trip to

16:13.372 --> 16:19.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latin America. It will be an
historic moment
that comes 14 months after Cuba
and the United

16:19.178 --> 16:21.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
States announced renewed
diplomatic ties.

16:21.914 --> 16:25.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, begins our coverage.

16:25.952 --> 16:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It will be the
first visit
to Cuba by a sitting American
president since

16:32.291 --> 16:39.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Calvin Coolidge in 1928.
President Obama announced
the plans on his official
Twitter feed today.

16:39.866 --> 16:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Deputy National Security
Adviser Ben Rhodes
outlined the goals.

16:43.569 --> 16:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RHODES, U.S. Deputy National
Security
Adviser: We see it as a means of
pushing forward

16:47.006 --> 16:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this normalization process,
trying to achieve
a greater opening between the
United States

16:52.879 --> 17:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Cuba commercially, but also
supporting
and advancing the values that we
care about.

17:00.286 --> 17:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The visit,
including talks
with Cuban leader Raul Castro,
follows more

17:05.591 --> 17:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than a year of work to thaw
relations. Embassies
reopened in both countries, and
the two nations

17:12.965 --> 17:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this week agreed to start daily
commercial
flights.

17:17.003 --> 17:22.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But these moves toward
normalization haven't
produced results as quickly as
hoped. Commerce

17:22.508 --> 17:27.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Penny Pritzker,
meeting Cuba's trade
minister in Washington this
week, complained

17:27.914 --> 17:33.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, despite Washington easing
restrictions
on U.S. companies wanting to do
business there,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Havana hasn't done the same.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rhodes echoed that today.

17:37.857 --> 17:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN RHODES: What we would like
to see is that
they are taking the types of
steps that allow

17:42.261 --> 17:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those regulatory changes to take
hold, that
allow U.S. businesses to start
to be able

17:48.467 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to operate in Cuba in ways that
benefit the
Cuban people.

17:51.637 --> 17:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Cuba argues the
U.S. is to
blame for lack of progress, as a
top Cuban

17:55.775 --> 17:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
official underscored today.

17:57.944 --> 18:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEFINA VIDAL, Cuban Foreign
Ministry (through
translator): Of course, to
achieve fully reestablishment

18:02.715 --> 18:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of those bilateral relations,
outstanding
issues would have to be
resolved, including

18:07.586 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lift of the embargo and the
return to
Cuba of the territory occupied
by a Naval

18:12.491 --> 18:14.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
base in Guantanamo.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Congress is
refusing to lift
the trade embargo and the White
House said

18:18.431 --> 18:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today the U.S. position on
retaining Guantanamo
has not changed.

18:24.403 --> 18:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human rights also remains a
point of contention.
Rhodes said today that Mr. Obama
will meet

18:31.243 --> 18:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with civil society activists
during his visit.
But leading Republicans urged
him not to go

18:36.515 --> 18:38.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

18:38.317 --> 18:42.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presidential candidate Marco
Rubio, son of
Cuban immigrants, spoke in a CNN
town hall

18:42.955 --> 18:44.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
There's no elections in Cuba.
There's no choice

18:46.826 --> 18:49.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Cuba. And so my whole
problem, I want the
relationship between the U.S.
and Cuba to

18:50.062 --> 18:54.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
change, but it has to be
reciprocal. And so,
today, a year and two months
after the opening

18:54.934 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Cuba, the Cuba government
remains as repressive
as ever.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Even so, the
White House
said lawmakers from both parties
will accompany

19:01.841 --> 19:02.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

19:05.711 --> 19:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We explore the
historical significance
now with William LeoGrande. He's
a specialist

19:11.217 --> 19:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Latin America at American
University. He's
written a number of books on
U.S.-Cuban relations.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And welcome back to the
"NewsHour," Bill LeoGrande.
Good to see you.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE, American
University: Thank
you. Good to be with you.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How big a deal is
this visit
by the president next month?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: Well, I think
it's historic.

19:26.799 --> 19:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as we look back on
it, we will
see that it's as significant as
Richard Nixon's

19:31.637 --> 19:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1972 trip to China, which was
really the symbolic
break in the old policy and a
policy -- a

19:39.445 --> 19:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new policy of engagement with
China.

19:41.380 --> 19:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the same way, this trip by
President Obama
is symbolic of the fundamental
shift that

19:46.852 --> 19:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he made in U.S.-Cuba policy back
in December
2014.

19:50.556 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what real
changes do
you see? We know, as Margaret
just reported,

19:55.027 --> 19:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the embargo, the trade
embargo still
exists. There is, what, any sign
Congress

19:59.999 --> 20:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is ready to look at that again?

20:01.934 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: Well, not
this year, because
we're in the middle of an
election year, but

20:05.638 --> 20:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next year, I think there is a
real opportunity
to revisit it.

20:08.941 --> 20:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of Republicans
who are pro-business
and whose constituents would
like to be able

20:14.780 --> 20:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to gain access to the Cuban
market. And I
think that -- and there are a
lot of Democrats,

20:19.251 --> 20:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, who have been in
favor of a new
policy toward Cuba for a long
time. And I

20:23.122 --> 20:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think there is the makings of a
coalition
once we get past the election.

20:27.059 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in the
meantime, what do
we look for as changes in the
U.S.-Cuba relationship?

20:32.398 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the president's tried to
do a few
things. Are they making any
difference?

20:36.001 --> 20:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: Well, I think
they are.

20:37.837 --> 20:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have already seen agreements
on a whole
range of issues of mutual
interest, civil

20:41.841 --> 20:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aviation, the restoration of
postal service,
environmental protection. I
think we will

20:46.612 --> 20:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see more agreements in the next
11 months
on other issues of mutual
agreement, particularly

20:52.218 --> 20:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the law enforcement area.

20:54.587 --> 21:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're also seeing a lot of
new commercial
interests and a lot of
businesses going down

21:00.526 --> 21:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, trying to see if Cuba
offers a real
opportunity for business.

21:04.663 --> 21:08.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as I
understand it, it's
still a narrow slice here and a
narrow slice

21:08.767 --> 21:10.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: The embargo
is still really
important.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until the embargo is gone,
we're going
to be playing at the margins, if
you will.

21:15.641 --> 21:20.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, nevertheless, the
regulatory changes
the president has made in the
last year have

21:20.246 --> 21:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really opened up a number of
business opportunities.

21:22.848 --> 21:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we just
heard Senator
Marco Rubio say, we're talking
about an oppressive

21:28.020 --> 21:29.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much change, if any, has
there been in
Cuba's human rights record?

21:32.892 --> 21:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: There's been
very little
change on the human rights
front. And the

21:35.861 --> 21:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cuban government is no more
tolerant of dissidents
today than it was a year ago.

21:40.232 --> 21:45.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the problem with that
criticism, it seems
to me, is that, for 54 years, we
pursued a

21:45.137 --> 21:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy of hostility and coercion
to try to
force Cuba to behave better and
become more

21:50.176 --> 21:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
democratic, and it didn't work.
So, it seems
to me that the president
deserves at least

21:53.946 --> 21:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than a year to try to see
if his policy
will make a difference.

21:56.982 --> 22:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You started out
comparing this
to Nixon's visit to China. What
do you see?

22:02.655 --> 22:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what do you think the
U.S.-Cuba relationship
could like five, 10 years from
now?

22:07.793 --> 22:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: Oh, I -- Cuba
and the United
States are really natural
partners. If we

22:11.263 --> 22:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go back historically, Cuba and
the United
States had a very close,
integrated cultural

22:17.136 --> 22:19.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relationship, an economic
relationship.

22:19.371 --> 22:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem from the Cuban side
was that the
United States dominated the
island politically.

22:24.376 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we can engage at the
political level
with mutual respect, respecting
Cuba's independence,

22:30.249 --> 22:34.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there are all kinds of
opportunities for cultural
exchange and economic
development.

22:34.620 --> 22:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is
despite the fact
that the Cuban leadership is
still very critical

22:39.358 --> 22:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States in many
ways.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: They are very
critical
of the United States, but they
tend now to

22:44.663 --> 22:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be more critical of specific
U.S. policies,
like the embargo and our
presence in Guantanamo,

22:50.469 --> 22:55.574 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
as opposed to the
across-the-board denunciation
of the United States that we
used to hear

22:55.674 --> 22:57.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a few years ago.

22:57.343 --> 23:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Professor William
LeoGrande
of American University, we thank
you.

23:02.114 --> 23:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM LEOGRANDE: My pleasure.

23:10.456 --> 23:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:15.494 --> 23:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
righting the
wrongs of the civil rights era;
the complex

23:20.866 --> 23:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and controversial sourcing
network behind
the Web site TMZ; plus, Peyton
Manning's alleged

23:28.007 --> 23:29.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sexual assault.

23:29.808 --> 23:35.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, a different take on
predicting
the outcomes of presidential
races.

23:35.447 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
looks at how a kind of betting
market has

23:39.718 --> 23:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fared in recent years when it
comes to forecasting
winners. It's part of his weekly
series, Making

23:45.791 --> 23:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sense, every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

23:48.327 --> 23:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And they're off.
The candidates
are out of the gate, around the
first turn

23:55.968 --> 24:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and at full gallop in America's
quadrennial
race to elect a president.

24:00.539 --> 24:05.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, as at the track, one
question overshadows
all others: Who's going to win?

24:05.544 --> 24:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Sixty percent.

24:07.546 --> 24:11.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like every other
candidate, if
somewhat more loudly, Donald
Trump keeps pointing

24:11.483 --> 24:13.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the polls.

24:13.419 --> 24:18.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Here's an
important one, best
chance of winning in November.
Trump, number

24:18.457 --> 24:19.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one, 47 percent.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:21.660 --> 24:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But when it comes
to presidential
prognostication, what source is
your best

24:26.065 --> 24:33.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bet? A poll? A pundit? A
real-time trending
Google search? Turns out it's
none of the

24:33.339 --> 24:35.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
above.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHSCHILD, Microsoft
Research: I think
that the markets have really
been ahead of

24:37.509 --> 24:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the polling and ahead of the
pundits.

24:39.445 --> 24:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because, says David
Rothschild,
who studies them, political
prediction markets

24:43.816 --> 24:46.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
incorporate all available
information.

24:46.185 --> 24:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHSCHILD: This is where
markets have
a huge advantage over the
smartest people

24:51.190 --> 24:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just dealing with polling or
historical data.
We looked at the 2012 elections.
We looked

24:56.729 --> 25:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at all the primaries. We looked
at all the
senatorial, gubernatorial,
presidential elections.

25:00.766 --> 25:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see something that is
more accurate
than any collection of pundits
or statistical

25:05.137 --> 25:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
polling averages, and extremely
well-calibrated.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE JACKSON, The Huffington
Post: Polls
show what people are thinking
now, whereas

25:11.944 --> 25:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prediction markets are what
people think
will happen in the future.

25:15.514 --> 25:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, says
Natalie Jackson,
senior polling editor for The
Huffington Post,

25:20.352 --> 25:22.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology has made polling more
dicey.

25:22.855 --> 25:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE JACKSON: We're seeing a
huge drop-off
in landline telephones, which
was pollsters'

25:28.327 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bread and butter for a long
time.

25:30.262 --> 25:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: John Phillips heads
a nonpartisan
political technology company
called Aristotle.

25:35.801 --> 25:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His firm built and operates
PredictIt, one
of just two places Americans can
legally bet

25:41.707 --> 25:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on or, Phillips would prefer I
say, invest
in political predictions, though
no more than

25:47.813 --> 25:49.615 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
$850.

25:49.715 --> 25:54.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, as at the race track or
stock market,
you're putting your money where
your mouth

25:54.319 --> 25:56.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS, CEO, Aristotle:
And that's
the beauty of putting just a
little bit of

25:57.990 --> 26:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money on it. It all of a sudden
becomes a
matter of pride, but it also
becomes a matter

26:01.660 --> 26:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of focus. You want to see how
your investment's
doing.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Phillips gave me a
tutorial on
how PredictIt works. I'm a guy
who loves to

26:09.034 --> 26:15.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play long shots. My father
worked at the racetrack
for many years when I was a kid.
So, I would

26:15.307 --> 26:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go with John Kasich at 2 cents.
All he has
to do is go up to 4 cents, and I
have doubled

26:19.378 --> 26:20.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my money, right?

26:20.712 --> 26:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: Well, yes, if he
goes up to
4 cents or...

26:22.915 --> 26:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, what the heck?
I bought 25
shares.

26:25.484 --> 26:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: Here you got --
here's your
50 cents up here. You are now
the proud owner.

26:29.521 --> 26:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Of John Kasich at 2
cents to
win the Nevada primary, that is.

26:35.961 --> 26:40.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to the thrill of
victory, the
agony of defeat, and the chance
to make money,

26:40.732 --> 26:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PredictIt provides a passel of
information
about the race.

26:43.869 --> 26:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: Now, there are 84
comments
on this particular market right
now.

26:48.173 --> 26:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, look, Clinton
36 cents.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the Democratic primary
market in
Colorado.

26:54.880 --> 27:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the market has suddenly
collapsed. So
I think I will go with that. And
now, if I

27:01.353 --> 27:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to buy Bernie Sanders in
another market,
to level the playing field, and
so Oklahoma,

27:09.728 --> 27:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is down to 22 cents in
Oklahoma, so
I'm going to buy Sanders. Offer
matched. Close.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.071 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I'm in.

27:19.171 --> 27:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm rooting for Bernie
Sanders in Oklahoma,
Hillary Clinton in Colorado, and
John Kasich

27:26.245 --> 27:28.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Nevada.

27:28.146 --> 27:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other larger online political
markets, like
Ireland's Paddy Power and
Britain's Betfair,

27:33.752 --> 27:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
echo the odds on PredictIt and
take as much
as you want to bet. But they're
illegal for

27:38.323 --> 27:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. citizens to play. PredictIt
got government
approval by limiting the amount
to $850 per

27:44.129 --> 27:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
market and casting itself as
both an investment
marketplace and academic
research tool, since

27:50.469 --> 27:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it began as a project at New
Zealand's Victoria
University.

27:53.272 --> 27:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: We provide the
technology.
Once the data is collected, it's
anonymized,

27:58.777 --> 28:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then there are research
agreements with
almost two dozen U.S.
universities and Oxford

28:05.417 --> 28:06.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you're still
betting real
money.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You keep saying investing, but
it is betting,
isn't it?

28:11.690 --> 28:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: I see it as a
stock market.
A funny thing happens when
people try to figure

28:16.662 --> 28:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out what is going to happen
tomorrow or a
week down the road. And if I can
put a little

28:21.400 --> 28:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit of money in the outcome that
I'm expecting,
I think that's a stock market.

28:26.605 --> 28:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Can we compromise
on agreeing
that it's gambling?

28:30.008 --> 28:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: I think you can
call it anything
you want.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But whatever you
call it, says
researcher Rothschild:

28:35.113 --> 28:38.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHSCHILD: The people who
are playing
the market are taking the pulse
of the general

28:38.784 --> 28:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
population, and they have done
so accurately
for long enough that we can
trust that they're

28:43.188 --> 28:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understanding how things are
impacting very
quickly.

28:45.857 --> 28:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But PredictIt chief
John Phillips
says his market provides
something more: a

28:51.430 --> 28:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prod to democratic involvement.

28:53.498 --> 28:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN PHILLIPS: These traders not
only pay
more attention to politics, but
they also

28:58.370 --> 29:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are more likely to vote. Even
though it's
only a $1 winner
take-all-contract with an

29:05.043 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$850 limit, it still starts to
cause you to
think about things differently,
and that's

29:10.248 --> 29:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the magic here. It may be that
it is an engagement
tool for the 20-year-olds.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Researcher
Rothschild agrees.

29:16.822 --> 29:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ROTHSCHILD: People will
start paying
attention in a way that they
never did before,

29:20.892 --> 29:27.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so they will make an effort
to learn about
politics, to understand
politics, to engage

29:27.132 --> 29:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in politics, in a way that is
very, very beneficial
to our society.

29:31.403 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: My session with
PredictIt's John
Phillips was almost over, but I
couldn't resist

29:36.408 --> 29:39.044 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
checking in on my
2-cents-a-share Kasich
investment.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

29:41.446 --> 29:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It had actually gone down.

29:45.250 --> 29:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Down to 1 cent. This is just 50
cents, so
its impact on my financial
future is minimal.

29:54.693 --> 30:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I can feel myself rooting
for Kasich to
go up. It's just preposterous,
but, I mean,

30:01.933 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can feel it. I can feel it.

30:04.136 --> 30:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what happened? Well, as of
today on PredictIt,
John Kasich has bottomed out in
Nevada, where

30:10.475 --> 30:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is now heavily
favored. In the
Democratic primary in Colorado,
Sanders is

30:16.548 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the heavy favorite, and I just
sold Hillary
Clinton at a loss.

30:20.552 --> 30:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have done more than OK in
Oklahoma.
Clinton is still favored, but I
sold surging

30:26.158 --> 30:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders at nearly double what I
paid for him.
Bottom line, a $1.33 profit, or
a better than

30:33.331 --> 30:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
13 percent return on investment
in less than
a week.

30:37.269 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and the
power of markets,
this is economics correspondent
Paul Solman,

30:43.608 --> 30:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wishing the rest of you the best
of luck.

30:49.047 --> 31:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, another in
our Race Matters
series.

31:01.560 --> 31:05.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault
traveled to Montgomery, Alabama,
to speak

31:05.831 --> 31:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with former police Chief Kevin
Murphy about
the solutions he found in trying
to create

31:11.203 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a more responsive and
cooperative police force.

31:15.173 --> 31:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: During
the 50th anniversary
of police violence against
peaceful civil

31:22.047 --> 31:27.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rights marchers in Selma,
Alabama, that ended
in Montgomery, police Chief
Kevin Murphy did

31:27.786 --> 31:33.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something surprising. He
apologized to Congressman
John Lewis, a frequent victim of
that earlier

31:33.658 --> 31:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence, and handed him his
badge.

31:35.627 --> 31:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We caught up with Murphy, where
he now works
as Montgomery County deputy
sheriff, and where

31:41.066 --> 31:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of his solutions are still
in place.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kevin Murphy, thank you for
joining us.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY, Montgomery County,
Alabama,
Chief Deputy: Thank you for
having me.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What
moved you to
hand John Lewis your badge that
day?

31:50.275 --> 31:54.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY: Well, as a young
officer, I
had seen Congressman Lewis and
the congressional

31:55.013 --> 31:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegation Faith and Politics
come to Montgomery
over a several-year period. They
would follow

32:00.051 --> 32:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the civil rights trail and they
would come
and spend time in Montgomery.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a young member of the
department, I
would see him and wonder, why
hasn't anyone

32:08.894 --> 32:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever acknowledged the injustices
that occurred
here and thought, if I ever
become police

32:16.201 --> 32:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief, I'm going to change that.
And then
the day did arrive when they
were to come

32:21.540 --> 32:23.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Montgomery for their annual
tour.

32:23.475 --> 32:29.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I didn't tell anybody. I
didn't want it
to be a political act. I wanted
it to be sincere

32:29.347 --> 32:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and heartfelt, and the respect
that I have
for Congressman Lewis is
immeasurable.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
he's told me
he has the same for you.

32:37.923 --> 32:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In your early days as a police
officer, you
asked questions. What kind of
questions did

32:42.894 --> 32:45.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you ask, and what kind of
responses did you
get?

32:45.330 --> 32:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY: I found that a lot
of the officers
who had really lived through
that era, particularly

32:51.603 --> 32:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the white officers, were very
reluctant and
uncomfortable with talking about
it.

32:55.540 --> 33:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, when
you became
chief, what steps did you take
to change what

33:00.612 --> 33:02.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you saw as the wrongs?

33:02.447 --> 33:06.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY: One of the first
things that
I implemented as the new police
chief was

33:06.351 --> 33:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enacting a class, creating a
class.

33:08.720 --> 33:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went way back in history to
the Dred Scott
decision all the way through to
the Emmett

33:13.458 --> 33:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Till case, because I wanted the
officers to
experience what really happened.

33:20.198 --> 33:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, what my observation
was is, you
have a 21-year-old officer who
had never lived

33:25.904 --> 33:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through or seen the civil rights
era for what
it was, the dark reality of it.
And so this

33:32.644 --> 33:38.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young officer would stop an
African-American
citizen and get somewhat of a
pushback, because

33:38.550 --> 33:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe this 60- or 75-year-old
African-American
citizen's last encounter with a
Montgomery

33:44.923 --> 33:47.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
police officer was very
negative.

33:47.859 --> 33:52.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After they attended the class, I
saw a lot
of promise, in that, the next
time they encountered

33:52.864 --> 33:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that citizen, they felt like: I
understand
now.

33:56.067 --> 33:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
put this class
-- you got this class put into
the police

33:59.537 --> 34:00.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
academy's training.

34:00.605 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN MURPHY: I did.

34:02.641 --> 34:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we actually had all members
of the department,
not just the sworn officers, but
the civilians,

34:08.213 --> 34:13.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attended as well, and had
tremendous feedback.
The first part of the course is
classroom,

34:13.952 --> 34:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then a tour of the Rosa Parks
Museum.

34:16.054 --> 34:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my favorite part of the
class was the
conclusion, where there was a
values segment.

34:21.860 --> 34:28.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the values segment was
giving scenarios
to the members of the class. It
was strongly

34:28.300 --> 34:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agree, somewhat agree, strongly
disagree,
somewhat disagree.

34:32.337 --> 34:38.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I was proud of the answers
and the outcomes
of those scenarios, because they
were learning

34:38.410 --> 34:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the class that, you know,
you have to
be very careful in the way that
you apply

34:45.050 --> 34:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this power. And, you know, we're
seeing it
in the country now.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that we were
teaching that in
this class, how to de-escalate a
situation

34:52.023 --> 34:57.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where a citizen was upset
because they thought
that they were going to be
mistreated when

34:57.829 --> 35:04.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they saw the patch of the
Montgomery Police
Department, and it was the
officer's responsibility

35:04.836 --> 35:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ensure that citizen that that
wasn't going
to occur.

35:07.739 --> 35:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What do
you think
in that experience is replicable
or has any

35:13.278 --> 35:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of application today?

35:15.246 --> 35:18.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEVIN MURPHY: I think law
enforcement needs
to get to work.

35:18.216 --> 35:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that one of the
biggest challenges
that we face in this new century
is our response

35:25.790 --> 35:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what I would call a critical
event, where
you have a citizen who's become
violent, a

35:33.498 --> 35:37.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
citizen who's under the
influence of drugs
or perhaps they are suffering
from some type

35:37.869 --> 35:40.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of mental health issue.

35:40.205 --> 35:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I have seen with a lot
of these encounters
that end very badly, with the
death of an

35:45.744 --> 35:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unarmed citizen, is a fear on
the part of
the officer. And we all
experience it in this

35:55.053 --> 35:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uniform. It's nothing to be
ashamed of, but
you have to be able to manage
that fear. And

35:59.991 --> 36:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe, sometimes, when fear
steps in,
poor decisions are made. And I
think that

36:05.530 --> 36:08.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the use of deadly force falls
into that category.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, what
do you do
about it?

36:10.101 --> 36:14.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY: We need to be able
to teach
the officers, the deputies
coming into this

36:14.305 --> 36:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
profession how to manage your
fear. No one
ever did that to us, my
generation.

36:19.344 --> 36:24.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What do
you think
is the most important thing to
do now to ensure

36:24.382 --> 36:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that everybody, the police are
respected,
as well as those who deserve to
be protected

36:31.322 --> 36:33.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the police and even those who
commit crimes?

36:33.892 --> 36:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY: Law enforcement
needs to start
holding themselves accountable.

36:39.097 --> 36:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're starting to see it in
some parts
of the country, where officers
are being held

36:44.869 --> 36:49.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accountable, and there are
consequences for
bad behavior.

36:49.674 --> 36:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: A lot of
the people
who have been victims of
improper police behavior

36:55.713 --> 37:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were innocent, but what do you
do when you
have got criminals? I mean, not
everybody

37:02.454 --> 37:04.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is innocent.

37:04.355 --> 37:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN MURPHY: It's not a police
officer's
job to punish. We're there to
enforce the

37:08.326 --> 37:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
law and to take people into
custody.

37:10.562 --> 37:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think you have seen in
some instances,
and certainly back in the latter
-- early

37:16.734 --> 37:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the latter parts of the last
century,
that, you know, law enforcement
felt like

37:20.538 --> 37:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was their role to punish.
And, you know,
it's our responsibility to
apprehend and bring

37:27.445 --> 37:29.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these people before the courts.

37:29.948 --> 37:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there is no such thing
as street
justice. You have to abide by
the law when

37:35.220 --> 37:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're wearing the uniform and
set the example.
When you don't do that, you have
lost all

37:41.192 --> 37:43.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
credibility with the public that
you serve.

37:43.595 --> 37:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Kevin Murphy,
thank you.

37:49.434 --> 37:56.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEVIN MURPHY: Thank you.

37:56.441 --> 38:05.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a look at how
the popular
media and gossip site TMZ works,
and how it's

38:05.783 --> 38:07.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changing that business.

38:07.619 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The site is often the leading
destination
of celebrity news and even
notable national

38:12.790 --> 38:19.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scandal. TMZ obtained the video
of football
running back Ray Rice knocking
his then-fiancee

38:19.664 --> 38:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unconscious in a casino
elevator.

38:22.433 --> 38:27.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Before that, it released
recordings of racist
remarks made by Donald Sterling,
who was,

38:27.205 --> 38:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the time, the owner of the
Los Angeles
Clippers.

38:29.841 --> 38:33.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"The New Yorker" magazine
published an investigation
of TMZ.

38:33.978 --> 38:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jeffrey Brown spoke with the
writer, Nicholas
Schmidle, earlier this week.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nicholas
Schmidle, welcome
to you.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE, "The New
Yorker": Thanks.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: First, how do you
describe
what TMZ is and does?

38:45.089 --> 38:46.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Sure.

38:46.958 --> 38:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, TMZ is a celebrity news
site. It is kind
of -- it's in the same vein as
The National

38:53.031 --> 38:59.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enquirer. But what they are
doing is much
more sort of documentary-based
celebrity news

38:59.804 --> 39:00.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporting, and in a way...

39:00.872 --> 39:02.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Documentary,
meaning what?

39:02.740 --> 39:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Meaning
posting Videos,
posting pictures, posting court
documents,

39:08.680 --> 39:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing stories about celebrity
news and celebrity
gossip that are sort of
unimpeachable.

39:12.650 --> 39:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, a celebrity news
report might
have come out, and a celebrity
might have

39:18.323 --> 39:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been able to say, no, that's not
true and
dismissed it and had publicists
sort of stand

39:22.393 --> 39:24.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the way.

39:24.329 --> 39:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TMZ goes to you with the video
and says, this
is what we're running in a few
hours. Do you

39:27.098 --> 39:28.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a comment?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, what you're
also showing,
I mean, on one hand, as you say,
nothing new

39:31.202 --> 39:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this kind of gossip and
celebrity journalism,
but they have changed the game,
upped the

39:37.375 --> 39:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
game, a lot of it, as you have
shown, through
some old-fashioned reporting.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Right.

39:43.548 --> 39:47.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, there is. There is a
shoe-leather reporting
aspect to it. They have more --
they have

39:48.086 --> 39:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dedicated more resources to
court reporting.
They have three full-time court
reporters

39:51.623 --> 39:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Los Angeles courthouse.
The Los Angeles
Times has one.

39:56.327 --> 40:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are working -- I mean,
their reporters
work very, very hard. The
difference is, is

40:02.600 --> 40:06.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is not a lot of
enterprise reporting
going on. They're not
identifying a story

40:06.471 --> 40:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they want to going after and
pursuing it.
Most of what they're getting is
coming in

40:09.974 --> 40:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through tips. It's very clear at
the top of
the TMZ Web site how to get
stories in. There

40:14.412 --> 40:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a tip line. There's an e-mail
and...

40:16.047 --> 40:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, and hundreds
come in any
given day.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Exactly.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, of course,
the other big
difference is that they pay,
right?

40:21.452 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: They do.

40:23.521 --> 40:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sometimes large
amounts, sometimes
smaller amounts, but that's
always a possibility

40:26.658 --> 40:27.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their stories.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Absolutely.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lot of money changing
hands. Over
the -- $40, $50 over the course
of the day

40:31.729 --> 40:37.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as photographers are paying
sources in the
airport, or paying sources at
hotels, restaurants,

40:37.602 --> 40:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then bigger payments for the
more -- you
know, for the more desired
videos.

40:41.673 --> 40:45.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Harvey Levin, the
founder of
TMZ, didn't talk to you, right,
for your...

40:45.810 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Correct.

40:47.645 --> 40:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But when he has
talked about
this, he sounds unapologetic
about the...

40:50.181 --> 40:52.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:52.116 --> 40:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Fully. He
says -- the video
is the video, is what he says.
And if we paid

40:54.052 --> 40:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money for the video, so be it.

40:56.321 --> 41:00.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paying for information is a
condemned practice
in journalism, because the
notion is that

41:00.858 --> 41:05.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you are influencing the source
-- you're influencing
why sources are giving you
certain information

41:05.863 --> 41:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they know they're being paid
for it.

41:07.732 --> 41:13.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's saying that we don't
actually pay
for information. We pay for
product. We pay

41:13.204 --> 41:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for -- you know, we're licensing
product,
and that's what we're paying
for.

41:15.673 --> 41:19.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, if they
were just
doing celebrity journalism, I
don't think

41:19.711 --> 41:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you would write about them. I
don't think
we would be talking about them.

41:21.546 --> 41:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Absolutely.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We're talking
about them because
they have done some
consequential stories,

41:25.350 --> 41:30.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
right, that have had some
impact, whether
it's Ray Rice, in the case of
the NFL story

41:30.755 --> 41:34.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a bank getting a bailout
that has -- that
then spent a lot of money on a
party.

41:34.859 --> 41:36.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Right.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Somehow, they
have crossed
over into having some kind of
impact.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Right. Donald
Sterling,
the former Los Angeles Clippers
owner, who...

41:41.332 --> 41:43.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

41:43.301 --> 41:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: And that was
-- this -- the
idea for the story was conceived
in the aftermath

41:47.839 --> 41:51.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the second Ray Rice video
that TMZ posted
in which it showed him knocking
out his then

41:52.076 --> 41:53.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fiancee.

41:53.945 --> 41:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TMZ was punching -- no pun
intended, but sort
of punching above its weight and
publishing

41:58.683 --> 42:02.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
some -- posting some very
consequential stories,
and...

42:02.220 --> 42:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So that the NFL
in that case
had to pay attention.

42:05.890 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: And doing it
and finding
video in ways that other media
organizations

42:08.693 --> 42:10.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weren't.

42:10.528 --> 42:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so -- and that, I think, was
the reason
that we took this project on.
What is TMZ?

42:14.532 --> 42:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do they do what they do?
And, you know,
I was just fascinated trying to
sort of figure

42:18.669 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out how the operation works.

42:20.571 --> 42:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how much do
you think this
has changed the way that
celebrity journalism

42:23.608 --> 42:25.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works?

42:25.576 --> 42:30.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: I think that
it's changed
the way that celebrities respond
to the journalism

42:30.148 --> 42:31.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's being done about them.

42:32.049 --> 42:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think that -- I think
that there
is a sense of -- the sense of
immunity that

42:35.820 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you, if you are a celebrity, you
can sort
of ensconce yourself in
publicists and managers

42:39.991 --> 42:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and be able to kind of navigate
your way around,
and lawyers, and navigate your
way through

42:43.661 --> 42:45.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crises.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that's one
thing Harvey
Levin was acting against, right?

42:46.531 --> 42:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Absolutely.

42:47.999 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The kind of
bubble of control,
he didn't like that.

42:50.535 --> 42:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Absolutely.

42:52.336 --> 42:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's impossible to do
that. If TMZ
has court documents or if they
have video

42:58.509 --> 43:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
footage or audio recordings of
you speaking
to your mistress and making sort
of racist

43:03.514 --> 43:07.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comments about spectators at
your basketball
games, it's just -- you can't
avoid it. You

43:07.652 --> 43:09.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can't sidestep it.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the larger
question is
how much, if at all, has it
impacted more

43:12.290 --> 43:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traditional journalism? In other
words, how
much has their success and the
tactics that

43:17.261 --> 43:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they use had a larger influence?

43:18.729 --> 43:20.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Yes. No,
that's a great
question.

43:20.631 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that -- look, people go
to TMZ because
they want to see. They don't
want to hear

43:25.903 --> 43:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about three sources in a hotel
who say, we
saw Ray Rice step into the
elevator. We don't

43:31.843 --> 43:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what happened next, but we
saw him drag
his wife out. They don't want to
read that.

43:34.812 --> 43:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to watch the video.
And so I think
that -- you know, you're right.
It's a good

43:38.883 --> 43:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point that what readers want to
see is the
sort of -- they want to see
documents. They

43:43.087 --> 43:47.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to see sort of the raw
footage. And I
think that there probably is a
drift towards

43:47.758 --> 43:49.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

43:49.694 --> 43:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you,
finally, did
you come away wary or mortified
or impressed?

43:53.898 --> 43:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was your own feeling,
having looked into
it?

43:56.834 --> 43:58.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Yes.

43:58.803 --> 44:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I came away thinking a
note of admiration
for the way that they have wired
Los Angeles.

44:03.574 --> 44:07.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if there was no money
changing hands
and they had people at Delta and
at these

44:07.745 --> 44:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limo companies and all these
various places
giving information, and their
beat...

44:11.349 --> 44:13.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because they do,
right? Yes.
Yes.

44:13.184 --> 44:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: And TMZ's --
if TMZ's beat
was to cover celebrity news, and
they had

44:15.286 --> 44:19.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all this information coming in,
I would -- there
is no way that you couldn't not
tip your hat.

44:19.257 --> 44:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that there is money
changing hands
does sort of bring about a cloud
of controversy

44:24.962 --> 44:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how they're doing it. But
you have to
hand it to them. They -- what
they do, they

44:28.466 --> 44:29.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do very well.

44:29.867 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
article is "The
Digital Dirt."

44:31.903 --> 44:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nicholas Schmidle, thanks so
much.

44:34.372 --> 44:44.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICHOLAS SCHMIDLE: Thanks for
having me on.

44:44.181 --> 44:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the Super Bowl
came to a
close less than two weeks ago,
quarterback

44:50.788 --> 44:55.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peyton Manning seemed to be
heading toward
a storybook ending to his long
career, as

44:55.927 --> 44:58.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his Denver Broncos won the big
game.

44:58.462 --> 45:04.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But right around the same time,
old allegations
were raised anew, and with a
much higher profile

45:04.635 --> 45:10.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this time, about whether Manning
may have
committed a sexual assault
during his college

45:10.274 --> 45:12.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
career.

45:12.176 --> 45:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manning has long denied it, but
he and his
alma mater, the University of
Tennessee, are

45:16.213 --> 45:17.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under new scrutiny.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

45:19.684 --> 45:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The allegation
against Manning
is that, in 1996, while a female
associate

45:24.255 --> 45:29.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trainer was examining his foot
for an injury,
he dropped his shorts and sat on
her head

45:29.126 --> 45:34.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and face. Manning denied this in
a memoir
he released, saying he was only
mooning a

45:34.332 --> 45:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
male athlete, and the trainer
simply was nearby.

45:37.902 --> 45:42.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But a recent column and
investigation in The
New York Daily News raised this
again. The

45:42.907 --> 45:48.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
article also published court
documents from
a 2003 defamation lawsuit
against Manning.

45:48.346 --> 45:53.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Manning is named in a new
lawsuit that
says the University of Tennessee
has fostered

45:53.250 --> 45:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a culture that enables sexual
assaults by
student athletes.

45:57.888 --> 46:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christine Brennan is a sports
columnist for
USA Today and a commentator for
ABC News who

46:01.592 --> 46:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrote about Manning's history in
2003 and
again this week. She joins me
tonight from

46:07.198 --> 46:08.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Atlanta.

46:09.033 --> 46:12.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Christine, is this now
coming up again
because just a couple of weeks
ago, there

46:12.637 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were 100 hungry reporters
covering the Super
Bowl, putting Peyton Manning and
everybody

46:16.941 --> 46:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else under the microscope?

46:18.342 --> 46:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
It's a fascinating
story, Hari.

46:20.244 --> 46:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it really, I think, speaks
to the power
of social media. Of course, back
in 2003,

46:25.516 --> 46:29.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when I wrote about this, and USA
Today did
cover this story, there was no
Twitter, there

46:29.520 --> 46:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was no Facebook. And, literally,
an ember
becomes a wildfire in a matter
of a couple

46:34.125 --> 46:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hours on a Saturday afternoon.
That's what
happened with this story.

46:38.796 --> 46:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There certainly is the component
of the Cam
Newton story and then the
backlash about people

46:43.100 --> 46:48.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticizing him. Now The New
York Daily News
dredges up and looks at the news
about Peyton

46:48.773 --> 46:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manning, and here we are again,
a 20-year-old
story now back in the news, a
fascinating

46:53.978 --> 46:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalistic look and how things
can happen
in our social media world, and
also, I think,

47:00.084 --> 47:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a look at a powerful, very
popular family,
the first family of football,
the Mannings,

47:05.556 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and how they have perhaps
engineered news
over the years, and now a story
that they

47:09.960 --> 47:11.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cannot control.

47:11.762 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Cam Newton
story was
about the allegation that he
stole a laptop

47:15.066 --> 47:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years and years ago, right?

47:17.001 --> 47:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, besides the social media
effect, did
this first family of football
try to suppress

47:21.939 --> 47:29.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this or smear the person who
made these allegations?
What was the history? And why is
that so important

47:29.613 --> 47:31.415 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

47:31.515 --> 47:34.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Not with me.
I never had
any contact with the Manning
family, never

47:34.652 --> 47:36.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heard from them.

47:36.620 --> 47:38.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, if I had heard
from anyone
saying, don't write this, I
would have redoubled

47:38.889 --> 47:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my efforts as a journalist to
work on the
story and write it. That would
be the way

47:42.760 --> 47:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was trained, and that's my
sense of journalism.

47:45.563 --> 47:50.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I understand, in one case,
ESPN Radio
host Paul Finebaum told me
yesterday on the

47:50.968 --> 47:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
record that he received phone
calls from Archie
Manning, or at least one phone
call, when

47:55.072 --> 47:57.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he was a columnist in
Birmingham, Alabama.

47:57.775 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Archie Manning, this great
star from
the Southeastern Conference,
calls you, and

48:02.847 --> 48:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're in Birmingham, Alabama,
and says, please
don't write the story back in
the '90s, and

48:07.585 --> 48:11.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the Manning family, Paul
Finebaum said
he's a little embarrassed now,
but he said

48:11.255 --> 48:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he didn't write it, because he
understood
that that was a big thing.

48:15.526 --> 48:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's a big part of it.
And I also
think the fact is, you have got
a lot of small

48:18.896 --> 48:23.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
towns in the Southeastern
Conference, around
the country. People love their
college football.

48:23.367 --> 48:27.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wish I could say that
journalism would
trump that, but that's not
always the case.

48:27.104 --> 48:29.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

48:29.140 --> 48:32.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Peyton Manning has not
responded to this
most recent wave of accusations
or this resurfacing

48:32.910 --> 48:37.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these accusations. Is there a
consequence
to this, because you turn on a
TV these days,

48:37.481 --> 48:39.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he's selling just about
everything?

48:39.383 --> 48:43.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, and in
one case,
UltraViolet, a women's rights
group, has called

48:43.387 --> 48:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on at least two of the sponsors
to say drop
him and cut ties -- business
ties.

48:48.459 --> 48:51.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know. It's hard to -- I
think it's
important as journalists, Hari,
to say what

48:51.595 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we know and say what we don't
know. I do not
know what the future holds for
Peyton Manning.

48:55.699 --> 49:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I certainly know this is not the
way he wanted
to exit the NFL, if, in fact,
he's retiring.

49:01.405 --> 49:02.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the last thing he
wanted...

49:02.740 --> 49:04.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure.

49:04.608 --> 49:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: ... because
his legacy
today, his reputation today is
more tarnished

49:06.677 --> 49:08.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than it has ever been.

49:08.579 --> 49:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for the future, I think
there is certainly
a chance he can rehabilitate
himself. But

49:11.749 --> 49:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he's going to retire, he's
going to have
to meet the press, and he's
going to have

49:15.486 --> 49:17.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to answer some of these
questions.

49:17.354 --> 49:19.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
bit about the
Title IX investigation that was
happening

49:19.290 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the University of Tennessee.
I mentioned
it briefly. But that's a bigger
case than

49:23.260 --> 49:24.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just Peyton Manning.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh, it is,
yes.

49:26.430 --> 49:31.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last summer, there were 124
schools that were
under investigation from the
Education Department

49:31.402 --> 49:37.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on issues of sexual harassment
and sexual
assault. Were they doing enough
to find these

49:37.341 --> 49:40.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things out and to deal with
them, 124 universities?

49:40.444 --> 49:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the University of Tennessee
is not alone.
And people might remember that I
think the

49:44.949 --> 49:49.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most famous one has been the
Florida State
story with Jameis Winston, the
Heisman Trophy

49:49.220 --> 49:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
winner a couple of years ago.

49:51.088 --> 49:55.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a problem throughout
our country,
the fact that our universities
do not seem

49:55.259 --> 50:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have a grasp on how to look
at sexual assault,
deal with it, adjudicate it. And
that's what

50:03.133 --> 50:06.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the Tennessee story, and
that's where they
have cited Peyton Manning in
this case.

HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Christine Brennan
from USA Today joining us from
Atlanta today,

50:11.775 --> 50:14.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you.

50:14.345 --> 50:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Thank you,
Hari.

50:20.751 --> 50:28.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, we turn to
our series
Brief But Spectacular, where we
talk with

50:28.459 --> 50:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interesting people about their
passions.

50:30.661 --> 50:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from playwright
and performer
Danai Gurira. Her latest play
"Eclipsed" opens

50:37.101 --> 50:43.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Broadway next week. And you
may also recognize
her from her starring role in
AMC's "The Walking

50:43.274 --> 50:44.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dead."

50:45.075 --> 50:48.345 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
DANAI GURIRA,
Actress/Playwright: I want women
and girls of African descent and
of color

50:48.445 --> 50:58.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to not have to keep
searching for
stories about themselves.

50:58.656 --> 51:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I couldn't find any monologues
and stories
and plays that I really felt I
could take

51:04.428 --> 51:08.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and work with. And I find much
connection
in Shaw and Ibsen and Chekhov,
but if you

51:08.832 --> 51:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are constantly, only dealing
with stories
that are not of the people that
you're from,

51:15.139 --> 51:19.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not from where you're from, not
from your
heritage, that can function as a
disadvantage.

51:19.443 --> 51:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went to grad school because I
wanted to
learn the rules, so I would know
how to break

51:23.047 --> 51:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. Breaking the rules is
saying, I'm breaking
in, OK? I'm breaking in your
very comfortable

51:28.252 --> 51:30.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little house over here, and I'm
going to take
a room.

51:30.487 --> 51:36.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I wrote a play called
"Eclipsed." It grapples
with the experience of five
different women

51:36.360 --> 51:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the war zone of Liberia in
2003, three
women who have been abducted at
different

51:42.666 --> 51:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stages of their lives and become
the forced
"bush wives" -- quote, unquote
-- sex slaves

51:49.006 --> 51:50.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a commanding officer.

51:50.941 --> 51:57.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an astounding cast. Lupita
Nyong'o is
in it, as well as Pascale
Armand, Akosua Busia,

51:57.748 --> 52:01.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Zainab Jah, also the wonderful
Saycon Sengbloh.

52:01.885 --> 52:08.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe.
And I had a
pretty idyllic childhood. I felt
that I was

52:08.258 --> 52:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of this outspoken girl, I
was considered.
I was a girl who talked a lot
and didn't think

52:13.664 --> 52:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my voice had any less value than
anyone around
me. Apparently, that was
strange.

52:18.035 --> 52:24.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moving here really did strike in
me the desire
to tell the African story on
African soil.

52:24.641 --> 52:30.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stories about Africans
always somehow
miraculously had a Western
protagonist. And

52:30.280 --> 52:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was, like, wow, do we not
merit our own
ability to tell our own stories?

52:36.053 --> 52:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I started to write plays
that literally
was like, if you come into this
theater, you

52:40.691 --> 52:45.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to sit down and you're
going to
spend two hours or so with an
African woman

52:46.063 --> 52:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you're going to get to know
her. You are
going to see a full person, just
like you

52:49.266 --> 52:51.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see when you go watch all them
other things.

52:51.935 --> 52:58.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I often feel like a nutty
professor, like
I'm going to try this experiment
and see if

52:58.776 --> 53:05.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it works. My hypothesis is,
people in the
West can absorb African women
stories without

53:05.749 --> 53:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any shaken or stirred mixer. It
can come directly
from the source.

53:11.822 --> 53:16.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I create, so that you can see
women like this
shine and get to do their thang!

53:16.627 --> 53:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Danai Gurira. And
this is my Brief
But Spectacular take on creating
complex stories

53:23.000 --> 53:24.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for unheard voices.

53:24.902 --> 53:29.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
other episodes
of our Brief But Spectacular
series on our

53:29.840 --> 53:33.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Facebook page. That's
Facebook.com/NewsHour.

53:34.078 --> 53:38.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: Three
new studies
released today dig deeper into
what makes

53:38.715 --> 53:44.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
breast milk nutritious,
revealing the baby
has a key role to play. Special
sugars in

53:44.588 --> 53:49.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the milk and certain microbes in
the infant's
gut form a tag team that spur
healthy growth

53:50.094 --> 53:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a child. You can read more
about these
studies on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:56.500 --> 54:01.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tune in later tonight. On
"Charlie Rose,"
author Roger Angell looks at a
writer's life.

54:01.905 --> 54:04.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

54:04.174 --> 54:08.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
David Brooks.

54:08.912 --> 54:18.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
