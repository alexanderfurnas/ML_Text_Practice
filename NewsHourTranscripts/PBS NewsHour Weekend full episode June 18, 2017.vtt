TRUMP'S ELECTION, MAR-A-LAGO

DOUBLED ITS INITIATION FEE TO

04:07.333 --> 04:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$200,000.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION EARNED 20

04:11.066 --> 04:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILLION DOLLARS IN INCOME

04:12.066 --> 04:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATED TO ITS WASHINGTON, D.C.

FROM THE TRUMP TOWER IN KOLKATA,

INDIA.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ALSO REPORTED $5 MILLION FROM

04:22.533 --> 04:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR MORE ANALYSIS OF THESE

04:26.866 --> 04:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCIAL REVELATIONS, I AM

04:27.566 --> 04:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINED BY "WASHINGTON POST"

04:28.766 --> 04:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTER AMY BRITTAIN.

04:29.666 --> 04:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM

04:30.700 --> 04:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS?

04:31.666 --> 04:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE BIG TAKEAWAY IN

04:33.400 --> 04:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT THE FORM IS THAT THIS

04:34.933 --> 04:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS LIKE TRULY AN UNPRECEDENTED

04:36.866 --> 04:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION WITH THE PRESIDENT,

04:38.700 --> 04:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHOOSING TO HOLD ON TO THIS VAST

04:41.533 --> 04:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEALTH, EVEN AS HE'S ENTERED

04:44.066 --> 04:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF YOU LOOK AT HIS FORM, THE

04:48.066 --> 04:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAIN CHANGE IS THAT HE HAS

04:49.866 --> 04:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVED THE MAJORITY OF HIS

04:51.500 --> 04:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS INTO A TRUST, WHICH IS

04:53.766 --> 04:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROLLED BY HIS SONS, DON JR.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ERIC.

04:57.466 --> 04:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TRUST HAS COME UNDER

04:59.333 --> 05:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICISM IN RECENT MONTHS

05:00.766 --> 05:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN REVEALED THAT

05:01.766 --> 05:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCESS TO

05:03.466 --> 05:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TRUST AT ANY TIME.

CHANGES FROM WHAT WAS FILED

05:09.800 --> 05:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE?

05:10.566 --> 05:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IMMEDIATELY CRITICS

05:11.966 --> 05:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE LOOKING AT THE FORMS TO SEE

05:13.600 --> 05:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS HE PROFITING OFF THE OFFICE

05:15.666 --> 05:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PRESIDENCY?

05:17.533 --> 05:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PROFITS FROM

05:19.366 --> 05:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAR-A-LAGO, FROM HIS DIFFERENT

05:20.866 --> 05:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOTELS AROUND THE WORLD AND YOU

05:22.466 --> 05:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN SEE AN INCREASE IN THE

05:24.200 --> 05:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVENUE THAT'S BROUGHT IN MAR-A-

LAGO.

05:26.466 --> 05:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE MOST TELLING IS THE

05:28.833 --> 05:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE HE FILED IN 2015, WHICH WAS

05:30.800 --> 05:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BEGINNING OF HIS CANDIDACY.

05:33.566 --> 05:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN THAT FORM HE REPORTED

05:34.866 --> 05:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT $15 MILLION IN REVENUE

05:37.500 --> 05:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM MAR-A-LAGO FROM THE

PRECEDING PERIOD AND NOW MORE

05:40.500 --> 05:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN $37 MILLION.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BEEN BUYING THEM THROUGH LLCs,

05:54.433 --> 05:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO

05:56.766 --> 05:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE WHO'S PURCHASING THAT,

05:58.400 --> 05:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL OR

05:59.700 --> 06:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> DEFINITELY.

06:03.133 --> 06:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
