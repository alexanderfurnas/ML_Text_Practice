JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.141 --> 00:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: U.S.
stocks wrap up their worst start
to a new year ever, as

00:13.747 --> 00:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the price of oil trades at its
lowest point in over 12 years.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:18.185 --> 00:20.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: I'm not
going to use your mother's birth
against

00:20.687 --> 00:22.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

00:22.723 --> 00:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Following the
first presidential candidate
debate of the new year, we're
here

00:27.027 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks to talk about the race as
we get close to Iowa.

00:32.766 --> 00:38.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Silicon Valley may be the
hot spot for tech jobs, but it
lags when it comes to diversity

00:38.005 --> 00:41.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in hiring. We look at why.

00:41.675 --> 00:47.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: A new PBS drama, "Mercy
Street," described as "Gone With
the Wind" meets "MASH," focuses

00:47.481 --> 00:50.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on medics during the Civil War.

00:50.751 --> 00:54.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH RADNOR, Actor: There's this
feeling that it's entirely
grounded in its time and place,

00:54.688 --> 00:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, at the same time, it feels
modern and urgent and vital.

00:59.192 --> 01:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:06.033 --> 01:10.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.537 --> 01:20.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The first two
weeks of 2016 will go down in
Wall Street history for the

01:20.681 --> 01:26.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biggest losses to begin a year.
Stocks plunged again today, as
oil prices fell below $30

01:26.320 --> 01:28.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a barrel.

01:28.622 --> 01:36.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost more than 390 points to
close below 15990. The

01:36.196 --> 01:44.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nasdaq fell 126 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 dropped 41. Since the
year began, the Dow and the

01:44.171 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
S&amp;P are down 8 percent. The
Nasdaq is off 10 percent. We
will get a full report and

01:48.642 --> 01:52.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
analysis after the news summary.

01:52.913 --> 01:59.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration has
ordered a nationwide pause on
issuing new coal leases on
federal

01:59.553 --> 02:04.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
land. That's while the
Department of the Interior
reviews whether coal companies
are paying

02:04.558 --> 02:09.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough in royalties to the
government and what the
environmental effects of mining
are.

02:09.763 --> 02:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roughly 40 percent of the coal
produced in the United States is
mined on federal lands.

02:15.535 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel faces
new protests today over the
fatal shootings of black
suspects

02:21.541 --> 02:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by police. Demonstrators turned
out at an annual Martin Luther
King Jr. breakfast with

02:27.314 --> 02:31.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mayor. Dozens of black
ministers boycotted the event,
but Emanuel pledged to address

02:31.852 --> 02:33.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their concerns.

02:33.887 --> 02:40.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: We also have to root
out the cancer of police abuse,

02:40.861 --> 02:50.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the quest for safe and
secure neighborhoods and against
violence demands trust between

02:50.337 --> 02:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the community and the police.
And when there is no trust,
there is no safety.

02:55.475 --> 03:00.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There've been
charges of a cover-up in the
death of teenager Laquan
McDonald,

03:00.614 --> 03:07.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was shot 16 times by a white
officer in 2014. Video of the
shooting was withheld until

03:07.988 --> 03:12.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last November. Yesterday,
officials released footage of
the killing of a carjacking
suspect

03:12.092 --> 03:16.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2013.

03:16.196 --> 03:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coast Guard crews in Hawaii
spent this day searching for
survivors after two U.S. Marine

03:21.835 --> 03:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helicopters collided and crashed
at sea overnight. They carried
12 people on a night training

03:28.508 --> 03:35.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mission off Oahu. An aerial
search began before first light
and crews spotted a debris field

03:35.549 --> 03:42.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spread across two miles of
choppy seas. There's no word on
the cause of the crash.

03:42.489 --> 03:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. children's fund UNICEF
painted a desperate picture
today of starvation in Syria.

03:49.296 --> 03:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two relief convoys reached the
town of Madaya this week after a
long siege by Syrian government

03:56.436 --> 04:01.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces. U.N. workers found
severe malnutrition among
children and local officials
told of

04:01.675 --> 04:06.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
32 people starving to
death in the past month.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lindsey Hilsum of Independent
Television News filed this
report.

04:09.983 --> 04:16.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: Some food and
medicine is now getting to
Madaya and two towns besieged

04:16.423 --> 04:19.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the rebels.

04:19.693 --> 04:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a mobile clinic was
allowed in. The health center is
full of people seeking
treatment.

04:26.500 --> 04:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her 15-year-old son needs to go
to hospital in Damascus, but,
despite the urgency, the

04:34.207 --> 04:40.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Red Crescent and the U.N.
haven't yet managed to negotiate
to get people out.

04:40.380 --> 04:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moadamiya, less than six miles
from the center of Damascus,
hasn't had the same attention

04:46.319 --> 04:58.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Madaya. But maybe it should.
She's getting the telltale signs
of malnutrition. Her mother

04:58.198 --> 05:01.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pulls back her towel and jacket.

05:01.468 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"There's no milk for children,"
she says. "Look, her hands are
getting thinner."

05:08.141 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. says 450,000 Syrians
are living under siege across
the country. Moadamiya is held

05:16.316 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by rebels who the Syrian
government is trying to starve
into submission.

05:20.987 --> 05:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
regime bombarded the roads into
our town. We're under siege.

05:27.427 --> 05:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The road's been closed for 20
days now. There's no food or
medicine.

05:32.299 --> 05:38.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY HILSUM: Today, the
Russians dropped humanitarian
aid on Deir el-Zour, a town held

05:38.805 --> 05:45.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Syrian government and
besieged by the Islamic State.
At the same time, Russian
aircraft

05:45.979 --> 05:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continued to drop bombs on
rebel-held parts of Aleppo, and
Syrian children continue to

05:52.752 --> 05:56.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
live with the fear
of hunger and death.

05:56.022 --> 06:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Western nations
called an emergency meeting of
the U.N. Security Council today

06:00.760 --> 06:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to demand the warring parties
in Syria end the sieges.

06:06.132 --> 06:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police in Indonesia now say the
suicide attack in Jakarta that
killed two civilians was indeed

06:12.505 --> 06:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funded by the Islamic State
group. Five of the attackers
died in the assault yesterday.

06:18.044 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overnight, anti-terror officers
arrested several people just
outside Jakarta. It was unclear

06:24.084 --> 06:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they're directly linked to
the bombings, but the national
police chief promised more

06:27.988 --> 06:30.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arrests.

06:30.457 --> 06:35.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): For
sure, there were people who
helped in the attack, including

06:35.262 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those who facilitated the buying
of materials, people who
assembled the bombs and so on.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are involved in the attack,
so I ordered they be tracked
down and arrested, all the

06:43.303 --> 06:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people involved in the attack,
including its network.

06:46.473 --> 06:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately today,
Indonesian President Joko Widodo
visited the site of

06:51.745 --> 06:57.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the attack and talked to
business owners. He said
everything is back to normal.

06:57.784 --> 07:03.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Somalia, the Islamist
militant group Al-Shabaab claims
that it overran an African Union
base

07:03.790 --> 07:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today and killed at least 63
Kenyan soldiers. It happened in
Southwestern Somalia near the

07:10.697 --> 07:15.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border with Kenya. Witnesses
confirmed the militants took
over the site. Kenya's president

07:15.702 --> 07:20.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
acknowledged casualties,
but gave no numbers.

07:20.373 --> 07:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. human rights chief
warned today that Burundi is
sliding toward a new ethnic
conflict

07:26.079 --> 07:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between Tutsis and Hutus. He
accused government security
forces of gang rape, torture and

07:31.584 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
mass killings of
political opponents.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Geneva, a spokesman for the
U.N. agency said many of the
victims were members of the

07:38.224 --> 07:40.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tutsi minority.

07:40.527 --> 07:41.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUPERT COLVILLE, Spokesman,
United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights: The suggestion

07:41.761 --> 07:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that an ethnic dimension is now
starting to emerge is reinforced
by one of the sexually

07:47.000 --> 07:53.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abused women, who said that her
abuser told her she was paying
the price for being a Tutsi.

07:53.006 --> 07:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another witness claimed that
Tutsis were systematically
killed, while Hutus were spared,
and the decision

07:58.578 --> 08:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to arrest people was also
reportedly largely made on an
ethnic basis.

08:02.615 --> 08:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Burundi suffered
12 years of civil war that
finally ended in 2005. But

08:08.922 --> 08:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.N. says that 432 people
have been killed in rising
violence just since last April.

08:16.429 --> 08:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And test results confirm that a
new Ebola death in Sierra Leone
has happened. The news

08:21.835 --> 08:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes one day after the World
Health Organization declared the
two-year epidemic in Western

08:26.773 --> 08:32.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Africa was finally over.
Officials say the latest victim
may have exposed at least 27

08:32.078 --> 08:34.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other people.

08:34.781 --> 08:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
dropping oil prices ripple
through the global economy;

08:40.887 --> 08:46.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze the last GOP debate
before Iowa; boosting diversity

08:46.960 --> 09:00.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Silicon Valley; and could
"Mercy Street" became the next
"Downton Abbey"?

09:00.106 --> 09:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now: the market plunge that is
sweeping across stock exchanges
from Asia to Europe to New

09:07.714 --> 09:10.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
York.

09:10.283 --> 09:17.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has been relentless since the
year began, and today was no
different. The closing bell

09:17.157 --> 09:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Wall Street signaled the end
to a turbulent day and a tough
week for markets worldwide.

09:23.863 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fueling the sell orders, another
plunge on China's Shanghai
Composite Stock Index. It's

09:31.004 --> 09:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down 18 percent since the year
began, as worries about the
Chinese economy mount.

09:37.977 --> 09:44.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And plummeting oil prices are
dragging down energy company
stocks and the broader market.

09:44.150 --> 09:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington, White House
spokesman Josh Earnest said U.S.
officials are closely monitoring

09:48.621 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the global sell-off.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: There's no denying
that weakness in other

09:52.926 --> 09:57.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
markets with whom we do
extensive business is going to
be a headwind for the U.S.
economy.

09:57.464 --> 10:02.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're mindful of that,
particularly as the
international economy becomes
more integrated,

10:02.235 --> 10:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we have to be sensitive to
movements that we see in the
economies of other countries.

10:11.845 --> 10:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. market
was also hurt by disappointing
reports on several major

10:17.317 --> 10:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic indicators. Industrial
production fell for a third
straight month in December.

10:24.290 --> 10:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And retail sales unexpectedly
dropped a 10th of a percent last
month, partly because warmer

10:30.196 --> 10:34.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weather hurt winter
clothing sales.

10:34.501 --> 10:39.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For a closer look at the
dramatic drops in both the stock
market and world oil prices,

10:39.539 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we turn to Liz Ann Sonders.
She's chief investment
strategist at Charles Schwab.
And Bradley

10:44.677 --> 10:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Olson, he's national energy
reporter for The Wall Street
Journal.

10:48.414 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both of
you to the program.

10:51.251 --> 10:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Liz Ann Sonders, what is behind
this volatility today in the
market?

10:56.723 --> 10:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZ ANN SONDERS, Charles Schwab:
Many of the same things,
actually, that contributed to

10:59.092 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the volatility that
we saw last year.

11:02.128 --> 11:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have touched on certainly
oil, but it's more broadly
what's happening in the
commodity

11:06.065 --> 11:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complex, and not just the huge
plunge, in and of itself, but
what that says about global

11:11.004 --> 11:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growth. Of course, related to
that is China, the weakness
there, not only in its equity

11:14.841 --> 11:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
market, but its economy, its
currency. That is tied into
commodity prices.

11:19.312 --> 11:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then even more importantly
was the uncertainty regarding
the Fed. We got past the
uncertainty

11:24.884 --> 11:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the defined 2015 in terms of
will they, won't they, and if
they will, when? They got the

11:29.889 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first rate hike. Now it's what
are they going to do from here?
Are they going to continue

11:33.493 --> 11:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to raise interest rates? What
will be the justification?

11:36.162 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of it really is
unfinished business from 2015.
It's just conspired to occur in

11:42.135 --> 11:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a condensed period of time,
unfortunately, right at the
beginning of the year, which

11:44.537 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think adds to the
angst for investors.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Liz Ann Sonders,
staying with you, so is this the
kind of anxiety that's

11:50.843 --> 11:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
justified or is this something
that has just gotten out of hand
in the last few days?

11:56.783 --> 12:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZ ANN SONDERS: It's really
hard to say at this point. I
would love to know where this

12:00.153 --> 12:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
correction stops right here. We
do not think that this is the
beginning of a big, nasty

12:03.523 --> 12:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bear market, but it could get
worse before it gets better.

12:08.461 --> 12:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think investors have been
fairly skittish really for much
of this bull market all along.

12:13.066 --> 12:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you get these bouts of
volatility, particularly if it's
got some fairly dire

12:17.904 --> 12:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news associated with it, we
really hunker down much more
quickly than we have in the

12:22.842 --> 12:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past, because I think we really
changed the psyche of a
generation of investors, not
only

12:28.381 --> 12:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of the severity of the
financial crisis, but the fact
it came within 10 years from

12:32.018 --> 12:34.887 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the bear market
that preceded it.

12:34.887 --> 12:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that explains why we
see this sense of urgency and
sometimes panic kick

12:39.826 --> 12:42.862 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
in so quickly in
this environment.

12:42.862 --> 12:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bradley Olson,
let's talk about the oil side of
this. What is driving this

12:46.633 --> 12:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continued drop in oil prices?

12:49.335 --> 12:53.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRADLEY OLSON, The Wall Street
Journal: Well, there are two
main factors at play.

12:53.072 --> 12:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first one is a little bit
tied to what's driving the
falling stock markets worldwide,

12:57.343 --> 13:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's China. China's sort
of always been the golden goose
when it comes to oil markets,

13:02.348 --> 13:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly with demand.
China's about the second largest
oil consumer in the world,

13:07.053 --> 13:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so whenever there are
indications that the Chinese
economy perhaps isn't going to

13:10.757 --> 13:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be as strong as people had
expected, it causes a great deal
of uncertainty when it comes

13:13.493 --> 13:16.062 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to oil.

13:16.062 --> 13:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second factor is Iran. The
sanctions are about to be lifted
that were imposed by the

13:21.901 --> 13:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States and the European
Union, and once those sanctions
are up, a lot of people

13:26.272 --> 13:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anticipate a significant a
amount of oil coming into the
market from Iran, perhaps as
many

13:29.542 --> 13:33.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this year as 500,000
barrels of oil.

13:33.079 --> 13:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the market is already
oversupplied, and you're going
to dump additional barrels into

13:37.517 --> 13:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the market from Iran. And then
you have problems or questions
about demand that would have

13:42.321 --> 13:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been able to bring up the price.
So, there's just a lot of
indicators that are not positive

13:46.693 --> 13:49.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at this time when it
comes to the oil market.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is it,
though, expected that these
countries are just going to
continue

13:53.399 --> 13:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to pump regardless of how
low the price is going?

13:57.937 --> 14:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRADLEY OLSON: That's right. I
mean, one of the things that you
see happening when the

14:01.541 --> 14:06.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
price goes down is that
everybody's trying to make up
for the lost revenue. And so
this

14:06.679 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something that's actually
happened in the history of oil
crashes, is that all the
producers

14:11.050 --> 14:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and companies actually try to
pump more oil because they're
trying to make up for whatever

14:14.454 --> 14:18.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they have been losing
by producing more.

14:18.191 --> 14:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, a lot of people
expected the U.S. shale
companies and U.S. companies
that

14:22.428 --> 14:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were behind a major boon in
production in the last few years
to slow down, and they

14:26.933 --> 14:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just haven't done that yet. They
have been a lot more resilient
than anybody expected.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Liz Ann Sonders,
you used the word panic a minute
ago. Compare this to what

14:34.140 --> 14:37.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was going on in 2008.

14:37.343 --> 14:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZ ANN SONDERS: Oh, I don't
think this resembles 2008 by any
stretch, when you think about

14:42.515 --> 14:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the proximate cause for that, it
was obviously a seizure of the
financial system which had

14:47.320 --> 14:52.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
global tentacles and the
leverage associated with that.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're seeing now is a
bit more concentrated in the
commodity space. Leverage in the
financial

14:56.362 --> 15:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system is significantly lower
than it was back then. I think
what we're seeing has a

15:01.400 --> 15:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
greater analogy to 1998 than it
does 2008, where you had an
environment where you had

15:07.540 --> 15:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major currency disruptions,
problems in the emerging
markets.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It ultimately caused a
tremendous amount of volatility
and even a very severe
correction

15:16.315 --> 15:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S. stock market, but it
didn't take the financial system
nor the U.S. economy

15:21.821 --> 15:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down with it, and I think that's
the better analogy than 2008.

15:25.224 --> 15:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what does that
mean? You talked about the
psyche of investors and how

15:29.896 --> 15:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's changing, and I think you
mentioned millennials. I mean,
what is different about

15:33.099 --> 15:35.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the psyche of investors today?

15:35.935 --> 15:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZ ANN SONDERS: Well, I think
we're well past certainly the
go-go days of the late

15:40.573 --> 15:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1990s, where there was the cult
of equities and everybody was
enthusiastic about it, it

15:43.810 --> 15:46.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a hobby for many.

15:46.379 --> 15:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You didn't quite build that back
up into 2007. The bubble at that
time was more outside the

15:52.151 --> 15:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stock market, in that it was
concentrated in housing. And
those stocks and homes are

15:57.256 --> 16:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two biggest components of
household net worth, so you have
gotten the hit to both

16:01.494 --> 16:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of those things, which I think
what we have established,
whether it's millennials as
children

16:06.232 --> 16:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the baby boomers or even the
older generation after that, is
not all that different than

16:10.503 --> 16:13.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we saw come out of the
Great Depression, not that this
environment is as extreme as

16:13.005 --> 16:15.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

16:15.508 --> 16:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it really instituted an era
of deleveraging. And I would
call it a smarter investor,
smarter

16:21.547 --> 16:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consumer. They're not spending
the windfall of these lower oil
prices. Some of it's going

16:26.419 --> 16:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to consumption, but some of it
is going to savings and
continued debt pay-down. That's

16:29.755 --> 16:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the kind of psyche change
I think we're seeing.

16:32.491 --> 16:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bradley Olson,
you mentioned previous oil
market crashes. What's the
history

16:39.332 --> 16:42.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when something like this
happens? How does the price of
oil find its bottom before it

16:42.435 --> 16:45.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starts to rise again?

16:45.071 --> 16:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRADLEY OLSON: Well, what we see
-- usually, what they say, and
it's sort of an adage that

16:49.075 --> 16:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exists in the market, is that
low prices cure low prices.

16:53.379 --> 16:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they mean by that is
whenever companies and even
countries, you know, don't spend

16:59.352 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of money, you will see
that follow the oil market about
a year or two years after

17:04.557 --> 17:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they stop spending. And so what
we have seen from the past is
that when you have underspending

17:09.028 --> 17:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a year or two that doesn't
come to the level that they need
to spend to increase

17:14.734 --> 17:18.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
production or to bring
production to replace all the
oil that they have already put
out

17:18.271 --> 17:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the market, whenever you
see that happening, that's when
the price starts to come back

17:20.473 --> 17:22.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

17:22.541 --> 17:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Already, the level of spending
is so low in the past two years,
or it's been reduced so

17:28.214 --> 17:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much in the past two years, that
it's already worse than at any
point in any two-year period

17:32.551 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the 1980s. So you already
have the ability to compare this
downturn and this oil and

17:37.657 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
natural gas crash to the worst
of the periods of the 1980s when
it was also very low.

17:42.762 --> 17:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you have to go all the way
back to the '70s and the Arab
oil embargo to find a time

17:48.134 --> 17:50.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when the crash was
as bad as it is now.

17:50.436 --> 17:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's given
us all a lot to, not just think
about. Maybe we all need

17:54.240 --> 17:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to turn to the history books in
both the markets and the oil
situation.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bradley Olson, Liz Ann
Sonders, we thank you both.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIZ ANN SONDERS: Thanks, Judy.

18:02.148 --> 18:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRADLEY OLSON: Thank you.

18:09.322 --> 18:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
presidential candidates returned
to the campaign trail

18:23.836 --> 18:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today after squaring off last
night on a debate stage in South
Carolina.

18:29.575 --> 18:33.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Front-runners Donald Trump and
Ted Cruz dominated the event,
while the rest of the field
continue

18:33.412 --> 18:35.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to try to keep pace.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"NewsHour" correspondent
William Brangham reports.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: My
friend Donald said that he had
had his

18:41.287 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyers look at this from every
which way, and there was no
issue there.

18:45.591 --> 18:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The issue is
Ted Cruz's eligibility to run
for the presidency. And

18:50.396 --> 18:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald is Donald Trump, who's
been highlighting the fact that
Cruz was born to an American

18:54.400 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother, but in Canada. Early on,
the issue ignited a testy
exchange between the two
candidates

18:58.471 --> 19:01.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leading the Republican
field in Iowa.

19:01.173 --> 19:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I recognize that
Donald is dismayed that his poll
numbers are falling

19:06.612 --> 19:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iowa. But the facts and the
law here are really quite clear.
Under longstanding U.S.

19:12.351 --> 19:18.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law, the child of a U.S. citizen
born abroad is a natural-born
citizen.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Trump, in
turn, insisted the issue would
hang over his rival's head

19:20.292 --> 19:22.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
until it's put to rest.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: And if you become the
nominee, who the hell

19:25.631 --> 19:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knows if you can even serve in
office? So you should go out,
get a declaratory judgment,

19:30.069 --> 19:32.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
let the courts decide.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That set the
tone for a rough-and-tumble
evening, and the candidates

19:35.741 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got into it again over the Texas
senator's statements that Trump
embodies -- quote -- "New

19:39.145 --> 19:41.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
York values."

19:41.747 --> 19:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: And listen, there
are many, many wonderful,
wonderful working men and

19:46.318 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women in the state of New York.
But everyone understands that
the values in New York City

19:53.926 --> 19:59.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are socially liberal or
pro-abortion or
pro-gay-marriage, focus around
money and the media.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Trump answered
that with a spirited defense of
his hometown, harking

20:02.401 --> 20:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back to the days after 9/11.

20:05.738 --> 20:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And we rebuilt
downtown Manhattan, and
everybody in the world watched
and everybody

20:11.444 --> 20:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the world loved New York and
loved New Yorkers. And I have to
tell you, that was

20:14.880 --> 20:17.550 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
a very insulting
statement that Ted made.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

20:19.785 --> 20:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But it wasn't
just a two-man show. Cruz took
aim at Florida Senator Marco

20:23.989 --> 20:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rubio for his involvement in a
2013 immigration reform
compromise.

20:28.794 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: It is also the
case that that Rubio-Schumer
amnesty bill, one of the things

20:35.101 --> 20:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it did is it expanded Barack
Obama's power to let in Syrian
refugees. It enabled hi,

20:41.373 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, to certify them
en masse without mandating
meaningful background checks.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rubio
counterattacked with a charge
that Cruz himself has gone back
and

20:48.247 --> 20:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forth on a number of issues.

20:50.883 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: Ted
Cruz, you used to say you
supported doubling

20:54.386 --> 20:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number of green cards. Now
you say that you're against it.
You used to support a 500

20:59.191 --> 21:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent increase in the number
of guest workers. Now you say
that you're against it.

21:02.661 --> 21:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw you on the Senate floor
flip your vote on crop insurance
because they told you it

21:07.266 --> 21:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would help you in Iowa, and last
week, we all saw you flip your
vote on ethanol in Iowa

21:07.900 --> 21:09.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the same reason.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

21:11.937 --> 21:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rubio also
sought to take down New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie, a

21:16.642 --> 21:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rival for support of the party's
so-called establishment wing, by
painting his record

21:19.912 --> 21:22.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as liberal.

21:22.114 --> 21:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Governor
Christie has endorsed many of
the ideas that Barack Obama
supports,

21:26.418 --> 21:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it is Common Core or gun
control or the appointment of
Sonia Sotomayor or the

21:30.523 --> 21:32.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
donation he made to
Planned Parenthood.

21:32.758 --> 21:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Christie, in
turn, dismissed the jibe as all
politics, and no principle.

21:36.595 --> 21:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate: Two
years ago, he called me a
conservative

21:40.599 --> 21:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reformer that New Jersey needed.
That was before he was running
against me. Now that

21:44.436 --> 21:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he is, he's changed his tune.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Rubio and
Christie saved their toughest
words for the president,
hammering

21:49.475 --> 21:51.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
away all evening.

21:51.944 --> 21:55.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE: Mr.
President, we're not against
you. We're against your
policies.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are going to kick your
rear end out of the White House
come this fall.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

22:00.252 --> 22:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ohio Governor
John Kasich and former Florida
Governor Jeb Bush also

22:03.689 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept most of their fire trained
on the White House. And Bush
emerged today with a
high-profile

22:08.194 --> 22:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorsement from South Carolina
Senator Lindsey Graham, who
recently gave up his own
presidential

22:12.097 --> 22:16.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bid. The South Carolina
primary is February 20.

22:16.001 --> 22:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, though, the Republicans
enter the home stretch in Iowa
and New Hampshire. Their next

22:20.639 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate will be in Iowa on
January 28, the Thursday before
the caucuses.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that
backdrop, it's the perfect time
to turn to the analysis of

22:31.250 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Shields and Brooks.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and New York Times
columnist David Brooks.

22:36.255 --> 22:36.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

22:38.557 --> 22:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, what do
you make of that debate last
night?

22:42.027 --> 22:47.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Trump, Cruz, I
think that no question about it.

22:47.399 --> 22:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, more than anything
else, what I got was a sense of
how dominant Donald Trump has

22:52.905 --> 22:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in setting the terms of the
debate in both parties in 2016.
I mean, candidates in

22:59.011 --> 23:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both parties -- maybe not Bernie
Sanders, but virtually everybody
else -- is responding

23:03.249 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to or reacting to.

23:05.884 --> 23:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we saw Marco Rubio doing
sort of a feisty, aggressive,
not a knock-off Donald

23:14.093 --> 23:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, but sort of a variation
of it -- that and Ted Cruz's
first unforced error of the

23:20.933 --> 23:23.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
season by his New York,
New York. He gave...

23:23.135 --> 23:23.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(COUGHING)

23:23.569 --> 23:26.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Pardon me.

23:26.238 --> 23:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave Trump -- I apologize --
a great opening, which he took
advantage of.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why don't
you take a sip of water?

23:33.212 --> 23:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And let me turn to David.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have the same
impression from...

23:37.783 --> 23:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm sort of
cross-pressured on that. I'm an
American citizen born in Canada,

23:40.686 --> 23:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Cruz, but I'm from New
York, so I have got New York
values.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:42.888 --> 23:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: So, I don't
know who to dislike more.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:48.494 --> 23:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But it is a
Cruz-Trump show right now. And,
to me, the paradox is that

23:55.034 --> 23:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought Cruz won the debate,
just had better debating points.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You did? You did?

23:58.637 --> 24:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought he was
-- on some of the stuff, on the
birther stuff, I thought

24:01.507 --> 24:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's just more forceful. He's
more skillful as a debater.

24:04.610 --> 24:13.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, as Mark said, Trump
dominates the discussion, and so
he's the central figure. Cruz
may beat

24:13.319 --> 24:17.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, but Trump is still the
story. And if you're looking for
a strong leader, which

24:17.923 --> 24:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apparently -- the Republican
Party apparently is, well, Trump
is still the main arena. And

24:22.795 --> 24:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so he can afford to lose a
debate and still come out ahead.
And that's where I think we

24:25.097 --> 24:26.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are right now.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, where is
that -- where does that
translate into, though, Mark?
Where

24:29.835 --> 24:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does that leave this race? Does
it mean it's down to Donald
Trump and Ted Cruz?

24:34.540 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, all the
numbers in Iowa suggests it's
the two of them, and with Marco

24:38.344 --> 24:44.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rubio nipping at the heels and
Ben Carson sort of fading in
fourth or somewhere.

24:44.350 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As an example of Trump, let me
just give you what I thought was
-- it was a brilliant
formulation

24:49.755 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he did on the birther issue. He
did the birther issue against
President Obama, you will
recall.

24:54.893 --> 24:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had his people in Hawaii who
had uncovered all of this
information, which turned out

24:59.498 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be totally bogus, as so much
of the charges and allegations
always have been.

25:05.604 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what he did with Cruz was --
on the birther issue wasn't that
he was born in Calgary,

25:12.778 --> 25:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Alberta, Canada, but that
he's putting the party at risk
by opening himself up to

25:18.283 --> 25:20.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a legal suit. And...

25:20.452 --> 25:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, if I made
him my vice presidential...

25:22.187 --> 25:23.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:23.122 --> 25:25.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, even if I
made him my vice president.

25:25.791 --> 25:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all of a sudden, he puts
Cruz on the defensive of trying
to prove a negative. It really
is

25:30.596 --> 25:33.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
-- it's shrewd.

25:33.532 --> 25:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, Judy, I do
want to give a shout-out, quite
bluntly, to Jeb Bush. He

25:38.804 --> 25:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
demonstrated character. He's
demonstrated character on the
issue. And the Republicans,

25:45.911 --> 25:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a man, without Jeb Bush and
without Lindsey Graham no longer
in the race, and with the

25:52.384 --> 25:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible exception of John
Kasich, quite frankly, but they
were anti-Muslim.

25:56.121 --> 26:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, they were bigoted and
narrow-minded and intolerant.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When they were
asked, would you keep Muslims
out of the country?

26:05.531 --> 26:07.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

26:07.433 --> 26:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And Jeb Bush
pointed out, well, you are
talking about Indonesia, you are
talking

26:10.769 --> 26:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about India, you are talking
about the Kurds, you are talking
about our friends. I mean,

26:14.440 --> 26:17.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is an absolutely
irrational policy.

26:17.509 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, but he stood
alone, with the possible
exception of Kasich.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, does that
mean something, though, for Jeb
Bush? Does it -- does that

26:27.719 --> 26:30.022 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
translate into
something for him?

26:30.022 --> 26:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, Jeb Bush is
part of a large group of people
who are like the team

26:33.325 --> 26:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at halftime who -- like the
Republican establishment, who
feel like they're down 50 points
and they

26:37.029 --> 26:39.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have decided they're
going to lose the game.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's how the Republican
establishment is right now. They
don't believe that Ted

26:43.735 --> 26:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz or Donald Trump can win.
They think it could imperil
their majorities in Congress,

26:47.206 --> 26:48.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and yet they're doing
nothing about it.

26:48.841 --> 26:51.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
what could they do?

26:51.643 --> 26:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I wish we
had gray men in suits. We don't
have that.

26:55.981 --> 27:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the donor class could do
something. Frankly, the country
is filled with state legislators

27:00.953 --> 27:08.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are Republicans,
congressmen, senators, local
committeemen, a lot of whom are
in panic.

27:08.660 --> 27:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so maybe they should do
something about it. Maybe they
should have a MoveOn.org-type

27:13.832 --> 27:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organization and get some
rallying, which the other side
has already done, and have

27:18.237 --> 27:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a counterweight, so they don't
send the party into suicide.

27:21.039 --> 27:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that might involve, not now,
but after New Hampshire,
winnowing the field, and donors

27:26.645 --> 27:30.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other people going and
saying, we're just going to pick
this guy. We're going to pick

27:30.649 --> 27:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rubio. I'm sorry, Jeb, you're
not going to be president.
Christie, you can be secretary

27:35.020 --> 27:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of treasury, but we're going to
get organized here and we're not
going to go quietly into

27:37.356 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the night.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, go back to
some kind of smoke-filled room?
I mean, is that...

27:40.926 --> 27:42.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm
pro-conspiracy right now.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:43.395 --> 27:46.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: You think
it's that critical?

27:46.598 --> 27:50.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, you know,
I'm sort of -- I have no
confidence in my judgment. I

27:50.168 --> 27:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shouldn't say that on TV.

27:51.370 --> 27:51.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:51.870 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Because...

27:53.739 --> 27:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark and I have
confidence in your judgment.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Because I thought
Trump would fade. And I still
sort of think he will fade.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's not looking...

28:02.414 --> 28:04.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sort of?
You have backed...

28:04.249 --> 28:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I mean, it's --
right now, Trump and Cruz are
both looking pretty good. And

28:09.688 --> 28:13.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't think either is
electable, and neither do a lot
of Republicans. And so the
question

28:13.325 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is, why do they just sit
there and do nothing?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, but, I
mean, that -- Mark, again, that
raises the question. What about

28:18.864 --> 28:24.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these other candidates? There is
Rubio, there's Christie, there's
Jeb Bush, there's John Kasich.

28:24.069 --> 28:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are they having so much
difficulty rising and getting
critical mass?

28:30.142 --> 28:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think they're
having sleepless nights trying
to figure it out, Judy.

28:34.746 --> 28:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, John Kasich insists on
mentioning in every sentence
that he served 18 years

28:40.152 --> 28:44.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the House of Representatives,
which is a disqualification in
the current climate.

28:44.590 --> 28:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you have spent more than two
high school tours in Washington,
that makes you morally

28:48.493 --> 28:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
suspect to these primary voters.

28:53.231 --> 28:59.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeb Bush, 75 percent of
Republicans said as recently as
last June that they could vote

28:59.371 --> 29:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Jeb Bush, see themselves
voting for Jeb Bush for
president in November. That's
down

29:03.475 --> 29:07.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the same Wall Street
Journal/NBC poll out last night
to 42 percent.

29:07.112 --> 29:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some reason, you know,
they're visiting a wrath that
they feel toward his brother.

29:13.752 --> 29:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, remember, the Tea Party
was spawned at some degree in
reaction to what they felt

29:21.493 --> 29:27.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
had been the -- not the
perfidiousness, but certainly
the breaking with the
conservative

29:27.332 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compact of the Bush years on
immigration, on spending, on any
number of issues.

29:34.906 --> 29:39.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with the others, Christie is
running a one-state campaign. I
mean, he's running in

29:39.578 --> 29:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Hampshire. If he were to do
well, I don't know where he goes
from there.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because
he has to do well there.

29:44.616 --> 29:48.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He has
to do well there.

29:48.053 --> 29:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's -- Rubio is -- you
know, Rubio is everybody's
second choice. But he's got

29:52.724 --> 29:56.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to have a victory. And I
don't know where that is.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And I'm not sure
he's taking the right tack by
trying to be Ted Cruz-lite.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He's darkened his
tone. He's gone on the attack on
immigration and all

30:02.634 --> 30:04.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the other stuff.

30:04.836 --> 30:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to me, you want to be the
alternative. You don't want --
if you -- if people want

30:07.139 --> 30:08.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Cruz mood, they are
going to vote for Ted Cruz.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: That's
exactly right.

30:09.941 --> 30:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And then Mark has
made this point about other
campaigns.

30:14.112 --> 30:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When A and B attack each other,
sometimes, C benefits. But if
it's C, D, E, F, and G,

30:20.285 --> 30:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not going to benefit. So
they got to have a C. And so I
think a lot is going to

30:25.891 --> 30:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen. Iowa and New Hampshire,
I do not think are going to
decide this thing. We are going

30:28.760 --> 30:32.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go through a lot of states.
So, a lot can happen down the
road.

30:32.497 --> 30:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, somehow, somebody has got
to take some initiative if it's
not going to be Ted Cruz.

30:37.102 --> 30:40.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, meanwhile,
over on the Democratic side, the
Hillary Clinton camp

30:40.906 --> 30:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is feeling some anxiety, Mark,
over Bernie Sanders, who's doing
better in Iowa, has been

30:47.045 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing well in New Hampshire.

30:51.316 --> 30:55.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen a really
interesting back and forth, I
mean, her camp going after
Sanders

30:55.153 --> 30:57.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this week in a way
they weren't before.

30:57.355 --> 31:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. It was kind
of good old Bernie, until he
became a threat. As Bernie

31:01.460 --> 31:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rose in the polls, he became a
more formidable adversary, but
also a more menacing adversary.

31:09.201 --> 31:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Clinton campaign this week,
in perhaps the stupidest act of
the entire year, took

31:18.009 --> 31:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the one person who's a character
witness, who is a privileged
observer of Hillary Clinton,

31:24.883 --> 31:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who can testify about Hillary
Clinton as a human being, as a
mother, as a grandmother,

31:30.055 --> 31:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as somebody who's always been
there, who's been a force for
decency in her life, who's

31:35.293 --> 31:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taught her and loved her,
Chelsea Clinton, and turned her
into a political hack.

31:40.065 --> 31:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it was just absolutely
reckless and stupid. They
neutralized the advantage and

31:46.037 --> 31:53.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the value of Chelsea Clinton by
turning her into an attack dog
on a phony charge that

31:53.011 --> 31:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, a supporter of
single-payer national health
insurance, is somehow going

31:57.549 --> 32:01.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to dismantle children's
health and Medicare.

32:01.653 --> 32:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it was -- it tells you
how nervous, how dumb, what bad
judgment there is in that

32:08.126 --> 32:09.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: They're worse on
the attack. They're worse on the
counterattack.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: They
tend to overreact.

32:14.933 --> 32:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I were Hillary Clinton, I
would think, I may lose Iowa and
New Hampshire, it's possible,

32:19.271 --> 32:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I got a lot of big states
with more diverse electorates.
I'm still fine. And so don't

32:22.140 --> 32:25.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poison the brand.

32:25.911 --> 32:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think they're just
getting too combative,
overreacting and making it
worse. Now, I understand

32:30.916 --> 32:35.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why they're concerned. There is
a gigantic anti-establishment
mood in both parties. I

32:35.921 --> 32:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understand that. But there is --
so far, there is little evidence
that Sanders can translate

32:40.992 --> 32:45.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early victories into victories
in states, frankly, where there
are more minority voters,

32:45.397 --> 32:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more -- more -- frankly, more
conventional and more
representative of the country.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's still sitting pretty
in those states, and she should
just let it be.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you think she
should just relax and not worry
about losing Iowa and

32:59.878 --> 33:01.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New Hampshire?

33:01.713 --> 33:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, unless she
can counterattack effectively,
not with something that is
plainly

33:02.614 --> 33:04.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disingenuous.

33:04.316 --> 33:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're going to hit a weak
spot, Bernie Sanders' weak spot
is not that he is against

33:08.887 --> 33:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care for people who
need health insurance.

33:12.457 --> 33:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. Bernie
Sanders, whatever else, you look
at him, he's not pretty. He's

33:16.661 --> 33:17.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not a backslapper.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, his
wife would disagree.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, no, but he's
not a storyteller. He's not
somebody you say, oh, gee, I
want

33:23.668 --> 33:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a cuddly Bernie, or, boy,
he's a well-polished guy.

33:28.306 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's authentic. He's absolutely
authentic. And this attack was
synthetic. It was fabricated.

33:34.212 --> 33:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would say that there is a
concern in the Clinton campaign.
What you have got to

33:38.483 --> 33:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do is somehow project her as a
more likable person. This didn't
make her a more likable

33:41.920 --> 33:44.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person or candidate.

33:44.890 --> 33:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, nobody has been
nominated in the modern era who
lost both Iowa and New
Hampshire.

33:49.728 --> 33:50.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: So,
there's a chemistry.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, maybe she
shouldn't relax about losing...

33:53.498 --> 33:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, but
this isn't a normal year.

33:54.833 --> 33:55.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And -- go ahead.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:57.535 --> 34:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I just think
that momentum could be
dangerous, and especially how
you

34:01.072 --> 34:03.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lose them.

34:03.508 --> 34:09.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you lose them looking
mean-spirited and small-minded,
it can't be helpful in Nevada.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. In some
sense, I almost feel like the
big question is not day to day.

34:13.919 --> 34:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's how deep is the disgust in
the country. It's the tectonic
question.

34:18.523 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if the disgust in the
country is -- it's certainly
deeper than -- we all knew it
was

34:22.727 --> 34:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there. But there is a level of
anger which is not only there,
but building. And I think

34:27.098 --> 34:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
events are building it, even the
attacks on Cologne, especially
on the Republican side,

34:31.369 --> 34:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
building that anger. And that
could sweep away the -- all the
establishment candidates.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All
right, on that note...

34:36.341 --> 34:37.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:37.709 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks and
Mark Shields, thank you both.

34:39.444 --> 34:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thanks. Thank you.

34:47.085 --> 34:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

34:55.560 --> 35:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Silicon Valley, the home of the
California tech industry, has
long been criticized for

35:00.565 --> 35:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its lack of diversity. Almost
two years after major companies,
led by Google and Intel,

35:07.605 --> 35:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started to publicize their
diversity numbers, the ethnic
and gender makeup of the
industry's

35:11.409 --> 35:15.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
work force remains
almost the same.

35:15.714 --> 35:20.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Analysis of employees at the
leading tech firms that report
such figures reveals, on

35:20.585 --> 35:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average, 71 percent are men, 29
percent are women, 60 percent
identify as white, 23 percent

35:27.993 --> 35:32.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Asian, 8 percent Latino,
and 7 percent black.

35:32.530 --> 35:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what exactly is Silicon
Valley doing to improve its
diversity?

35:37.569 --> 35:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan takes a look
in the first of two stories.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOELLE EMERSON, CEO, Paradigm:
Raise your hand if you have
heard of unconscious bias

35:43.108 --> 35:45.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before?

35:45.343 --> 35:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The notion
that hidden bias can be
methodically stamped out of the
workplace

35:48.880 --> 35:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has become popular with tech
companies across Silicon Valley.

35:52.517 --> 35:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOELLE EMERSON: By managing
unconscious bias, we make better
decisions. So, unconscious

35:58.356 --> 36:03.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bias acts as a significant
barrier to objective,
data-driven decision making.

36:03.261 --> 36:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That was the
message being delivered by
Joelle Emerson, a former sexual

36:07.265 --> 36:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harassment litigator who now
spends most of her time helping
multibillion-dollar start-ups

36:11.503 --> 36:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
diversify their work forces.

36:14.305 --> 36:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOELLE EMERSON: We think that if
you can get this right early,
you're going to much more

36:18.943 --> 36:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
successfully, more organically
grow as an inclusive company,
rather than starting when

36:24.182 --> 36:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're so far down the line.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the word is associated with
female, I want you to raise your
right hand and say the word

36:29.754 --> 36:31.423 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

36:31.423 --> 36:37.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On this day,
Emerson is conducting a workshop
at Slack, a $2.8 billion

36:37.862 --> 36:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start-up just named company of
the year by "Inc." magazine.
Even though his company is

36:42.267 --> 36:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still young, Slack CEO Stewart
Butterfield is still playing a
little catchup.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEWART BUTTERFIELD, CEO, Slack:
We didn't get started in the
beginning, right? This

36:49.174 --> 36:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
company was co-founded by four
white men. But it was something
that became apparent

36:55.480 --> 36:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a priority to us when we were
relatively small, you know,
about 30 or 40 people.

36:59.084 --> 37:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Known for its
workplace communication app,
Slack is regarded as one

37:02.587 --> 37:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the hottest and fastest
growing tech start-ups.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BUTTERFIELD: We are
growing incredibly quickly. I
mean, we have to do a lot of
hiring,

37:09.894 --> 37:12.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which means that there's a lot
of positions that need to get
filled. Every week, there's

37:12.864 --> 37:16.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new people starting. Every
week, there's open roles.

37:16.501 --> 37:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And when
there's rapid growth, a natural
inclination is to recruit from
familiar

37:20.105 --> 37:22.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
networks.

37:22.340 --> 37:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senior engineer Erica Baker says
that's at the core of tech's
diversity problem.

37:26.811 --> 37:30.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERICA BAKER, Engineer, Slack:
There's a lot of focus put on,
like, hiring people you know,

37:30.782 --> 37:34.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who you're comfortable with or
whatever. And a lot of people
who get into Silicon Valley

37:34.819 --> 37:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come from backgrounds that are
predominantly white, and so they
hire the people that they

37:42.393 --> 37:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, who are predominantly
white, and it's cyclical. It
will take someone, like,
stopping

37:47.398 --> 37:50.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that cycle purposefully
to fix it.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE TOTH, Vice President for
People and Policy, Slack: We're
going to be hiring a lot of
people

37:52.270 --> 37:54.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next year.

37:54.672 --> 37:58.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Slack's vice
president for people and policy,
Anne Toth, says she's working

37:58.076 --> 38:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hard to break that cycle.

38:00.712 --> 38:05.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE TOTH: One of the things I'm
trying to do here, early stage,
is build the type of

38:05.683 --> 38:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tools from the outset that allow
us to look at the data in real
time and make adjustments

38:09.454 --> 38:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we go. Are we promoting women
and people of color at the same
rate? Are we retaining

38:13.892 --> 38:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them at the same rate? Are we
paying them equitably? Are they
as engaged as other employees

38:17.896 --> 38:19.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the board?

38:19.998 --> 38:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the day we
visited, Toth and diversity
consultant Joelle Emerson were

38:23.535 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reviewing questions with a
group of hiring managers

38:26.804 --> 38:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOELLE EMERSON: Where we often
go wrong is that we ask
questions that produce answers

38:31.576 --> 38:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that cannot be objectively
evaluated, that almost force us
to draw on unconscious biases,

38:36.548 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on subjectivity, on our own
beliefs about the world to
evaluate the candidate's answer.

38:41.419 --> 38:45.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The goal, to
eliminate any potential bias
that might unfairly favor one

38:45.223 --> 38:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
type of applicant over another.

38:48.092 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: What do you do for fun?
What do you think of that
question?

38:51.062 --> 38:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We want to know more
about who you are, not just what
you do for work.

38:54.599 --> 38:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOELLE EMERSON: We don't want to
take the humanity out of this
process, but it really

38:59.003 --> 39:02.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't relevant to your ability
to do work here, what you do for
fun. And what if what

39:02.640 --> 39:06.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you do for fun is different than
what the person who happens to
be interviewing you

39:06.277 --> 39:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does for fun, that can be really
challenging. What if my answer
is, I don't have a whole

39:10.715 --> 39:14.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of time for a lot of fun, I
have two kids right now that are
infants, and mostly my

39:14.085 --> 39:17.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spare time is spent
taking care of them?

39:17.222 --> 39:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Despite these
efforts, Slack's diversity
numbers are still not
dramatically

39:20.992 --> 39:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different from the industry.
Seventy percent of its employees
are white, and 61 percent

39:25.230 --> 39:27.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are men.

39:27.398 --> 39:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But CEO Stewart Butterfield says
there are some encouraging
trends.

39:31.769 --> 39:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEWART BUTTERFIELD: Forty-one
percent of employees at Slack
report to a woman; 45 percent

39:37.242 --> 39:40.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the managers and executives
are women. So, that's definitely
better than the industry

39:40.078 --> 39:42.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
average.

39:42.680 --> 39:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For Erica
Baker, an African-American
engineer, diversity is about
race, as well

39:46.451 --> 39:48.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as gender.

39:48.720 --> 39:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERICA BAKER: Right now, it seems
like, in the industry, that
diversity is code for hire

39:55.226 --> 40:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more women. That is what
diversity has become. And it's
not great, because the
demographics

40:02.433 --> 40:06.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the industry, usually, it
skews to more white women.

40:06.871 --> 40:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Baker says
she is encouraged by the
direction Slack is heading.
Seven percent

40:11.643 --> 40:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the company's engineers are
African-American. Compare that
with the industry average of

40:15.079 --> 40:20.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
1 percent to 2 percent.

40:20.685 --> 40:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To change the demographics of an
industry takes time, and one
long-term effort involves

40:26.124 --> 40:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encouraging more women and
people of color to study
engineering. Many companies are
now

40:30.895 --> 40:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sponsoring training for high
school and college students like
this code camp hosted by the

40:34.699 --> 40:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mobile payment firm Square.

40:37.101 --> 40:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK DORSEY, CEO, Square: One of
the things I have always loved
about programming and

40:41.105 --> 40:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
computer science is that you can
truly build something from
scratch.

40:45.209 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While CEO Jack
Dorsey has not yet publicized
square's diversity figures,

40:50.315 --> 40:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his executive team includes
several women in key roles, like
chief financial officer

40:54.285 --> 40:56.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and head of engineering.

40:56.554 --> 40:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANESSA SLAVICH, Diversity Lead,
Square: At Square, we started at
the top. So, our board

40:59.457 --> 41:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of directors is really diverse.
They're driving the company. You
move down to our executive

41:03.761 --> 41:07.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team, four out nine of the
people who report to Jack are
CEO-quality women who are
running

41:07.865 --> 41:10.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a majority of the company.

41:10.835 --> 41:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if we can prioritize
from the top, from our board to
the executive team, inevitably,

41:12.904 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will trickle down.

41:16.040 --> 41:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Vanessa
Slavich, diversity lead at
Square, says the company is
constantly

41:20.478 --> 41:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the lookout for tools that
will help widen the pool of
prospective employees.

41:24.449 --> 41:29.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANESSA SLAVICH: So, here, we
have a job description for our
data scientist team.

41:29.253 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One such tool
is Textio. The software uses a
form of artificial intelligence

41:33.358 --> 41:35.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to detect bias in the
job descriptions.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VANESSA SLAVICH: This
is the before copy.

41:38.663 --> 41:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On a scale of
one to 100, it scores 47.
Phrases like rapidly growing

41:45.403 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are regarded as inclusive,
builds relationships feminine,
and words like relentlessly
masculine.

41:52.944 --> 41:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once all the changes are made,
the newly revised job
description scores a 95.

41:57.081 --> 42:01.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANESSA SLAVICH: We did a small
anonymous test with our job
descriptions before and

42:01.552 --> 42:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after, and they doubled in
applications for both men and
women.

42:04.956 --> 42:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While such
efforts can widen the pool of
candidates, Slack's Erica Baker

42:09.293 --> 42:14.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says real, lasting change will
require a cultural shift in the
workplace, taking people beyond

42:14.332 --> 42:16.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their comfort zones.

42:16.634 --> 42:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERICA BAKER: People should know
that you're going to feel weird
about talking about race.

42:21.539 --> 42:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just like sit with it and, like,
then move past it. But it's
going to get uncomfortable.

42:27.445 --> 42:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think people shy away from
talking about those sorts of
things because it is
uncomfortable.

42:31.749 --> 42:37.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think that we need to get
to the uncomfortable spaces to
make good progress.

42:37.855 --> 42:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Progress will
likely take time, especially
with older and larger companies.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In our next story, we visit
Google to see how the tech giant
is trying to make its culture

42:46.697 --> 42:48.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more inclusive.

42:48.099 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

42:52.069 --> 42:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Part two of
Hari's look at diversity in
Silicon Valley airs tomorrow

42:56.674 --> 43:15.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on "PBS NewsHour Weekend."

43:15.726 --> 43:20.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally tonight: the launch of a
new series on PBS, its first
original American drama

43:20.364 --> 43:23.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in more than a decade.

43:23.668 --> 43:30.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown visited the set of
"Mercy Street" in Richmond,
Virginia, and has this preview.

43:30.808 --> 43:45.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Spring 1862: The
carnage on the Civil War goes
on, and some of the wounded

43:45.690 --> 43:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and dying are brought here
to Mansion House Hospital.

43:49.460 --> 43:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Ah. You must be the new
nurse. I am Dr. Hale, chief
operating surgeon.

43:56.067 --> 44:01.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Mercy Street" is
a dramatized account based on
memoirs and letters of doctors

44:01.539 --> 44:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and nurses who served at a Union
facility that also took in a
handful of Confederate

44:05.543 --> 44:10.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soldiers.

44:10.781 --> 44:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real Mansion House, a
one-time luxury hotel
transformed into an Army
hospital, was

44:17.655 --> 44:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Alexandria, Virginia, just
south of Washington. The series
was filmed further south in
Petersburg,

44:23.794 --> 44:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia, as well as in Richmond
at a Civil War-period mansion,
where we visited last

44:27.665 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
summer as shooting
was wrapping up.

44:31.569 --> 44:36.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Josh Radnor plays Jedediah
Foster, a civilian surgeon now
caught up in the pain,
frustrations

44:36.440 --> 44:38.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and blood of the war.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH RADNOR, Actor: Be prepared.
This may bleed a bit.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTRESS: Yes.

44:42.780 --> 44:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH RADNOR: It's life and death
in a hospital. Plus, you throw
the Civil War on top of it,

44:46.150 --> 44:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have got pretty much the
most dramatic situation you
could ever imagine.

44:51.088 --> 44:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's this feeling that it's
entirely grounded in its time
and place, and, at the same
time,

44:56.494 --> 45:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it feels modern and urgent and
vital. It feels like you're
walking into this, like,
bustling,

45:03.234 --> 45:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alive, relatable story with
people that you recognize
somehow.

45:08.306 --> 45:11.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: This is what
happens to traitors.

45:11.275 --> 45:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alexandria was
the only Confederate town
occupied by the Union for all
four years

45:17.148 --> 45:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the war, and much of the
drama here involves the
interaction of Northerners and
Southerners.

45:23.154 --> 45:37.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're enemies, but also at
times forced to work side by
side, as with two volunteer
nurses, one

45:37.768 --> 45:42.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a staunch New England
abolitionist, the other an
inexperienced young woman whose
life has

45:42.239 --> 45:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been upended by occupation.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays
the Northerner Mary Phinney.

45:48.879 --> 45:52.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD,
Actress: Both feel very
passionately about what they
believe

45:52.149 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, but, as the series goes on,
you kind of see the complexities
in who they both are,

45:58.289 --> 46:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they find ways to connect,
even though they have such
differing views on such very

46:03.761 --> 46:10.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big, big issues. They see the
humanity in one another and are
able to kind of to work

46:10.801 --> 46:14.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alongside each other.

46:14.372 --> 46:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ridley Scott
served as executive producer of
the series. It was created and

46:21.145 --> 46:26.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
written by David Zabel and Lisa
Wolfinger, he known for his work
writing and overseeing

46:26.817 --> 46:33.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hit network drama "ER," she
a veteran writer and producer of
films and TV programs.

46:33.057 --> 46:35.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA WOLFINGER, Producer, "Mercy
Street": I thought, well, maybe,
maybe we can find

46:35.893 --> 46:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new way to tell an old story.
And it hit me that nobody has
ever really explored the

46:42.233 --> 46:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medical side of it. We kind of
like to think of this show as
"Gone With the Wind" meets

46:44.635 --> 46:46.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
"MASH."

46:46.370 --> 46:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ZABEL, Producer, "Mercy
Street": We wanted to find a way
to find the drama in

46:49.507 --> 46:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the medical. How do we tell the
story of medical advances during
the Civil War, but infuse

46:54.345 --> 46:58.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it with drama? And Alexandria,
Virginia, became this great
window into all -- a whole bunch

46:58.849 --> 47:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of different aspects of the war
and all kinds of different
characters.

47:03.020 --> 47:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really became much more of a
family saga combined with a
medical drama combined with

47:07.692 --> 47:11.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sort of a wartime epic.

47:11.595 --> 47:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the most
complex and moving stories in
"Mercy Street" is that of

47:17.735 --> 47:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Samuel Diggs, a free black
working as a orderly in the
hospital.

47:23.674 --> 47:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'd grown up a servant in the
home of a Philadelphia doctor
and, unbeknownst to the Mansion
House

47:29.180 --> 47:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staff, had learned a great deal
about medical practice. As the
story unfolds, he gets the

47:40.758 --> 47:43.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chance to do work otherwise
denied him in a segregated
society.

47:43.994 --> 47:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm talking to a man with a
lot of blood on his sleeve.

47:46.731 --> 47:48.032 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MCKINLEY BELCHER
III, Actor: Yes.

47:48.032 --> 47:50.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well-earned?

47:50.201 --> 47:51.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MCKINLEY BELCHER III:
Well-earned. This is actually
the blood of my love on my
sleeves.

47:51.902 --> 47:52.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:52.703 --> 47:53.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
blood of your love?

47:53.671 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MCKINLEY BELCHER III: Yes,
the blood of my love.

47:55.372 --> 48:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did a scene yesterday, all
yesterday, that we were sort of
operating on her, so, yes.

48:01.312 --> 48:05.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Actor McKinley
Belcher III told us this role
had special meaning for

48:05.249 --> 48:07.251 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

48:07.251 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MCKINLEY BELCHER III: I think,
for Samuel, that how strongly he
feels about being a doctor

48:13.190 --> 48:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and being involved in the
medical world is something
that's sort of at the forefront

48:16.694 --> 48:19.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of his mind all the time.

48:19.029 --> 48:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm playing a young man who is
single-minded, in many ways a
positive image of a young black

48:27.638 --> 48:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man, and who is career-oriented,
has integrity, and a sort of
quiet strength about him. It

48:35.446 --> 48:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes me really proud to put
that out in the world. And I
think, in some ways, as an
artist,

48:40.451 --> 48:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to be responsible for the
images I portray and for the
truth I put out in the

48:44.522 --> 48:47.625 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
world. And I'm
proud of this one.

48:47.625 --> 48:52.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The producers
also clearly took some pride in
the series' authenticity.

48:52.329 --> 48:59.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Civil War hospital was no
setting for the squeamish.
Amputations were performed
numerous

48:59.203 --> 49:03.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
times each day with
minimal or no anesthesia.

49:03.440 --> 49:09.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're standing in front of a
pretty bloody scene, right, at
least fake blood.

49:09.146 --> 49:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Surgeon and medical historian
Stanley Burns served as
consultant to the series.

49:13.184 --> 49:17.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. STANLEY BURNS, Consultant:
This is a capital operating kit.
This is what a surgeon used

49:17.221 --> 49:22.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during the war. And there were
several of them at each
regiment. For instance, we show

49:22.359 --> 49:26.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in one of the scenes -- let me
take this out -- they're still
sharp and problematical.

49:26.463 --> 49:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, this is a capital
amputation saw. They actually
took the saw, you see, around

49:32.937 --> 49:36.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the arm, and then, in one
fell swoop, cut it off.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
how you do it, yes.

49:39.577 --> 49:44.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. STANLEY BURNS: The whole
amputation, if the surgeons were
slow, it would take five

49:44.381 --> 49:49.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minutes, but a good, experienced
surgeon could do it, complete an
amputation in two minutes.

49:49.486 --> 49:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Series creators
Wolfinger and Zabel say they
worked hard for realism and

49:53.190 --> 49:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were happy PBS embraced it.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA WOLFINGER: PBS was such a
natural home for it, and I think
in many ways we designed

49:58.062 --> 50:00.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it for PBS.

50:00.164 --> 50:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ZABEL: If we tried to tell
this story in a lot of other
places, there would be a

50:03.100 --> 50:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot more pressure to, I think,
stray, stray from the facts,
from the history.

50:09.540 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a view of
history not from the
battlefield, but through the
lives

50:13.177 --> 50:16.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of those trying to
heal its victims.

50:16.180 --> 50:20.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The six-part miniseries "Mercy
Street" premieres Sunday night.

50:20.851 --> 50:25.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Richmond, Virginia, I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

50:25.055 --> 50:30.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can
stream the first episode of
"Mercy Street" online right now

50:30.094 --> 50:50.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about PBS.org. And the broadcast
premiere is Sunday on most PBS
stations.

50:50.681 --> 50:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we turn to a "NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that we thought might

50:53.384 --> 50:56.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be of interest to you.

50:56.520 --> 51:02.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Public Library
recently made available a
collection of more than 180,000

51:02.459 --> 51:08.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
images in high resolution to the

reaching back centuries,

51:08.499 --> 51:13.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all accessible with the click of
a mouse. The earliest images
date back to the 11th

51:43.567 --> 51:48.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the "NewsHour" online
right now: It turns out we share
more than just fun times

51:48.706 --> 51:55.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with our friends. A new study of
chimpanzees shows that being
social helps diversify the

51:55.346 --> 51:59.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bacteria in primates' bodies,
boosting resistance to
infection. In other words,
friends keep

51:59.883 --> 52:01.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us healthy.

52:01.552 --> 52:07.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Later tonight on "Washington
Week": why political rhetoric is
getting more personal and
divisive

52:12.629 --> 52:18.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the 2016 campaign trail, plus
a deep dive into President
Obama's final State of the

52:18.635 --> 52:22.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union. Was it about his legacy
or the race to succeed him?
That's tonight on "Washington

52:22.706 --> 52:25.109 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Week."

52:25.109 --> 52:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: A program in Brooklyn,
New York, aims to reduce the

52:29.613 --> 52:34.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of outstanding arrest
warrants for low-level crimes.

52:34.551 --> 52:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: On a Saturday morning,
a crowd waits outside the Mount
Lebanon Baptist Church in

52:40.257 --> 52:45.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brooklyn, New York. Hundreds
more pack the sanctuary inside.
They're seeking forgiveness,

52:45.396 --> 52:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not from a higher power, but
from New York City's criminal
justice system.

52:49.366 --> 52:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The event is called Begin Again.

52:51.969 --> 52:56.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I'm here to clear up a past
warrant that I had for
trespassing.

52:56.507 --> 52:59.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: There's nothing worse than
walking around the city and
having a cloud hanging over your

52:59.810 --> 53:01.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
head.

53:01.578 --> 53:05.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Brooklyn district
attorney Kenneth Thompson
started Begin Again last year.

53:05.949 --> 53:08.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH THOMPSON, Brooklyn
District Attorney: Warrants
never go away. So, when people
apply

53:08.752 --> 53:15.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for jobs, they come up in
background checks. It could
affect someone's application for

53:15.893 --> 53:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizenship. It could affect
someone's ability to get
housing. So, there are real
consequences

53:19.363 --> 53:21.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to outstanding warrants.

53:21.565 --> 53:25.035 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
That's this weekend.

53:25.035 --> 53:30.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tonight on "Charlie Rose:
The Week": Actor Sean Penn
defends his controversial
interview

53:30.240 --> 53:34.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the drug cartel boss
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.

53:34.344 --> 53:43.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN PENN, Actor: I had only
that I thought this is somebody
upon whose interview could

53:43.487 --> 53:50.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I begin a conversation about the
