AT THE SECOND THE POLLS CLOSED.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS NO CHANCE AT ALL

02:35.956 --> 02:37.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE WOULD TAKE THIS.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUGE ONE FOR HILLARY.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SHE DIDN'T

EVEN SPEND MOST OF THE DAY

CAMPAIGNING IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'S KIND OF MOVED ON.

02:45.399 --> 02:49.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SHE POPPED OUT IN ALABAMA AND

02:49.136 --> 02:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN AFTER THIS.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY KNEW THE RACE WAS OVER.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF HARD WORK.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SPENT MORE TIME THAN BERN

02:55.242 --> 02:56.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILLARY CLINTON AND BILL CLINTON

02:58.979 --> 03:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:05.652 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES WHERE HE THINKS HE HAS A

03:07.621 --> 03:08.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOP.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE KIND OF SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN

03:09.556 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP A LITTLE ON SOUTH CAROLINA

03:12.459 --> 03:12.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLIER.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHY HAVE THE

03:13.627 --> 03:15.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTONS FOCUSED SO HEAVILY ON

03:15.762 --> 03:18.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS AND WHAT DO THEY HOPE TO

03:18.031 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE WITH THEM TO THE NEXT SET

03:19.733 --> 03:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF STATES AFTER THIS WIN?

03:22.235 --> 03:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS

03:23.403 --> 03:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIN IS IT SHOWS HE HAS NOT MADE

03:25.238 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INROADS WITH THE

03:27.240 --> 03:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS HE WOULD

03:28.408 --> 03:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED TO DO WELL ON SUPER

03:30.477 --> 03:30.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TUESDAY.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXIT POLLS SHOWED SHE BEAT

03:33.346 --> 03:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM 5-1, AFRICAN-AMERICAN

03:38.151 --> 03:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTERS.

03:38.518 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN WE'RE GOING INTO GEORGIA

03:39.686 --> 03:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ARKANSAS AND TENNESSEE AND A

03:41.054 --> 03:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF SOUTHERN STATES WITH A

03:43.623 --> 03:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMILAR POPULATION TO

03:45.325 --> 03:46.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE HE HAS

03:46.226 --> 03:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPENT MUCH MONEY AND LESS TIME

03:48.695 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR HIM TO

03:50.330 --> 03:52.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ABLE TO COMPETE WELL THERE.

03:52.299 --> 03:56.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS KIND OF A PRECURSOR

03:56.770 --> 03:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WHAT CLINTON OPERATORS ARE

03:59.339 --> 04:01.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELLING ME NOW IS THEY THINK THE

04:01.942 --> 04:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATH WILL NOT ADD UP FOR HIM,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN IF HE WINS THE FIVE STATES

04:06.279 --> 04:08.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE THINKS HE CAN WIN ON SUPER

04:08.048 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TUESDAY, WHICH IS COLORADO,

04:11.418 --> 04:12.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OKLAHOMA, MINNESOTA,

04:12.119 --> 04:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSACHUSETTS AND HIS HOME STATE

04:13.286 --> 04:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VERMONT, EVEN IF HE WINS

04:15.355 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE, THEY STILL EXPECT TO COME

04:17.924 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF TUESDAY WITH A

04:19.659 --> 04:20.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50-DELEGATE LEAD AND THEY DON'T

04:20.694 --> 04:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK HE WILL EVER CATCH UP

04:22.629 --> 04:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN.

04:22.929 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

04:23.530 --> 04:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING SHE DID ON THE CAMPAIGN

04:24.764 --> 04:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAIL IN TERMS OF CHANGING OR

04:26.566 --> 04:28.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFINING HER MESSAGE?

04:28.735 --> 04:29.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED HERE, IT

04:29.703 --> 04:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS ACTUALLY INTERESTING TO
