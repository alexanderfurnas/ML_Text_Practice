GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is

00:03.470 --> 00:06.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away. On the "NewsHour" tonight:
BARACK OBAMA, President of the

00:06.940 --> 00:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States: But if we act
here and if we act now... GWEN

00:11.445 --> 00:14.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: President Obama joins
hundreds of world leaders in

00:14.481 --> 00:18.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paris, calling for an ambitious
agreement to combat climate

00:18.418 --> 00:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change. Also ahead: the first in
our weeklong series from

00:22.990 --> 00:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nigeria, where the country is
battling the brutal group Boko

00:26.994 --> 00:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haram. DR. GERIDA BIRUKILA,
UNICEF: We have children who

00:29.596 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have arrived, and they lost
their voice because of what they

00:33.333 --> 00:37.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saw. It seems that the war still
rages in their mind. GWEN IFILL:

00:37.938 --> 00:42.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this Politics Monday: truth
on the trail, parsing facts in

00:42.609 --> 00:46.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the race for the White House.
All that and more on tonight's

00:46.113 --> 00:51.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"PBS NewsHour." (BREAK) GWEN
IFILL: The place is Paris. The

01:02.262 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
subject is global warming. The
goal is the strongest agreement

01:06.366 --> 01:09.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yet to rein in rising
temperatures. What could be

01:09.803 --> 01:13.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult talks on the issue
began today. FRANCOIS HOLLANDE,

01:13.273 --> 01:15.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French President (through
translator): On this first day

01:15.442 --> 01:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the conference, we have our
backs against the wall. GWEN

01:18.412 --> 01:21.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: The summit opened with a
warning from its host, French

01:21.915 --> 01:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Francois Hollande.
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE (through

01:25.619 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
translator): This wall is built
on all our egoisms, our fears,

01:30.590 --> 01:33.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our resignations. This wall is
built on indifference,

01:34.027 --> 01:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recklessness, and weakness. But
this wall can be scaled and it

01:37.264 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all depends on us. GWEN IFILL:
In all, 151 heads of state and

01:42.069 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government converged on the
French capital. They're hoping

01:45.472 --> 01:49.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to finalize an accord on
reducing heat-trapping emissions

01:49.543 --> 01:53.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of greenhouse gases. But the
Paris attacks loomed in the

01:53.513 --> 01:57.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
background, as President
Hollande argued the problems of

01:57.250 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate and security are linked.
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE (through

02:02.622 --> 02:06.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
translator): They're two big
world challenges that we have to

02:06.259 --> 02:09.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overcome, because we have to
leave our children something

02:09.496 --> 02:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than a world free of
terror. We owe them a planet

02:12.666 --> 02:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preserved from catastrophe. GWEN
IFILL: To underscore the point,

02:16.470 --> 02:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after arriving last night,
President Obama paid a visit to

02:19.940 --> 02:24.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Bataclan concert hall, one
of the sites of the attacks.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, he was among the first to
speak, and he spoke hopefully of

02:28.982 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a turning point on more than
just climate. BARACK OBAMA,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President of the United States:
Let that be the common purpose

02:33.687 --> 02:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here in Paris, a world that is
worthy of our children, a world

02:37.657 --> 02:41.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is marked not by conflict,
but by cooperation, and not by

02:41.628 --> 02:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human suffering, but by human
progress, a world that's safer

02:45.699 --> 02:49.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and more prosperous and more
secure and more free than the

02:49.603 --> 02:53.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one that we inherited. GWEN
IFILL: A similar effort

02:53.273 --> 02:56.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collapsed in Copenhagen six
years ago, but, this time, many

02:56.910 --> 03:01.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries committed to action in
advance. Last year, Mr. Obama

03:01.848 --> 03:07.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pledged to reduce U.S. carbon
emissions by 26-28 percent below

03:07.454 --> 03:12.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2005 levels over the next
decade. And China, the world's

03:12.092 --> 03:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
largest greenhouse gas producer,
has said it will slash emissions

03:16.063 --> 03:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by at least 60 percent by 2030.
For any deal to be meaningful,

03:21.435 --> 03:24.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
India, the world's third largest
emitter, would have to make

03:24.838 --> 03:29.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solid cuts as well. But Indian
Prime Minister Narendra Modi

03:29.142 --> 03:33.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said today developing nations
need room to grow. NARENDRA

03:33.513 --> 03:35.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MODI, India Prime Minister: We
have to ensure, in the spirit of

03:35.549 --> 03:41.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate justice, that the life
of a few doesn't cloud out the

03:41.855 --> 03:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities for the many still
on the initial steps of the

03:47.294 --> 03:50.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
development ladder. GWEN IFILL:
Chinese President Xi Jinping,

03:50.664 --> 03:53.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speaking at the summit, echoed
that concern and called for

03:53.867 --> 03:57.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
addressing economic differences.
XI JINPING, Chinese President

03:57.504 --> 04:00.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(through translator): Countries
need to increase dialogue,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exchange best practices and
achieve common development

04:03.009 --> 04:06.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through mutual learning. At the
same time, countries should be

04:06.213 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allowed to pursue their own
solutions that best suit their

04:09.216 --> 04:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respective national conditions.
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. joined

04:13.120 --> 04:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Canada, Germany, Italy and
others today in committing $250

04:17.757 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million for poorer nations.
President Obama also announced a

04:22.996 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private sector initiative led by
Microsoft founder Bill Gates and

04:27.000 --> 04:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other billionaires to boost
investment in clean energy.

04:30.670 --> 04:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still, any broad agreement in
Paris will not take the form of

04:34.474 --> 04:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a legally enforceable treaty.
But German Chancellor Angela

04:38.512 --> 04:42.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Merkel called for transparent,
credible commitments. ANGELA

04:42.549 --> 04:46.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through translator): We need a

04:46.119 --> 04:49.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United Nations framework that is
binding, and we need binding

04:49.322 --> 04:52.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reviews. We know that the
agreements are made voluntary,

04:52.559 --> 04:54.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it's also important that we
also stick to what we have

04:55.028 --> 04:58.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
promised. GWEN IFILL: The Paris
conference is set to run through

04:58.532 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
December 11. We will explore
what's at stake in Paris in

05:03.170 --> 05:06.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
detail after the news summary.
And in the day's other news,

05:06.907 --> 05:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even as the climate conference
convened, a choking smog filled

05:11.111 --> 05:15.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the air in Chinese cities,
prompting hazardous pollution

05:15.048 --> 05:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warnings. Beijing had its worst
air quality of the year, and

05:19.019 --> 05:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials ordered an orange
alert, the second-highest level.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Schools suspended outdoor
activities, while factories had

05:26.092 --> 05:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to cut back on output. WOMAN
(through translator): The smog

05:29.863 --> 05:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a very serious problem. In my
opinion, this is the consequence

05:33.233 --> 05:37.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of having too many cars. There
should be more measures to fight

05:37.537 --> 05:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this. MAN (through translator):
I have installed air filters at

05:40.507 --> 05:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home. When I leave home, I put
on a mask. And, in my car, I

05:43.877 --> 05:47.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also installed an air purifying
system. GWEN IFILL: And in

05:47.180 --> 05:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
India, heavy smog also blanketed
New Delhi, cutting visibility to

05:51.885 --> 05:56.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a mere 200 yards. Air quality in
the Indian capital routinely

05:56.256 --> 06:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets worse in the winter, when
more coal fires are burning.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Investigators in Colorado shed
no light today on the case

06:03.997 --> 06:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against Robert Lewis Dear. He's
accused of killing three people

06:07.801 --> 06:10.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a Planned Parenthood clinic.
There was no discussion of

06:10.837 --> 06:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
motive as Dear had his first
court appearance, via video link

06:14.507 --> 06:19.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from jail. He's being held on
suspicion of murder. In

06:19.212 --> 06:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baltimore, jury selection began
for the first of six police

06:22.315 --> 06:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officers charged in the Freddie
Gray case. He died in police

06:26.353 --> 06:30.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
custody last April, triggering
protests and riots. Officer

06:30.390 --> 06:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Porter is charged with
assault, manslaughter and

06:33.526 --> 06:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reckless endangerment. And a
judge in Chicago set bond at

06:37.631 --> 06:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$1.5 million for a white officer
charged with murdering a black

06:42.002 --> 06:46.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teenager. Squad car video showed
officer Jason Van Dyke shooting

06:46.773 --> 06:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the victim, Laquan McDonald, 16
times. Release of that video led

06:51.544 --> 06:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to days of protests. In Israel,
a judge has convicted two Jewish

06:56.449 --> 07:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teenagers of beating and burning
alive a Palestinian teen last

07:00.387 --> 07:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year. The attack in Jerusalem
was part of a chain of events

07:03.923 --> 07:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leading to the Gaza war. The
judge today delayed a verdict

07:07.827 --> 07:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the alleged ringleader of
the killings after he filed a

07:11.231 --> 07:15.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last-minute insanity plea. But
the victim's father vowed to

07:15.168 --> 07:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pursue justice. HUSSEIN ABU
KHDEIR, Victim's Father (through

07:19.572 --> 07:22.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
translator): I don't trust those
Israeli courts because they rule

07:22.909 --> 07:27.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
differently for Arabs and
Israelis. We will pursue them.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If the Israeli court won't try
them, we want something more

07:30.050 --> 07:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than a life sentence. We will go
to the International Court of

07:32.852 --> 07:35.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice. GWEN IFILL: The two
convicted minors are expected to

07:35.722 --> 07:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be sentenced in mid-January.
Pope Francis spent the final day

07:39.826 --> 07:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his Africa trip in the
Central African Republic

07:42.796 --> 07:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delivering a message of peace
and reconciliation. The pontiff

07:46.499 --> 07:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
visited Muslims in the capital
city, where conflict between

07:49.636 --> 07:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslim and Christian militias
has raged in recent years. He

07:53.406 --> 07:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said religion can never justify
violence. Turkey refused today

07:58.311 --> 08:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to apologize for shooting down a
Russian fighter jet last week,

08:01.981 --> 08:04.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
despite the threat of new
sanctions by Moscow. In

wants to talk, and wants to
prevent any future unintentional

08:18.598 --> 08:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
events like this, we are ready

08:21.968 --> 08:25.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to improve relations, normalize
relations in all sense, we are

08:25.472 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ready to talk. But no country
can ask us to apologize because

08:31.845 --> 08:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of doing our job. GWEN IFILL: In

08:36.082 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vladimir Putin charged that
Turkey's real motive was

08:39.786 --> 08:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protecting oil supplies coming
from Islamic State forces inside

08:43.957 --> 08:47.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria. In Washington, the State
Department urged both sides to

08:47.560 --> 08:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
de-escalate tensions. Back in
this country, the Environmental

08:51.264 --> 08:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protection Agency is requiring
more ethanol and other renewable

08:54.901 --> 08:59.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fuels in gasoline next year. The
rule issued today is a victory

08:59.472 --> 09:02.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for farm states over oil
companies and environmentalists.

09:02.776 --> 09:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could also become an issue in
Iowa's presidential caucuses.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And concerns about holiday
spending weighed on Wall Street,

09:10.283 --> 09:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after Black Friday sales fell
from last year. The Dow Jones

09:14.587 --> 09:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
industrial average lost 78
points to close below 17720. The

09:20.293 --> 09:25.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nasdaq fell nearly 19 points.
And the S&amp;P 500 slipped nine.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what stands in the way of

09:28.067 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
addressing climate change;
terrorism, war and corruption,

09:32.172 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the human toll in Nigeria; truth
or fiction on the campaign

09:36.843 --> 09:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trail; and much more. The
climate talks over the next two

09:52.759 --> 09:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weeks are expected to become a
turning point in the global

09:55.929 --> 09:59.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate over addressing the
causes of a rapidly warming

09:59.332 --> 10:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planet. The lofty speeches have
already begun, but what do

10:02.936 --> 10:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaders gathering in Paris this
week hope to accomplish? And

10:06.539 --> 10:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what could get in the way? We
check in with Seth Borenstein, a

10:10.310 --> 10:13.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
science writer for the
Associated Press. He joins us

10:13.346 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight from Paris. And Michael
Levi is with the Council on

10:17.083 --> 10:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foreign Relations. He's the
director of its Program on

10:19.953 --> 10:23.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Energy, Security and Climate
Change. Gentlemen, welcome to

10:23.289 --> 10:27.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you both. Seth Borenstein, what
are all these nations gathered

10:27.594 --> 10:30.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in one place hoping to
accomplish this time? SETH

10:30.163 --> 10:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BORENSTEIN, Associated Press:
Well, this time, they're hoping

10:32.165 --> 10:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to come up with some kind of
deal, a binding deal that could

10:35.535 --> 10:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reduce the amount of carbon
emissions coming from

10:39.772 --> 10:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fossil-burning fossil fuels.
They have tried year after year,

10:43.743 --> 10:47.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and have failed year after year
in the past. GWEN IFILL: When

10:47.547 --> 10:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you say binding, I just want you
to clarify that. Do you mean

10:50.517 --> 10:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
binding on nations to hit
certain targets, binding on

10:53.987 --> 10:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nations to come up with certain
amount of money? Binding in what

10:57.090 --> 11:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way? SETH BORENSTEIN: That's the
key question. Everyone says they

11:01.127 --> 11:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want something binding, but it's
sort of, what do you mean by

11:04.430 --> 11:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
binding? And that's one of the
issues that's going to be hashed

11:07.033 --> 11:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out here. It does involve lots
of new money, billions of

11:11.671 --> 11:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dollars, if not eventually
trillions. It involves all these

11:16.309 --> 11:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nations; 181 nations have made
pledges: Here's what we're going

11:20.680 --> 11:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do individually. Now the
binding part is holding them to

11:24.617 --> 11:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these pledges, a system to
monitor these pledges, and

11:28.821 --> 11:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perhaps, if you're not reaching
these pledges, what do you do?

11:32.225 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it's all got to be
designed so that it doesn't go

11:35.728 --> 11:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through the U.S. Senate, because
it can't go through the U.S.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate because of American
politics. GWEN IFILL: And

11:42.402 --> 11:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American politics means that
that requires a two-thirds

11:45.038 --> 11:48.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ratification in the U.S. Senate,
and that's unlikely to happen. I

11:48.575 --> 11:52.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to ask Michael Levi about
what we have seen in the past.

11:52.078 --> 11:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been to these meetings
before in Cancun and in Rio and

11:56.583 --> 11:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kyoto and Copenhagen. Is this
one any different? MICHAEL LEVI,

11:59.819 --> 12:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Council on Foreign Relations: I
think this one is different. I

12:02.021 --> 12:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it's different because
we're starting to set realistic

12:05.258 --> 12:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goals for what these summits can
accomplish. We used to go to

12:08.394 --> 12:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these expecting to take a global
emissions cut that everyone

12:12.498 --> 12:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needed to reach and negotiate
over how to divide it up, then

12:15.535 --> 12:18.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone would go home and
execute that. It was kind of

12:18.104 --> 12:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like old-style arms control
negotiations. I would get rid of

12:21.641 --> 12:23.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this many missiles. You would
get rid of that many. We would

12:23.643 --> 12:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go home, we would do it. It
turns out that climate change

12:26.379 --> 12:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
isn't like that. Leaders can
agree to whatever they want, but

12:29.449 --> 12:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually changing the energy
economy is incredibly difficult.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a lot more like a
domestic policy problem, a

12:35.221 --> 12:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
domestic politics problem than
it is like a traditional foreign

12:38.625 --> 12:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy, national security issue.
So, what's different this time

12:42.295 --> 12:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is that, instead of putting the
burden on Paris to solve the

12:44.731 --> 12:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem, negotiators are asking,
how can we build an

12:47.734 --> 12:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international agreement that
helps countries solve the

12:51.204 --> 12:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem themselves? How do we
help them cut their emissions

12:54.607 --> 12:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more deeply? How do we help them
adapt to climate change? I think

12:57.243 --> 12:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that makes this fundamentally
different. GWEN IFILL: Would you

12:59.245 --> 13:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say -- Mr. Borenstein just
talked about the money which has

13:01.247 --> 13:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be committed here. What would
you say would be the potential

13:03.249 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
major sticking point in the next
11 days? MICHAEL LEVI: I think

13:05.918 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the biggest sticking point is
likely to be over money. When we

13:13.159 --> 13:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saw the clash in Copenhagen six
years ago, the ultimate turning

13:17.296 --> 13:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point was over money. This is
money that comes from wealthier

13:20.833 --> 13:24.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries to help poorer
countries adapt to climate

13:24.237 --> 13:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change, deal with the damages
caused by climate change, and

13:27.740 --> 13:30.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
transition their energy
economies. And it speaks to a

13:30.076 --> 13:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basic political reality, which
is, if you're from a poor

13:33.146 --> 13:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country and you go home from the
climate summit, and you say, we

13:36.449 --> 13:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have got some pledges, countries
are going to take action in the

13:38.751 --> 13:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next 10 years, and that's going
to help us avoid dangerous

13:41.354 --> 13:44.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate change in the next 50,
your people are going to look at

13:44.257 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you and say, what does that mean
to me today? If you come back

13:47.760 --> 13:51.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with pledges of aid, in
addition, then that's a stronger

13:51.464 --> 13:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political proposition. If you
look at the basic politics of

13:54.200 --> 13:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how this works, it leads you to
money. GWEN IFILL: Seth

13:56.636 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Borenstein, we did hear,
speaking of money, today we

13:59.138 --> 14:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heard private sector giants with
names like Gates and Bezos and

14:03.776 --> 14:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Zuckerberg promise to make a
commitment to a green energy

14:07.780 --> 14:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fund. Does that change this in
any way? Or is this something

14:11.617 --> 14:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the U.S. to trumpet? SETH
BORENSTEIN: This is something

14:16.289 --> 14:19.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite a bit different than in
previous years. You are seeing

14:19.859 --> 14:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- and this has happened in the
last couple of years, but it's

14:21.894 --> 14:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially happening now --
private industry money, business

14:26.399 --> 14:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- they're stepping up and
they're probably doing more than

14:30.903 --> 14:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many countries, and that's
helping. They're seeing sort of

14:34.640 --> 14:38.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the reality of the economics and
climate change. And they're

14:38.911 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, if we're going to -- if
you're going to do something,

14:41.180 --> 14:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let us volunteer, instead of you
impose, and let us help do

14:45.885 --> 14:49.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something with technology. So, I
mean, what you're looking at is

14:49.322 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both technology and business are
dramatically different than,

14:53.359 --> 14:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let's say, 1997 in Kyoto. Those
are two of the biggest reasons

14:57.530 --> 15:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why many people are optimistic
this time, because the

15:01.968 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology is so different, has
improved so much, and your --

15:05.338 --> 15:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the business community, much
of the business community is on

15:08.174 --> 15:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
board now. GWEN IFILL: Michael
Levi, I want to ask you about

15:10.643 --> 15:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two countries, not the U.S.,
involved in kind of whether this

15:14.413 --> 15:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will succeed or not. One is
China and the other is India.

15:17.850 --> 15:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you begin to take into
concern their concerns or their

15:22.221 --> 15:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
desire to make this happen or
stop it from happening? MICHAEL

15:25.458 --> 15:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEVI: Well, I think the China
front, at least when it comes to

15:28.828 --> 15:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the diplomacy, is relatively
bright. The United States tried

15:32.498 --> 15:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before the Copenhagen talks to
get on the same page with China,

15:36.335 --> 15:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but for the most part didn't
succeed, and the two countries

15:39.205 --> 15:42.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clashed sharply at the
Copenhagen summit. This time

15:42.308 --> 15:45.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around, they seem to be
considerably more successful.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They had an announcement last
year of mutual emissions-cutting

15:49.582 --> 15:53.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
targets. They had another this
year that put them on a similar

15:53.619 --> 15:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
page for the Paris summit.
Beijing is reacting to pressure

15:59.292 --> 16:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at home to cut local pollution,
and the desire from Xi Jinping

16:03.563 --> 16:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find an area where he can
work constructively with the

16:07.466 --> 16:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world's biggest power in order
to build a more positive story

16:11.003 --> 16:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of great power relations in the
21st century. So, there, even

16:14.407 --> 16:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though China has big challenges
in actually cutting emissions,

16:17.210 --> 16:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so does the United States,
the two have been able to get on

16:20.246 --> 16:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a similar diplomatic pledge.
They will clash a bit in public,

16:23.883 --> 16:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I think they have a script
in private. I think India is

16:26.385 --> 16:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tougher. India is a far poorer
country than China. It is a

16:30.656 --> 16:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country that is going through
enormous transition. It's

16:34.227 --> 16:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
impossible to predict what
Indian emissions or Indian

16:37.563 --> 16:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
energy use will be in 10 years
without policy, let alone to

16:40.933 --> 16:44.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make promises about what will
happen to them with policy. And

16:44.437 --> 16:47.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
India also guards its
independence jealously. Even if

16:47.406 --> 16:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it thinks it can cut emissions,
it's very wary of signing up on

16:50.610 --> 16:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deal to do that, a bit like a
lot of people in the United

16:53.212 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States. So, you will find India
is very sticky at these

16:57.149 --> 17:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
negotiations. It's tough often
to deal with. It won't promise

17:00.353 --> 17:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all that much. But on the
ground, in practice, it's likely

17:03.856 --> 17:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deliver considerably more.
GWEN IFILL: Seth Borenstein,

17:06.292 --> 17:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
briefly on that, to that same
point, especially on the India

17:08.895 --> 17:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point. SETH BORENSTEIN: Well,
actually, I think you can't say

17:12.031 --> 17:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough about China. China is the
-- we will get back to India in

17:15.334 --> 17:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a second, but China is the major
player here. They're the number

17:18.204 --> 17:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one carbon polluter by far. And
the difference between now and

17:22.541 --> 17:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Copenhagen is just night and
day. They are trying to be

17:26.178 --> 17:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaders in all sorts of things,
especially in solar technology.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they are one the reasons why
there are so many people

17:33.619 --> 17:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
optimistic. India is the reason
why there are some people who

17:37.423 --> 17:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are still afraid things might
fall apart, because India is one

17:41.460 --> 17:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of these countries that still
wants to talk about the

17:44.563 --> 17:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rich-poor divide. There are a
lot of poorer countries that

17:48.768 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue the discussion of
developed vs. developing world,

17:52.939 --> 17:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that helped cause problems
in Copenhagen. And they're

17:57.510 --> 18:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worried that this might crop up
now. And we're hearing little

18:01.314 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
glimmers of that here and there
now. GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, we

18:03.883 --> 18:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be watching all this very
closely... (CROSSTALK) GWEN

18:06.519 --> 18:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: ... as I'm sure you will
too. Seth Borenstein of the

18:09.455 --> 18:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Associated Press and Michael
Levi of the Council on Foreign

18:12.892 --> 18:17.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Relations, thank you both.
MICHAEL LEVI: Thank you. SETH

18:20.833 --> 18:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BORENSTEIN: My pleasure. GWEN
IFILL: Tonight, we begin a

18:28.174 --> 18:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week-long series on Africa's
most populous country, "Nigeria:

18:32.345 --> 18:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pain and Promise." Special
correspondent Nick Schifrin and

18:35.982 --> 18:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
producer and cameraman Zach
Fannin spent more than a month

18:39.118 --> 18:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the ground there, chronicling
a nation in the midst of an

18:42.121 --> 18:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encouraging and impressive
economic boom, but still plagued

18:45.958 --> 18:50.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by income inequality, corruption
and terrorism. This evening, we

18:50.229 --> 18:53.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look at the government's
attempts to wipe out Boko Haram,

18:53.232 --> 18:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a terrorist group that killed
more people in 2014 than the

18:57.303 --> 19:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State we hear so much
about. While the Nigerian

19:00.573 --> 19:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military has made significant
gains, the killings by the group

19:04.210 --> 19:08.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue. As we report, some
civilians are getting caught in

19:08.047 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the middle. A warning: Some of
the images in this report may be

19:12.084 --> 19:17.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disturbing. NICK SCHIFRIN: On
the outskirts of Maiduguri, the

19:17.189 --> 19:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
men who protect the city fight
with whatever they can find,

19:21.627 --> 19:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
40-year-old shotguns and iPhone
ear buds. Some carve their own

19:26.198 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clubs. Others patrol in floral
and kitchen knives. What they

19:31.804 --> 19:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lack in weaponry, they make up
for in divinely inspired

19:35.041 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidence. There's a couple of
shotguns. There's a few

19:37.043 --> 19:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
machetes, a few knives, but
that's it. ABBA AJI KALLI,

19:39.045 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Civilian JTF: Yes. NICK
SCHIFRIN: I mean, what would you

19:41.047 --> 19:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually be able to do if you
ran into Boko Haram out here?

19:43.215 --> 19:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We chased them out of
Maiduguri with stick and we

19:45.217 --> 19:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't even have a gun, and when
they have AK-47, they have RPG

19:51.023 --> 19:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on their hand, but we pushed
them out. ABBA AJI KALLI: God

19:54.627 --> 19:58.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has put the fear of the Civilian
JTF in their heart. Well done.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.533 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Fifty-one-year-old Abba Aji

20:00.566 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kalli leads the civil JTF, for
Joint Task Force. He used to be

20:03.969 --> 20:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a government auditor. Today,
he's more comfortable on the

20:06.505 --> 20:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front lines. If we kept walking
this way, where would we end up?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABBA AJI KALLI: If we kept
walking, we would end up in

20:11.944 --> 20:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sambisa. NICK SCHIFRIN: In
Sambisa forest, their

20:13.946 --> 20:16.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
headquarters? ABBA AJI KALLI: In
the forest is the Boko Haram

20:16.315 --> 20:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
headquarters. NICK SCHIFRIN:
Down this road? ABBA AJI KALLI:

20:18.317 --> 20:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Down this road. NICK SCHIFRIN:
His men called call him elder.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's him in dark gray on the
left. He and his vigilantes

20:23.456 --> 20:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
round up suspects using their
own brand of justice. Their

20:28.060 --> 20:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest fear, boys and girls
carrying bombs. ABBA AJI KALLI:

20:32.064 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are using females to come
and detonate their bomb attacks

20:35.901 --> 20:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on us. So, if you see anybody,
do not take chances. NICK

20:41.807 --> 20:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: Those bomb attacks are
Boko Haram's primary weapons. An

20:46.946 --> 20:49.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence official says the
groups detonated more bombs in

20:49.849 --> 20:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the last six months than the
previous six years. So many of

20:53.185 --> 20:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boko Haram's targets today are
soft, like this mosque. A man

20:58.090 --> 21:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walked in here pretty much to
where I'm standing and blew

21:01.760 --> 21:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself up as a group prayed.
The explosion was so powerful,

21:05.798 --> 21:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it obliterated the mosque's
roof. More than three-quarters

21:10.136 --> 21:14.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the victims are Muslim. And
these attacks are grisly. A few

21:14.106 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days after this one, and you can
still smell the blood that

21:17.843 --> 21:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stains the walls. Boko Haram
celebrates its attacks in slick,

21:26.152 --> 21:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIL-inspired propaganda. It
pledged allegiance to ISIL and

21:29.855 --> 21:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now calls itself the Islamic
State of West Africa. They

21:33.325 --> 21:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
embrace ISIL's brutality. Last
year, the group captured Mubi

21:38.898 --> 21:42.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and made the city its
administrative capital. Its

21:42.434 --> 21:45.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leader, Abubakar Shekau,
preached from a local mosque.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his fighters celebrated in
newly acquired Nigerian army

21:49.975 --> 21:53.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tanks. YA'U SA'EED, Nigeria:
Very, very dangerous for

21:53.379 --> 21:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone, because if you can see
the attacks, they have attacked

21:55.915 --> 21:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mosques, they have attacked
church, they have attacked

21:58.417 --> 22:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christians, they have attacked
Muslims. They are very

22:00.586 --> 22:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous. NICK SCHIFRIN: Ya'u
Sa'eed could be the most

22:03.656 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
courageous man in Mubi. When
Boko Haram arrived, he filmed

22:07.293 --> 22:10.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this video riding this
motorcycle into the stronghold

22:10.496 --> 22:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to rescue his mother. YA'U
SA'EED: I called my mom. She

22:13.232 --> 22:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, they're hearing the sound
of gunshots everywhere,

22:17.236 --> 22:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gunshots. YA'U SA'EED: He
witnessed an exodus, a city of

22:22.775 --> 22:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
140,000 people fleeing by any
means necessary. In total, more

22:27.580 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than two million people have
fled Boko Haram since the

22:30.316 --> 22:34.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fighting began. What did
Nigerian army soldiers do when

22:34.353 --> 22:36.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boko Haram attacked? YA'U
SA'EED: They do nothing. They

22:36.388 --> 22:38.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not do nothing when they
attacked Mubi. And that is

22:38.390 --> 22:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nobody, not any single person
have shot one single bullet.

22:42.494 --> 22:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But, today, the
Nigerian military is firing

22:49.368 --> 22:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back. It released this video
showing Boko Haram fighters

22:53.172 --> 22:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fleeing an air force attack. The
military success has redrawn the

22:57.543 --> 23:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
map. At its peak, Boko Haram
controlled an area the size of

23:01.380 --> 23:05.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Belgium. Now it controls only
three remote towns and a final

23:05.517 --> 23:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stronghold, the Sambisa forest.
Military spokesman Colonel Rabe

23:09.922 --> 23:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Abubakar says this year the
military's been transformed.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COL. RABE ABUBAKAR, Nigerian
Defense Force: There has been

23:15.995 --> 23:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tremendous change from what it
used to be until now, morale of

23:18.864 --> 23:22.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the troops, equipment,
leadership. There will never be

23:22.868 --> 23:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any territory that will fall
back to Boko Haram's insurgency.

23:27.206 --> 23:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Never again. NICK SCHIFRIN: Mubi
might be recaptured, but the

23:32.411 --> 23:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reconstruction has barely begun.
Bridges bombed by Boko Haram are

23:37.149 --> 23:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still broken. Street vendors use
burned-out cars as fruit stands.

23:42.688 --> 23:47.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many banks are still destroyed
and empty. Boko Haram looted the

23:47.893 --> 23:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cash to finance itself. Inside,
that red frame is all that's

23:53.432 --> 23:57.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left of the front door, those
papers all that's left of

23:57.136 --> 24:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
depositors' accounts. Outside
the nearby Church of the

24:01.206 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brethren, the damage is
everywhere. Inside, high above

24:05.377 --> 24:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the podium, the fire set by Boko
Haram almost erased the cross

24:09.281 --> 24:13.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the wall. Sixteen
parishioners died. Elia Usman is

24:13.585 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the church's secretary. ELIA
USMAN, Church of the Brethren:

24:15.587 --> 24:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When these people landed in
Mubi, they would ask you, are

24:18.891 --> 24:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you a Christian or a Muslim?
When you say you are a

24:22.861 --> 24:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christian, they will shoot you.
There's not one single church

24:26.165 --> 24:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left in Mubi. They bombed it.
NICK SCHIFRIN: But the streets

24:29.902 --> 24:34.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are busy. And those who fled
have returned, including Ya'u's

24:34.306 --> 24:38.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mother, Huraira Muhammad. Why do
you feel safe here? HURAIRA

24:38.744 --> 24:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MUHAMMAD, Nigeria: We are going
to the market. We are keeping on

24:41.880 --> 24:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with our lives. We are scared a
bit, but life must go on. KASHIM

24:45.584 --> 24:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHETTIMA, Borno State Governor:
We want everybody to go back to

24:48.487 --> 24:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his or her village. We will
provide all the arsenals at our

24:51.724 --> 24:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disposal. NICK SCHIFRIN: Borno
Governor Kashim Shettima leads

24:55.094 --> 24:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the state at the epicenter of
this war. He vows to force all

24:58.897 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
internally displaced people, or
IDPs, to return home by May.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KASHIM SHETTIMA: The population
of Maiduguri has snowballed. And

25:06.004 --> 25:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it a powder keg waiting to
explode. So, I think it's in our

25:08.006 --> 25:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enlightened self-interest to
expedite action in rebuilding

25:10.008 --> 25:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the homes once they are back in
their communities. At least

25:12.010 --> 25:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their kids can go to school. Now
we are really bringing up a

25:22.855 --> 25:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole generation of ignoramuses,
of idiots, illiterates. All our

25:27.926 --> 25:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools are closed. All our
schools have been converted into

25:31.597 --> 25:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IDP camps. NICK SCHIFRIN: There
is nowhere in the world with

25:35.334 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more children out of school. The
IDP camps are overflowing with

25:40.973 --> 25:46.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people and trauma. Hadiza is 17
years old. She was kidnapped by

25:46.879 --> 25:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boko Haram and held for nearly a
year. In this war, the spoils of

25:51.150 --> 25:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the battlefield are often girls.
HADIZA, Nigeria: They came and

25:55.087 --> 25:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said they wanted to marry me. I
wanted to know who I was going

25:59.658 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to marry. I didn't realize that
the one I was going to marry was

26:04.196 --> 26:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a member of Boko Haram. I didn't
know. By God, I didn't know he

26:08.767 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a member of Boko Haram. NICK
SCHIFRIN: Hadiza uses the word

26:12.638 --> 26:16.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marriage only out of shame. This
really isn't marriage, is it?

26:16.842 --> 26:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. GERIDA BIRUKILA, UNICEF: No,
it's rape. NICK SCHIFRIN: This

26:19.945 --> 26:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
woman is a UNICEF public health
specialist based in Maiduguri.

26:22.981 --> 26:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. GERIDA BIRUKILA: Some girls
were raped by different men. So,

26:26.285 --> 26:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we know that, in any religion or
any culture, that is not

26:29.254 --> 26:32.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marriage. NICK SCHIFRIN: But for
Hadiza and hundreds of other

26:32.958 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
girls, the impact is permanent.
She's six months' pregnant. And

26:38.096 --> 26:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what will you tell your child
about his or her father? HADIZA:

26:41.600 --> 26:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will -- my son that when Boko
Haram came, I met his dad. But I

26:47.272 --> 26:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
realized he wasn't a good
person. NICK SCHIFRIN: How

26:51.877 --> 26:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
traumatized are some of these
girls? DR. GERIDA BIRUKILA: We

26:55.180 --> 26:57.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have children who arrived, and
they lost their voice because of

26:57.916 --> 27:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they saw. They saw the
killings of their parents. They

27:01.320 --> 27:04.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
walked over dead bodies.
Although now they are safe, it

27:04.423 --> 27:07.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seems that the war still rages
in their minds. NICK SCHIFRIN:

27:07.960 --> 27:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boko Haram also kidnapped this
boy. He is scared they will kill

27:11.230 --> 27:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his family if he reveals his
identity. I asked him his age.

27:15.100 --> 27:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't know. BOY: They asked,
where is your father? They

27:19.438 --> 27:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked, if we taught you our
values, and you met with your

27:24.910 --> 27:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
father, would you kill him? NICK
SCHIFRIN: Boko Haram teachers

27:29.314 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tried to indoctrinate him. Had
they succeeded, he would have

27:32.417 --> 27:35.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ended up a suicide bomber, or
like this teenager in a Boko

27:35.687 --> 27:42.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Haram propaganda video.
TEENAGER: Turning to Allah is

27:42.194 --> 27:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not difficult. So come and
follow his path. NICK SCHIFRIN:

27:44.997 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were you convinced by what you
learned from Boko Haram's

27:48.767 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers? BOY: I didn't believe
what they said. How can I

27:53.105 --> 27:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe them when they're
killing people? ROBERTSON: When

27:55.674 --> 27:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he escaped, the military found
him and accused him of being a

27:58.944 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
militant. He says they left
these marks on his arms. BOY:

28:03.849 --> 28:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They tied up my arms with rope
from a well. MAN: All of them,

28:09.721 --> 28:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are Boko Haram members.
NICK SCHIFRIN: The military has

28:13.559 --> 28:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been accused of human rights
abuses and indiscriminate

28:16.194 --> 28:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrests. This video is from
2013. All the people rounded up

28:20.432 --> 28:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by soldiers were thrown into the
most notorious facility in the

28:23.802 --> 28:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
area, the army's Giwa barracks.
What is it like inside of Giwa

28:29.174 --> 28:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
barracks? This woman insists she
is not Boko Haram. She spent one

28:37.849 --> 28:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year inside Giwa barracks and
was never charged with anything.

28:41.420 --> 28:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: One of the female guards
was terrible. She doled out

28:45.691 --> 28:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perpetual beating and torture
that leads to death. NICK

28:49.161 --> 28:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: The army spokesman
didn't deny her allegations of

28:52.664 --> 28:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abuse. COL. RABE ABUBAKAR: It
could be that, yes, there could

28:56.168 --> 29:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be some isolated cases. But this
has been, in this dispensation,

29:01.139 --> 29:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this president's leadership,
the emphasis is anybody, any

29:06.979 --> 29:13.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
uniformed man who manhandled a
civilian anywhere either on the

29:13.485 --> 29:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war front or anywhere, please
report, and we will take

29:18.190 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appropriate action against that.
NICK SCHIFRIN: But it's not

29:20.459 --> 29:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear that's possible, when the
victims say they're threatened

29:23.562 --> 29:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into silence. Were you told
never to talk to anyone about

29:28.967 --> 29:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what happened to you in Giwa
barracks? WOMAN: They told us,

29:32.404 --> 29:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep your mouth shut. Don't talk
about anything you saw here.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Eventually,
Nigeria will win the battle

29:40.412 --> 29:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against Boko Haram, but the
years of torture, rape, and

29:44.650 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kidnapping leave open wounds.
The larger war won't be won

29:48.520 --> 29:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until those wounds are healed.

first, separating truth from

30:32.597 --> 30:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fiction in the race for the
White House. Political director

Lisa Desjardins reports. LISA
DESJARDINS: A candidate's words

30:40.105 --> 30:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
count. Or, at least, they're
supposed to. But as the

30:43.608 --> 30:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential campaign grinds on,
that rule is being severely

30:47.379 --> 30:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tested. Example: what Republican
Donald Trump said about a month

30:52.184 --> 30:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago on President Obama's plan to
resettle Syrian refugees on U.S.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
soil. DONALD TRUMP (R),
Presidential Candidate: And now

30:58.690 --> 31:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hear we want to take in
200,000 Syrians. LISA

31:01.293 --> 31:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESJARDINS: In fact, the actual
number is just 10,000. In

31:06.698 --> 31:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another incident last week,
Trump appeared to mock New York

31:10.502 --> 31:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Times reporter Serge Kovaleski
and his physical disability

31:13.505 --> 31:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during a campaign rally. DONALD
TRUMP: You got to see this guy.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, I don't know what I said.
Ah, I don't remember. LISA

31:20.178 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Asked about it
afterward, the candidate said,

31:22.814 --> 31:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"I certainly do not remember
him." In fact, Kovaleski says

31:26.918 --> 31:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they once knew each other on a
first-name basis. Rivals,

including Ohio Governor John
Kasich, point to Trump's words

31:34.192 --> 31:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

31:40.065 --> 31:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hispanics and mocking reporters,
then saying, I didn't do it, but

31:49.875 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weekend after touring Syrian
refugee camps in Jordan. He

31:55.147 --> 31:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offered this assessment on ABC:
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential

31:58.617 --> 32:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Candidate: We're hearing that
they all want to come here to

32:00.619 --> 32:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States up. And that's
not what they want. They want to

32:02.621 --> 32:04.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go back home. LISA DESJARDINS:
And this from Ted Cruz. He said

32:04.623 --> 32:07.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sunday that it's too early to
link anti-abortion rhetoric to

accuracy and truth can be

you just straight out whether it

32:50.001 --> 32:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of untruthfulness under way in
this campaign. TAMARA KEITH,

32:52.504 --> 32:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Public Radio: I think
that there is a backlash against

32:55.740 --> 32:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fact-checking that has -- that
started in 2012 and has really

32:59.811 --> 33:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken hold. And I think that you
can attribute this to a couple

33:03.481 --> 33:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of things. One, I think the
public generally believes

33:06.718 --> 33:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politicians are going to lie on
some level, and so truth is a

33:10.822 --> 33:17.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fuzzy thing in campaign
politics. And, two, the public

33:17.329 --> 33:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't really believe the
media. Something like 60 percent

33:20.832 --> 33:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people polled say that they
don't trust the news media to

33:25.937 --> 33:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accurately and fairly report the
news. Well, if people don't

33:30.275 --> 33:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trust us to accurately and
fairly report the news, then

33:34.579 --> 33:38.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fact-checking -- then the
candidates have very little to

33:38.149 --> 33:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fear. GWEN IFILL: Here is what
puzzles me. People have access

33:40.752 --> 33:44.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to information unfiltered by the
media more so than ever before,

33:44.956 --> 33:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, yet, somehow, when you
confront somebody -- like,

33:48.260 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, Chris Christie, the
former governor of New Jersey,

33:50.262 --> 33:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that Donald Trump's claims
that there were Muslims

33:53.832 --> 33:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
celebrating in New Jersey after
9/11 were not true, that it

33:57.569 --> 34:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't happen. And Donald
Trump's response is, yes, it

34:01.506 --> 34:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did. AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Right. So how

34:03.508 --> 34:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to you refute that?
And you say, well, as we have

34:05.777 --> 34:09.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen journalists do, show us the
proof of it. Well, I know it's

34:09.614 --> 34:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proof because I have heard
people tell me that it was the

34:12.050 --> 34:14.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
truth. Where's the
documentation? GWEN IFILL:

34:14.352 --> 34:17.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because I told them. AMY WALTER:
Because I told them. It goes

34:17.522 --> 34:19.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to something that Tamara
said too. It's not only that

34:19.524 --> 34:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people don't trust that the
media is telling them the truth.

34:21.526 --> 34:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's that everybody has their
own definition of what the media

34:23.795 --> 34:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is and what truth is. And if you
live in a silo, which more and

34:27.899 --> 34:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more Americans now are living in
these siloed sort of realities

34:32.137 --> 34:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of they get their news from
sources that agree with them.

34:36.041 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They listen to people who agree
with them. They unfriend people

34:40.412 --> 34:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Facebook who disagree with
them. Then all you're doing most

34:44.749 --> 34:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of your day is getting your
world view just told back to you

34:49.955 --> 34:53.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you're never challenged on
it. So, of course it's -- how

34:53.458 --> 34:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can you tell me that my truth
isn't my truth? TAMARA KEITH:

34:56.161 --> 34:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, and you take the Trump
9/11 rumor. Well, if you go

34:59.064 --> 35:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
search on the Internet -- you
want to be unfiltered, go search

35:01.566 --> 35:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Internet, you can find
lots of Web sites that for years

35:05.737 --> 35:08.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have been spreading that
Internet rumor. GWEN IFILL: OK,

35:08.673 --> 35:12.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so this interesting, because we
have always known that people

35:12.077 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that the media might not
be telling the truth or that

35:14.646 --> 35:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politicians are not telling the
truth. But now we seemed to have

35:16.982 --> 35:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reached another level. So,
today, we saw kind of another

35:20.285 --> 35:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spectacle in the lobby of the
Trump Tower, where Donald Trump

35:23.254 --> 35:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
met with black clergy, some of
whom had already supported him,

35:27.292 --> 35:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but many of who hadn't, and the
Trump folks had said it was

35:30.762 --> 35:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be an endorsement. It
kind of wasn't. What was it? AMY

35:34.232 --> 35:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER: Well, he said it was --
I don't -- like most of this

35:37.335 --> 35:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign, I don't think we
really know what this was. GWEN

35:39.771 --> 35:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Yes. AMY WALTER: What it
started out was, was as an

35:42.407 --> 35:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attempt for Donald Trump to talk
about something else, which is

35:45.844 --> 35:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's very good at doing, which
is, as soon as he gets

35:48.246 --> 35:50.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticism, let's go and change
the subject. In this case, I

35:50.448 --> 35:55.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think the subject being he's
racist, he's making statements

35:55.820 --> 36:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about people that are over the
top. OK, I will show you, says

36:00.058 --> 36:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump. I'm going to bring
together all these black clergy

36:02.327 --> 36:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are going to endorse me,
until it turns out that they

36:04.896 --> 36:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, well, actually, we're not
here to endorse you. We thought

36:07.499 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we were invited to just talk to
you. Then Donald Trump changes

36:11.036 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his tune and says, well, maybe
it's just a meeting. GWEN IFILL:

36:13.038 --> 36:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, let's talking about a real
endorsement that did happen.

36:15.206 --> 36:18.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chris Christie, who has been
struggling in this campaign, but

36:18.510 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he got the endorsement of The
New Hampshire Union Leader, the

36:21.112 --> 36:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state's largest newspaper.
TAMARA KEITH: He did. And this

36:24.482 --> 36:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has proven helpful for other
candidates in the past. They

36:27.752 --> 36:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have gotten a boost in their
poll numbers. GWEN IFILL: You

36:31.556 --> 36:33.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean President Gingrich?
(LAUGHTER) TAMARA KEITH: Yes,

36:33.658 --> 36:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly. Now, Gingrich was the
one that -- it hasn't been a

36:37.629 --> 36:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
great predictor of the next
nominee or the next president of

36:43.968 --> 36:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States. But here's
Chris Christie. He's basically

36:47.138 --> 36:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken up residence in New
Hampshire. He's betting his

36:49.140 --> 36:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole game on winning in New
Hampshire and then having

36:51.142 --> 36:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something to propel him forward.
When you're at 5 percent, you

36:53.144 --> 36:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will take whatever you can get.
It's not a negative. GWEN IFILL:

36:56.314 --> 37:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OK. AMY WALTER: Yes. I mean, New
Hampshire is notorious for doing

37:00.051 --> 37:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a couple of things, one, for
being the counterweight to Iowa.

37:05.190 --> 37:08.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what Iowa does, they sort of
pick the opposite of that, and

37:08.560 --> 37:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
witting until the last minute.
Most than half of the voters in

37:11.629 --> 37:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the 2008, 2012 campaign decided
in the last week of the election

37:17.569 --> 37:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who they were voting for. For
Chris Christie, look, this gives

37:20.505 --> 37:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him a good talking point to say,
it matters that I have stayed

37:23.775 --> 37:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here. I have put residence
basically down in the state,

37:27.812 --> 37:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even though I'm supposed to be
governor of New Jersey. But it

37:30.982 --> 37:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also shows how wide open the
so-called establishment side of

37:36.654 --> 37:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the equation is. GWEN IFILL:
Right. AMY WALTER: This is the

37:40.692 --> 37:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
key for this campaign. We know
that there is the Donald Trump

37:44.028 --> 37:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factor, and he has consolidated
his support. He has about 25

37:46.097 --> 37:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent. The problem is, there
is no anti-Trump that's

37:48.099 --> 37:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consolidated on the other side.
GWEN IFILL: Now, as

37:50.101 --> 37:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unpredictable as this election
has been, one of the predictable

37:52.103 --> 37:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that Ben Carson did this
weekend was, what happens when

37:54.639 --> 37:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you don't have any international
experience? You go -- you take a

37:57.475 --> 38:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreign trip, and he went to
Jordan. TAMARA KEITH: He did.

38:00.211 --> 38:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he met with Syrian refugees
in refugee camps in Jordan. He

38:04.249 --> 38:07.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came out of it, I think, with
the same conclusion that he went

38:08.019 --> 38:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into it with, was that -- which
was that there are other ways to

38:11.723 --> 38:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal with refugees from Syria
than to bring them to America.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said that they don't want to
come to America, they want to go

38:18.329 --> 38:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to Syria. And I'm sure many
people will say, I want to go

38:21.633 --> 38:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home. I want to be able to go
home. So he went in, he went to

38:25.837 --> 38:29.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jordan. He did what many past
presidential candidates have

38:29.274 --> 38:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done with mixed records. I don't
know that it changed anything.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I don't -- I
still think the questions were

38:35.246 --> 38:40.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raised in his Sunday talk show
interviews about, well, OK, what

38:40.351 --> 38:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is your strategy then for the
war in Syria, for the war

38:44.756 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against ISIS? And it still was
as vague as it has always been,

38:48.359 --> 38:52.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so it's not as if he brought
with him any more specifics. And

38:52.330 --> 38:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is still his biggest
problem. GWEN IFILL: And,

38:54.632 --> 38:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
finally, we of course heard --
every now and then, life or news

38:58.403 --> 39:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interferes in the campaign. And
in this case, the issues of guns

39:03.141 --> 39:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and abortion, both hot-button
issues in a Republican primary

39:06.377 --> 39:09.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially, but also on the
Democratic side, came together

39:09.180 --> 39:12.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Planned Parenthood
shootings in Colorado. We didn't

39:12.283 --> 39:14.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hear from Republicans for a
while. We heard from Democrats

39:14.619 --> 39:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right away linking the two. What
did they -- how did they handle

39:19.324 --> 39:22.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that? AMY WALTER: Well, it's
become almost so predictable. If

39:22.827 --> 39:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have guns and abortion or
any other cultural issue, it

39:26.864 --> 39:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hits the media, it hits Twitter,
it hits Facebook, and,

39:29.901 --> 39:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instantly, each side goes into
its camp, and they make

39:33.238 --> 39:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assumptions about what happened,
they make accusations, and

39:38.176 --> 39:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everybody just sort of gets in
their camp on this side, gets in

39:41.346 --> 39:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their camp on that side. We
retain our silos through the

39:44.749 --> 39:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end. TAMARA KEITH: Yes. Watching
this play out on Twitter, it

39:47.085 --> 39:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, like, ah, we're in America
and America is deeply, deeply,

39:51.322 --> 39:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deeply divided. GWEN IFILL: And
until there is actually a court

39:54.692 --> 39:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appearance or something else,
and we still don't know -- we

39:57.528 --> 40:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end up where we started. Who

(CROSSTALK) AMY WALTER: Yes.
GWEN IFILL: Amy Walter -- there

40:02.734 --> 40:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used to be rules. Amy Walter of
The Cook Political Report,

40:05.637 --> 40:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tamara Keith of NPR, thank you
both very. TAMARA KEITH: You're

40:14.712 --> 40:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
welcome. GWEN IFILL: In just a
few minutes, we will be back

40:23.888 --> 40:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a look at how a boxer is
working to reduce violence in

40:27.625 --> 40:31.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baltimore. But, first, take this
moment to hear from your local

40:31.162 --> 40:34.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PBS station. It's a chance to
offer your support, which helps

40:34.599 --> 40:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep programs like ours on the
air. (BREAK) In Baltimore today,

40:55.086 --> 41:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jury selection began in the
first trial against six police

41:41.265 --> 41:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officers related to the death of
Freddie Gray. A small group of

42:36.654 --> 42:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protesters demonstrated outside
the courthouse, in a city that

42:46.497 --> 42:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still healing. One church in
the Cherry Hill neighborhood is

46:37.695 --> 46:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offering a unique ministry. A
version of this piece was

47:04.555 --> 47:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
originally produced by the PBS
program "Religion &amp; Ethics

47:31.816 --> 47:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Newsweekly." MIKE MOSLEY, Head
Coach, Cross for Christ Boxing

47:59.043 --> 48:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gym: My name is Mike Mosley. I'm
the head coach of Cross for

48:16.694 --> 48:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christ here at Created For So
Much More Worship Center. All

48:21.265 --> 48:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, you all get in the line
and look at this mirror. Bend at

48:24.201 --> 48:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your knees. Good. That's good. I
enjoyed fighting. Never was a

48:28.372 --> 48:33.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bully. So, I was talking to my
cousin one day. He said, you

48:33.778 --> 48:39.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, they recently opened up a
boxing gym in the area. Put this

48:39.049 --> 48:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fist up. Always protect home.
Your face is home. BISHOP

48:42.887 --> 48:46.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLARD SAUNDERS, Created For So
Much More Worship Center: The

48:47.024 --> 48:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
boxing program has become a
medium that is a part of our

48:49.026 --> 48:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ministry to help children, young
men and women, to be able to

48:51.028 --> 48:53.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reach their own potential
through an activity that creates

48:53.798 --> 48:56.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
discipline. MIKE MOSLEY: How you
all late again? BISHOP WILLARD

48:56.667 --> 49:00.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAUNDERS: And also creates
commitment. MIKE MOSLEY: Six

49:00.271 --> 49:02.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
o'clock. Six o'clock. Six
o'clock. BISHOP WILLARD

49:02.373 --> 49:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAUNDERS: And it really helps us
to be able to minister to them.

49:06.243 --> 49:09.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not even separate from our
ministry. It is our ministry.

49:09.647 --> 49:12.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have been able for the
past several years to see the

49:12.283 --> 49:15.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
great success that it's had to
be able to get kids who would be

49:15.386 --> 49:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
involved in violence in some
sort of way out on the street to

49:19.523 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now come to the boxing gym and
be able to learn and to learn

49:23.194 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the skill of boxing and also get
the word of God at the same

49:26.831 --> 49:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time. MIKE MOSLEY: I haven't
even lived a life half as rough

49:30.401 --> 49:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as some of these kids. Every
minute that a kid is in this

49:35.472 --> 49:39.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gym, every evening that a kid is
in this gym, they are in a safe

49:39.043 --> 49:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
zone. Jab your way in there.
There you go. There you go. They

49:44.448 --> 49:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are protected. I like that.
ISAIAH ROBINSON, Boxing Student:

49:48.185 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boxing isn't about anger or
violence. It is more about

49:52.323 --> 49:57.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technique and flow. It lets me
reach myself. It keeps me out of

49:57.728 --> 50:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the streets. It keeps me busy.
ASANTE TATE, Boxing Student:

50:02.132 --> 50:08.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Boxing is not about aggression
at all. It made me humble as a

50:08.072 --> 50:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young teen. It kind of took me
away from the immaturity and

50:13.944 --> 50:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside of the gym, and kind of
brung me closer to, you know,

50:19.116 --> 50:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different people. And it kind of
-- it made me see the world a

50:24.655 --> 50:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
different way. When I came in
here, like, I felt like I

50:28.492 --> 50:33.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
belonged here, like I actually
became a part of this family.

50:33.464 --> 50:38.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE MOSLEY: My hope for the
kids is just to awaken something

50:38.269 --> 50:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in them that can't be put to
sleep. One of the first kids

50:44.408 --> 50:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I worked with and helped
with skills Dante (ph) become an

50:52.583 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assistant coach. To see a kid
who used to be on the street

50:56.220 --> 51:00.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making money in ways that
weren't legal, to see him

51:00.958 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working with the kids and
spending his time and giving

51:04.094 --> 51:07.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them his gifts, his
intelligence, his skills, his

51:07.998 --> 51:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
savvy, and really enjoying doing
that, that just makes me

51:11.802 --> 51:15.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ecstatic, because that is what
it's about. BISHOP WILLARD

51:15.306 --> 51:19.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAUNDERS: Children in this
community don't know what

51:19.109 --> 51:21.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
success looks like. They don't
know what love and discipline

51:21.111 --> 51:23.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look like together. They don't
know life. They don't know

51:23.113 --> 51:26.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
death. They don't understand the
consequences of it, because that

51:26.583 --> 51:30.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
piece of it has been missing.
Boxing doesn't just teach you

51:30.154 --> 51:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respect for your ability, but
respect for your opponent. You

51:34.191 --> 51:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be defeated. They learn what
it feels like to fail in the

51:37.728 --> 51:40.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
boxing gym, but they learn how
much harder they have got to go

51:40.798 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back and work around come back
and be successful and to be able

51:44.501 --> 51:47.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work at it. That gives you a
respect for life. It also gives

51:47.871 --> 51:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you a respect for death. And it
gives you, more importantly, a

51:50.841 --> 51:53.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respect for yourself and for
other human beings. MIKE MOSLEY:

51:53.544 --> 51:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have a lot of dreams for this
gym, but my real dream and my

51:58.315 --> 52:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real hope is just for the kids.
This gym is my everything. In

52:00.317 --> 52:02.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life, there is so much
temptation. There's so much bad

52:02.319 --> 52:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out there, that it's hard to
know that you're doing the right

52:04.321 --> 52:09.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing. I know 100 percent of the
time when I'm in the gym is the

52:16.333 --> 52:21.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right thing. And there's a
freedom in that. GWEN IFILL: On

the "NewsHour" online right now:
It's the 115th anniversary of

53:10.788 --> 53:14.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the death of Oscar Wilde. One of
the wittiest people of his day,

53:14.425 --> 53:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Irish writer died at age 46.
But what did he die of? it's

53:19.129 --> 53:22.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably not what most people
believe. Read that and more on
