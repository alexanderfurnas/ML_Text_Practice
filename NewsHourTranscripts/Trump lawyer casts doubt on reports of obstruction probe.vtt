JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
continues to be nagged by
possible links between Russia

00:05.466 --> 00:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his associates and questions
over whether Mr. Trump has tried
to shut down that investigation.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, the Russia story
took another turn when reports
surfaced that special counsel

00:17.533 --> 00:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robert Mueller is investigating
the president himself.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I spoke a short while
ago to Jay Sekulow.

00:21.700 --> 00:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a member of President
Trump's legal team and chief
counsel for the American Center

00:26.600 --> 00:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Law and Justice.

00:29.233 --> 00:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking if
the special counsel has
informed Mr. Trump that
he's under investigation.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW, Attorney For
Donald Trump: No, he has not.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been no information
given by the special counsel
informing the president that

00:39.066 --> 00:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he is under investigation.

00:40.066 --> 00:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been consistent.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, we have received nothing
about an investigation of the
president of the United States.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you
acknowledged yesterday,
it is possible that
the president could be

00:50.033 --> 00:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under investigation and
just simply not have been
informed by it -- about it.

00:54.566 --> 00:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, I mean,
but here's the reality.

00:57.033 --> 00:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not something
that's happened in a vacuum.

00:59.533 --> 01:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- there's
been discussions about
this Russian probe and
committees of the Congress

01:03.466 --> 01:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at this for nine months,
with -- producing no evidence
about Russian collusion.

01:07.466 --> 01:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, while it's true I can't
read the mind of a special
counsel, we have received no

01:14.433 --> 01:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
notification of an investigation
or a pending investigation or
a preliminary investigation

01:19.066 --> 01:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or anything else.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I can say is what we
know is the president right
now is not investigation,

01:26.066 --> 01:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not been investigation,
and is not under investigation.

01:28.133 --> 01:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you saying
the stories that have been
printed in The Washington Post

01:31.666 --> 01:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and other news
organizations are false?

01:33.700 --> 01:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAY SEKULOW: Well,
The Washington Post
story was based on five
anonymous sources where

01:39.666 --> 01:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they didn't even
identify the agency.

01:42.066 --> 01:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have that report coming
out from The Washington Post
which I believe is false.

01:46.733 --> 01:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the -- ABC reported
that they had received from
their sources information that

01:51.700 --> 01:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact the special
counsel had not opened an
investigation of the president.

01:56.500 --> 02:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, again, I don't know
where these sources are
coming from, but we have
not had any information

02:04.066 --> 02:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the special counsel
or anyone else, for that
matter, that the president
is under investigation.

02:06.100 --> 02:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, setting
that aside, when the president
told Lester Holt a few weeks

02:10.866 --> 02:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago at that interview that he
had what he called the Russia
thing on his mind when he

02:18.266 --> 02:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired then FBI Director
James Comey and when
he said to Russian
diplomats around the same

02:23.000 --> 02:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time that it relieved pressure
on him to fire James Comey,
what was he referring to?

02:28.166 --> 02:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, the president
engaged in a deliberative
process that went on for a

02:31.400 --> 02:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of weeks evaluating
the performance of James Comey
as the FBI director, and that

02:38.366 --> 02:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
culminated in a number of
discussions that took place
within the White House.

02:40.933 --> 02:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, the attorney
general of the United
States and the deputy
attorney general recommended

02:44.566 --> 02:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the president the
removal of James Comey, and
James Comey was removed.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, that's just fact.

02:51.666 --> 02:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What other thoughts the
president had going into that,
how long he'd been considering,

02:55.266 --> 02:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I wasn't privy to that,
but normal deliberative
process and they look
at a variety of issues.

02:59.866 --> 03:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regarding the Russia
situation, I would like to
say something, Judy, here.

03:06.000 --> 03:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look, this is a bit
of a witch-hunt.

03:06.933 --> 03:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It really is a witch-hunt.

03:08.966 --> 03:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This investigation from the
Congress has been going for nine
months into this Russia probe.

03:13.266 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And members of the Senate
and House from right,
left and center said
so far there's been no

03:17.600 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
evidence of collusion.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the intelligence officers
were asked, is there evidence
of collusion on this, no

03:22.866 --> 03:24.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
evidence of collusion.

03:24.766 --> 03:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We didn't include evidence
because we haven't
seen that evidence.

03:27.333 --> 03:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a situation
that I think is basically
like a factual scenario
that's almost being

03:33.700 --> 03:35.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made up.

03:35.766 --> 03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president is responding
the way presidents respond, in
that this is not consuming his

03:39.333 --> 03:40.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not consuming an hour.

03:42.166 --> 03:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's trying to and is
successfully governing.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think what we have
to look at, there is
now a special counsel.

03:48.266 --> 03:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The special counsel will
evaluate whatever the
special counsel evaluates.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the American people are
being penalized in this as well.

03:55.533 --> 03:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it continues to drag on.

03:56.966 --> 03:57.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:57.966 --> 03:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Yes, go ahead.

03:59.266 --> 04:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let
me just step in here.

04:00.566 --> 04:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You -- the president's
called it a witch-hunt.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have said it's a witch-hunt.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And yet you have said
it should go forward.

04:05.933 --> 04:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you believe, if the president
believes it's a witch-hunt,
does he believe that the

04:09.666 --> 04:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole thing should stop, that
the special counsel, Robert
Mueller, should step aside

04:13.966 --> 04:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and either let somebody else
take this over or just say,
I'm not going to do this?

04:20.966 --> 04:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, now, the
president hasn't said that the
special counsel can't do his

04:23.633 --> 04:25.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president has said
consistently is - - in fact,
when he -- in that Lester Holt

04:28.466 --> 04:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
interview, if you
remember, if you look
at the full transcript,
he acknowledged that,

04:32.100 --> 04:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by firing James Comey and
removing him from the director
of the FBI, that it would extend

04:36.833 --> 04:37.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this investigation.

04:37.833 --> 04:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: He said that.

04:40.366 --> 04:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he knew the consequence,
so to speak, of his action.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He took the action because
he thought it was in the best
interest of the United States,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as did his attorney
general and deputy attorney
general and others.

04:47.033 --> 04:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that we're -- when
I say the phrase witch-hunt,
when the president is talking

04:51.333 --> 04:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a witch-hunt, this whole
frenzy that developed and,
again, with everybody coming

04:55.800 --> 04:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward on all of these
committees says so far they have
seen nothing in, like I said,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an investigation
going on nine months.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the special counsel
has been appointed.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the special counsel will
ultimately do their job.

05:05.533 --> 05:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of that special
counsel's job, we will see
that there is nothing against

05:10.066 --> 05:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president, as I
suspected the entire time.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think the legal
team without question
is confident of that.

05:16.200 --> 05:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Judy, the witch-hunt aspect
of this is just the nature of
what's going on with multiple

05:20.800 --> 05:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committees simultaneously,
now a special counsel.

05:23.833 --> 05:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what else are you going
to add to the mix to make it?

05:27.033 --> 05:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, when you have
a special counsel and you have
those committees going, as you

05:30.833 --> 05:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know -- you have been watching
it a long time - - when you
have those going simultaneously,

05:34.500 --> 05:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it raises a whole host of issues
of conflicts and everything
else that are going to have

05:37.966 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be looked at.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
two quick questions.

05:41.266 --> 05:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president believes this
is a witch-hunt, if you and his
other attorneys believe that,

05:44.733 --> 05:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and yet, at the same
time, you're saying the
probe should go forward,
there is a contradiction

05:50.833 --> 05:53.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you saying it should
go forward unfettered, that
there will be cooperation
from the president?

05:56.266 --> 05:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Or are you saying there
is going to be some
kind of resistance
because you think it's

05:59.133 --> 06:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an illegitimate investigation?

06:01.300 --> 06:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, look, the
president has said that --
has given no indication that

06:05.433 --> 06:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's not going to
cooperate, if there's
anything to cooperate on.

06:08.500 --> 06:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, let me be clear on that,
because you raise a really
important point, and that is

06:13.000 --> 06:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is multiple aspects
to this Russian probe,
as it has been described.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we will -- the
president is not saying
stop the Russian probe.

06:21.266 --> 06:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The witch-hunt aspect of
this is this media-created
frenzy of unnamed sources
saying it's targeting

06:28.533 --> 06:30.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

06:30.566 --> 06:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, then you
had the contradictory source
from ABC saying it wasn't.

06:34.200 --> 06:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is the
witch-hunt aspect of
this, leaking information.

06:38.333 --> 06:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agents -- I mean, how
does it make the American
people feel that supposed
investigators involved

06:42.533 --> 06:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in this Russian probe
are leaking information
anonymously without even
defining what agency

06:46.900 --> 06:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're from to The
Washington Post?

06:48.733 --> 06:50.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That shouldn't be OK.

06:50.766 --> 06:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shouldn't be any more
OK than James Comey doing
the same thing, by the way.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:55.166 --> 06:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I believe you
have acknowledged the fact that
the president did fire James

06:57.300 --> 07:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey, the FBI director, who
at that time was overseeing
this investigation, the fact

07:01.000 --> 07:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the president made those
comments to Lester Holt, to
the Russian diplomats about

07:05.900 --> 07:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relieving pressure, the
appearance is that the president
wanted to do what he could to

07:10.200 --> 07:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get this investigation
off his back.

JAY SEKULOW: I think --
I don't think that's at
all what the case is.

07:15.233 --> 07:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think the president
removed James Comey for
a number of reasons.

07:19.133 --> 07:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, many left of center were
calling for the removal of
James Comey just about a year

07:23.833 --> 07:24.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

07:24.833 --> 07:25.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

07:25.833 --> 07:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

07:28.300 --> 07:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said the
reason was, at least
what he told Lester Holt,
was the Russia thing

07:33.166 --> 07:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was on his mind when
he fired James Comey.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Well, but look
at -- when you say the Russian
thing is on his mind, look

07:38.266 --> 07:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the way the probe was
handled on Hillary Clinton.

07:40.700 --> 07:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This was an individual,
James Comey, who didn't
handle a very important
investigation properly.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And left, right and center
have acknowledged it.

07:49.066 --> 07:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the president was
talking about the way the Russia
probe is, that, as it moves

07:51.800 --> 07:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward, it is handled
properly, not the way it was
handled under James Comey.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jay Sekulow,
representing President
Trump, thank you very much.

07:59.833 --> 08:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW: Thanks, Judy.
