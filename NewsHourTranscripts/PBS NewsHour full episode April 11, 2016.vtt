JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away this week.

00:08.041 --> 00:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Presidential contenders
try to make it in New York, as
Bernie Sanders

00:13.947 --> 00:18.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wins his seventh straight
matchup over Hillary
Clinton.

00:18.285 --> 00:24.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: inside Kenya and the
country's rampant
corruption, where police bribe,
instead of

00:24.558 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patrol, and nearly a billion
dollars of government
money goes missing.

00:28.795 --> 00:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The wealth gap
here makes the
corruption more egregious.
According to one

00:33.967 --> 00:37.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study, Kenyans pay on average 16
bribes every
month.

00:37.571 --> 00:44.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the legacy of
Jackie Robinson.
A new Ken Burns PBS documentary
tracks the

00:44.478 --> 00:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icon's journey from baseball
hero to civil
rights champion.

00:49.816 --> 00:56.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.757 --> 00:59.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.559 --> 01:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is a rare
week without
any primary voting anywhere, in
the 2016 presidential

01:10.737 --> 01:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race, but the campaigning grinds
on. And,
as the day's developments show,
the talk is

01:16.109 --> 01:21.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting testier, especially over
the all-important
delegate numbers game.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our report.

01:23.150 --> 01:27.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: For the two
Democratic contenders
and the three Republicans, the
campaign is

01:27.154 --> 01:34.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now dominated by delegate wars.
GOP front-runner
Donald Trump leads by about 200
delegates.

01:34.261 --> 01:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he phoned into FOX News this
morning to
complain that his lead should be
even bigger.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
As an example, South Carolina, I
won it by

01:41.268 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a landslide, like a massive
landslide. And
now they're trying to pick off
those delegates

01:45.372 --> 01:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one by one. That's not the way
democracy is
supposed to work. What kind of a
system is

01:49.343 --> 01:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this? Now, I'm an outsider, and
I came into
the system, and I'm winning the
votes by millions

01:54.715 --> 01:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of votes. But the system is
rigged. It's crooked.

01:56.783 --> 02:03.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Adding to Trump's
frustration,
rival Ted Cruz's sweep of
Colorado's 34 delegates

02:03.190 --> 02:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the weekend. Today, the
Texas senator
turned to California. Its June 7
primary is

02:09.529 --> 02:15.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suddenly vital in the race,
offering the single
biggest delegate prize for
Republicans: 172.

02:15.402 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
California is going to decide
the Republican

02:19.373 --> 02:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination for president. And if
we continue
to unite, we will win the
general election,

02:25.812 --> 02:29.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beat Hillary Clinton and turn
this country
around!

02:29.116 --> 02:30.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:30.984 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tensions are also
rising on the
Democratic side, now that Bernie
Sanders has

02:34.554 --> 02:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
won seven of the last eight
contests.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Binghamton, New York today,
he went after
Hillary Clinton on oil and gas
drilling.

02:41.995 --> 02:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
On this issue of fracking,
Secretary Clinton

02:46.199 --> 02:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I have some very strong
differences of
opinion. If we are serious about
combating

02:52.472 --> 02:58.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change, we need to put
an end to fracking,
not only in New York and
Vermont, but all

02:58.478 --> 03:01.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over this country.

03:01.615 --> 03:06.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: People in the Sanders
crowd booed
the mention of Clinton's name.
She took her

03:06.987 --> 03:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
own shots at a stop in Queens.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I have noticed that under the
bright spotlight

03:12.692 --> 03:16.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and scrutiny of New York,
Senator Sanders
has had trouble answering
questions. He's

03:16.329 --> 03:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had trouble answering questions
about his
core issue, namely, dealing with
the banks.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's had trouble answering
foreign policy
questions.

03:24.871 --> 03:29.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton still enjoys
a wide lead
in delegates, but Sanders
insists he can narrow

03:29.643 --> 03:30.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the gap.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:33.380 --> 03:39.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: British
prime Minister David Cameron
rejected criticism

03:39.286 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his family's finances and
offshore holdings.
He's come under fire after the
Panama Papers

03:44.925 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leak detailed his late father's
investments.

03:48.195 --> 03:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Parliament today, Cameron
said his
father's investment fund was
designed to help

03:53.400 --> 03:55.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investors, not to dodge taxes.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: We
should differentiate between
schemes designed

03:58.605 --> 04:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to artificially reduce tax and
those that
are encouraging investment. Mr.
Speaker, this

04:04.177 --> 04:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a government and this should
be a country
that believes in aspiration and
wealth creation.

04:09.382 --> 04:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we should -- we should defend
the right
of every British citizen to make
money lawfully.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aspiration and wealth creation
are not somehow
dirty words.

04:19.292 --> 04:24.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cameron initially
refused to
say if he had a stake in his
father's business,

04:24.164 --> 04:30.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he now acknowledges selling
his shares
before his election as prime
minister in 2010.

04:30.237 --> 04:35.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, a surge in fighting
now threatens
to derail a month-old
cease-fire. It's focused

04:36.076 --> 04:41.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around Aleppo, the country's
largest city.
Half of it is held by rebels.
Syrian army

04:41.748 --> 04:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
video showed artillery firing on
rebel positions
on Sunday. There's also word
that government

04:47.954 --> 04:54.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reinforcements are moving in to
counter a
buildup of Islamist militants
linked to al-Qaida.

04:55.028 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A fragile truce also hung in the
balance in
Yemen today, amid sporadic
violations. The

05:01.201 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fire took hold last night
between Shiite
rebels and a Saudi-led coalition
that backs

05:06.940 --> 05:12.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government. The year-long
conflict has
killed more than 9,000 people,
and forced

05:12.412 --> 05:16.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nearly 2.5 million to flee.

05:16.483 --> 05:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators in Southern India
are hunting
suspects after an illegal
fireworks display

05:21.354 --> 05:28.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sets off a deadly fire. At least
110 people
died and another 380 were hurt
in Sunday's

05:28.295 --> 05:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blaze at a Hindu temple. Amateur
video captured
explosions that rocked the
village of Paravoor,

05:34.968 --> 05:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as revelers celebrated the Hindu
new year.
Thousands of people were packed
inside the

05:40.907 --> 05:42.576 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
complex.

05:42.676 --> 05:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Kerry became the first U.S.
secretary
of state to visit Hiroshima,
Japan, where

05:48.081 --> 05:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb
in 1945. Kerry
toured the Hiroshima Peace
Museum and Memorial

05:55.622 --> 05:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he attended a seven-nation
conference.
He spoke to reporters afterward.

05:59.859 --> 06:07.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It is
a gut-wrenching display. It tugs
at all of

06:08.001 --> 06:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your sensibilities as a human
being. It reminds
everybody of the extraordinary
complexity

06:18.478 --> 06:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of choices in war, and of what
war does to
people, to communities, to
countries, to the

06:25.885 --> 06:27.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

06:27.854 --> 06:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kerry didn't say
whether President
Obama will visit Hiroshima when
he travels

06:31.091 --> 06:33.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Japan in late May.

06:33.393 --> 06:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A sign today that the flow of
migrants from
Turkey into Greece is finally
slowing. Greek

06:39.065 --> 06:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials say only 18 people
landed on outlying
islands in the last 24 hours.
Meanwhile, thousands

06:46.406 --> 06:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remain in camps near the border
with Macedonia.
A tense calm returned there
today, after police

06:53.179 --> 06:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tear-gassed crowds trying to
storm a crossing
on Sunday.

06:58.218 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street started off with
a rally,
but could not hold on. The Dow
Jones industrial

07:03.023 --> 07:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 20 points to close
at 17556.
The Nasdaq fell 17 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

07:11.598 --> 07:13.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
slipped five.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a closer
look at the candidates' scramble
for votes

07:17.504 --> 07:25.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New York; how corruption
hurts a country's
citizen -- we go inside Kenya;
the paper trail

07:25.145 --> 07:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that connects Syria's president
to torture;
and much more.

07:42.128 --> 07:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With eight days to go until
vote-rich New
York weighs in on the
high-stakes contests

07:47.467 --> 07:52.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the Republican and
Democratic nominations
for president, candidates
stepped up their

07:52.439 --> 07:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticisms of each other and
made their best
cases for more delegates today,
the perfect

07:58.144 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment to turn to Politics
Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR, and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

08:04.884 --> 08:05.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

08:07.587 --> 08:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as we said, no voting this
week, but delegate
selection goes on. And we're
hearing a lot

08:13.226 --> 08:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of complaining, Amy, from Donald
Trump. We
just heard him saying the
process is crooked.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is Ted Cruz doing Donald
Trump isn't?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right.

08:22.902 --> 08:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a process, and it
involves rules,
and Donald Trump seems to have
forgotten that

08:26.706 --> 08:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rules actually have been set a
long time ago.
But here's the two. There are
two ways to

08:29.976 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
win the nomination as a
Republican. You either
come into the convention with
1,237 delegates

08:34.814 --> 08:38.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that is where Trump is ahead
and where
he could -- there is still a
conceivable path

08:39.052 --> 08:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for him to do this by the time
we hit June,
tough, but conceivable.

08:43.823 --> 08:49.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then there is winning the
convention at the
floor, winning by what we're
calling a contested

08:49.696 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention. That's where Ted
Cruz is doing
better. What Ted Cruz is doing
is, he understands

08:54.267 --> 08:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rules and the nuances of how
the game
is played. And that is, when you
win a state,

08:59.472 --> 09:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you win more than just the
votes, you win
actual human beings, delegates
that go and

09:05.111 --> 09:06.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vote on the floor.

09:06.913 --> 09:11.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are bound to voting for who
won that
state on the first round. But
once you get

09:11.184 --> 09:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the second and third rounds
of voting,
most of them are free agents.
Ted Cruz is

09:15.855 --> 09:21.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making sure as many of his
supporters are
getting picked at these places
like Colorado

09:21.461 --> 09:25.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in some other states, North
Dakota, et
cetera, to make sure, even in
South Carolina,

09:25.665 --> 09:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he mentioned, that when we
get to that
second and third ballot, they're
going to

09:29.135 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote for Ted Cruz and not Donald
Trump.

09:31.104 --> 09:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Tamara, if
it's a process
that's been written about, it's
been in the

09:35.875 --> 09:40.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
books for some time, why has it
taken so long
for Donald Trump to focus on it?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Because
he was focused on winning.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:43.817 --> 09:45.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is all
about winning.

09:45.919 --> 09:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, yes, this is
a different
kind of winning and this is sort
of the more

09:51.324 --> 09:54.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
complicated, procedural,
rule-type winning.

09:54.194 --> 09:59.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, at this
convention in Colorado,
Donald Trump showed up with a
gloss glossy

09:59.799 --> 10:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flyer that said here's my slate
of delegates,
vote for them. It included a
number of people

10:06.272 --> 10:10.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that were not on the ballot for
people to
vote.

10:10.477 --> 10:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- my colleagues showed
me a copy of
his slate that he had taken
notes on, and

10:17.917 --> 10:21.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three-quarters of the people on
there, you
couldn't vote for them in the
way that Trump's

10:21.754 --> 10:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people said to vote for them.

10:23.923 --> 10:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, is it too
late for Trump
to catch up? He has hired this
veteran political

10:30.196 --> 10:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operative, Paul Manafort. He's
done some interviews.
We have seen him out over the
weekend. He

10:34.801 --> 10:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is saying, oh, yes, we are going
to catch
up. Is it -- can they catch up?

10:38.605 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: They may be able to,
but it's
really a question about, you
know, they have

10:42.509 --> 10:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already lost in so many of these
places and
it's hard to catch up.

10:46.346 --> 10:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're hearing in state
after state is
that the Cruz campaign has been
there for

10:50.517 --> 10:56.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, they have been doing the
groundwork,
and they have the people there
who are able

10:56.756 --> 10:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go and get on these ballots
or make sure
that they pick the right people
to get on

10:59.993 --> 11:05.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these ballots.
The one thing I want to mention
is, here's
the difficult part about all
this as we're

11:05.532 --> 11:10.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predicting and projecting what's
going to
happen; 2,500 people or so are
delegates.

11:10.470 --> 11:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're all individual human
beings that all
are going to feel incredible
pressure. There

11:15.742 --> 11:19.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are rules that they have to
follow, but once
the ballot opens, once the
voting opens and

11:19.712 --> 11:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're no longer bound by the
rules, they're
going to get pressures from the
candidates.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to get pressures
from their
families, from their colleagues,
and these

11:26.586 --> 11:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people have to go home after
this convention
and go explain their vote to
their friends

11:32.725 --> 11:35.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and family, and that is going to
be something
none of us can predict.

11:35.528 --> 11:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, clearly,
Tamara, it sounds
like Donald Trump's best hope is
to get to

11:40.233 --> 11:42.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
1,237 before they go to
Cleveland.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

11:44.270 --> 11:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is -- by far, if he can
have this done
in one ballot, that is a much
better solution.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
mathematically possible.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: It is
mathematically possible.
By our calculation at this
point, he would

11:54.914 --> 12:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to get about 58 percent of
the remaining
unbound delegates. There are
bound delegates

12:01.854 --> 12:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there are unbound delegates,
and so it's
somewhere between 58 percent and
70 percent

12:07.360 --> 12:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the remaining delegates that
he needs to
get.

12:09.362 --> 12:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's possible. There are a bunch
of winner-take-all
contests. But here's an
indication of the

12:14.734 --> 12:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenge that he faces. In New
York, his
children cannot vote for him
because they

12:20.306 --> 12:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missed the deadline to register
as Republicans
to vote.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which was last
fall, or was
it more recently?

12:25.712 --> 12:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: No, it like three
weeks ago,
I think.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, OK.

12:29.983 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: So there are all
kinds of small
details, and Trump has been
working on the

12:35.989 --> 12:42.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bigger stuff, on the big
message, on getting
this tidal wave of support.

12:42.295 --> 12:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is different from what
happens at
a convention, which is why
Donald Trump really

12:47.567 --> 12:49.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wants to win before a
convention.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, just
quickly on this,
when he says it's crooked and
his delegate

12:53.506 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hunter says they're using
gestapo-like tactics,
is there anything...

12:58.044 --> 12:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: There's one thing
that we have
seen about this.

12:59.879 --> 13:03.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, this is still is something
of a Wild
West. There are not really any
rules about

13:03.516 --> 13:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you can and can't do to woo
a delegate.
Theoretically, you can't give
them actual

13:09.989 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cash, right? There are bribery
statutes. But
some people are arguing, Well,
as long as

13:15.261 --> 13:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not an elected official,
I don't know
if it's considered a bribe to
give them, I

13:19.699 --> 13:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know, maybe a trip on a
nice airplane
with the name Trump on the side
of it.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Gold-plated seat
belts on that
plane?

13:26.973 --> 13:28.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Maybe.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's
quickly move over
to the Democrats,, because,
Tamara, yes, does

13:32.211 --> 13:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the words of war between
Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders does seem to
have cooled

13:35.581 --> 13:38.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down a little bit. But, as we
heard, they're
still taking shots at...

13:38.518 --> 13:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I don't know if it
really cooled
down or not.

13:40.453 --> 13:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maybe it hasn't.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

13:42.855 --> 13:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But where does it
stand? She's
ahead in the polls in New York,
but he is

13:46.259 --> 13:49.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, I have won the last
umpteen contests
here.

13:49.262 --> 13:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Right. And he has
won the last
umpteen contests, and he has
momentum.

13:55.802 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One interesting thing, though,
about that
momentum is, in Wyoming, which
held its caucuses

14:00.540 --> 14:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the weekend, he won, and he
won fairly
significantly, but, in the end,
the delegates

14:06.646 --> 14:12.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were a tie. They both got seven
delegates,
seven pledged delegates, which
means that

14:12.218 --> 14:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he didn't eat into her delegate
lead any at
all.

14:17.423 --> 14:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he still needs to win about
57.5 percent
of the remaining delegates.
Totally possible.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Not easy.

14:25.765 --> 14:30.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And here,
quickly, Amy, delegates'
numbers, very different from the
Republicans,

14:30.770 --> 14:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you have got the so-called
superdelegates,
and she, Hillary Clinton, way
ahead...

14:34.974 --> 14:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, way ahead with
the superdelegates,
but also she is significantly
ahead with delegates,

14:40.546 --> 14:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even further ahead today than
Barack Obama
was ahead of her at this point
in 2008.

14:46.119 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, her argument is, what she
would like to
see is, I want to switch now,
this race is

14:50.623 --> 14:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically mathematically over, I
want to get
to the general election. But you
know what?

14:53.826 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Primary voters aren't there yet.
They want
to see this contest continue.
And she has

14:57.497 --> 15:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got to be able to do. She has
got to be able
to show graciousness as the
front-runner and

15:01.667 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the likely nominee, while also
being able
to be a general election
candidate.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And pivot to
Donald Trump,
which she's started to do. She
is running

15:08.908 --> 15:10.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ads on him.

15:10.476 --> 15:14.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, she's having
to beat off
the criticisms from Sanders.

15:14.180 --> 15:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, and what she
said today
is that she can walk and chew
gum at the same

15:18.551 --> 15:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time. She can fight Bernie
Sanders and Donald
Trump at the same time.

15:22.488 --> 15:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders is out with an ad about
fracking,
which is an issue that is going
to be more

15:27.693 --> 15:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an issue in Pennsylvania. And
he's getting
that out there, I think, in
hopes of it coming

15:32.331 --> 15:33.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up at the debate.

15:33.833 --> 15:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there is so
much. And
we love having both of you.

15:37.203 --> 15:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tamara Keith, Amy Walter, thank
you both.

15:37.970 --> 15:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

15:38.704 --> 15:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Thank you, Judy.

15:46.245 --> 15:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we continue
our series
Inside Kenya.

15:59.959 --> 16:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The World Bank says Kenya is
growing faster
than any other sub-Saharan
African country.

16:05.531 --> 16:09.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But there is one major
impediment to the country's
continued growth.

16:09.202 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, in partnership with the
Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent

16:13.873 --> 16:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nick Schifrin and producer Zach
Fannin examine
the reality of Kenyan
corruption.

16:19.011 --> 16:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Kenya, even
the world's
fastest men can't outrun
corruption.

16:27.887 --> 16:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Rift Valley is known as the
Valley of
Champions. The best marathon
runners are born

16:32.158 --> 16:37.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here and train here.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mind if I join you?

16:39.298 --> 16:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Kiplimo runs three times
a day. He
is tireless and fast. He
averages about 4.5

16:44.804 --> 16:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
minutes a mile. It's tough to
keep up.

16:47.273 --> 16:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Whoa. He's good. And that's slow
for him.

16:52.044 --> 16:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After years of training, he
finally broke
through. He finished third in
last year's

16:57.016 --> 16:58.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nairobi Marathon.

16:58.317 --> 17:01.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HILLARY KIPLIMO, Marathon
Runner: This is
for position.

17:01.420 --> 17:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So, it says
number three, because
you came in third.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY KIPLIMO: Yes.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He and his wife
thought he'd
finally fulfilled his dream of
running his

17:10.863 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way out of poverty. But his
dream's been denied.

17:13.933 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you got your medal, you got
this number
three, you got the jersey and
you got this,

17:19.238 --> 17:21.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but you never got a cent.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY KIPLIMO: I never got a
cent.

17:23.242 --> 17:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On the results
Web site, his
name was replaced. And his
$3,500 winnings

17:28.614 --> 17:29.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vanished.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, where's the money going?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY KIPLIMO: I think those
people, they
kept the money.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Athletics Kenya,
the race organizers.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY KIPLIMO: Yes.

17:37.790 --> 17:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Last November,
dozens of runners
protested at Athletics Kenya.
The group has

17:42.128 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exclusive oversight of all
Kenyan athletes.

17:47.333 --> 17:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kenyans hold records in nearly
every distance.
They say, as they run faster,
Athletics Kenya

17:52.171 --> 17:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steals more. Athletics Kenya
didn't respond
to a half-dozen e-mails from
"PBS NewsHour."

17:58.678 --> 18:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary suspects there's only
way to get their
attention.

18:01.714 --> 18:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY KIPLIMO: When you go to
explain, they
ask you for something.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: They're asking
you to give
them some money?

18:09.889 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY KIPLIMO: Yes.

18:12.124 --> 18:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The problem
extends far beyond
athletics. There's a saying
here: Kenya is

18:17.797 --> 18:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the homeland of the bribe. And
in the mostly
Muslim neighborhood of
Eastleigh, Nairobi,

18:22.668 --> 18:25.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the victims of those bribes
point their finger
at one perpetrator.

18:25.938 --> 18:30.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAHI MOHAMED, Kenya: If you
look at the
police who are meant to protect
them, they

18:30.509 --> 18:32.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just arrest them to extort cash.

18:32.578 --> 18:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Abdullahi Mohamed
and most
of this community are Ethnic
Somali. He says

18:37.183 --> 18:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police come here not to patrol,
but to get
rich.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAHI MOHAMED: You see cars
from all police
stations in Nairobi converging
here.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: They refer to
this neighborhood
as what?

18:46.192 --> 18:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABDULLAHI MOHAMED: ATM machine.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: An ATM machine,
because they
take so much money.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABDULLAHI MOHAMED: They take so
much money.

18:51.831 --> 18:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Police officers,
when promised
anonymity, admit they're more
focused on keeping

18:56.669 --> 18:59.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the cash than keeping the peace.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How were police officers
extorting people
in Eastleigh?

19:02.341 --> 19:06.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The little amount that you
are paid as
salary cannot get up for you and
your family.

19:06.412 --> 19:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if somebody gives you some
amount somewhere,
you have to take the money and
then you forget

19:10.950 --> 19:12.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about work.

19:12.952 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Is this
corruption being practiced
by so many police officers in so
many different

19:17.990 --> 19:19.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas?

19:19.759 --> 19:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Of course, of course. It's
right from
the junior officer to the
higher-most.

19:22.361 --> 19:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And the problem
is, when the
police are for sale, criminals
buy their freedom.

19:28.300 --> 19:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: A criminal can come, do
anything that
they want, they go free. You
will pay and

19:38.010 --> 19:44.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you go free.
NICK SCHIFRIN: And while police
let criminals
free, they arrest
anti-corruption campaigners

19:44.483 --> 19:53.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like 32-year-old Boniface
Mwangi. In a country
where activist is a dirty word,
Mwangi is

19:54.060 --> 19:55.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a fearless, relentless
firebrand.

19:55.928 --> 20:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONIFACE MWANGI, Activist: The
corruption
in this country starts from the
presidency

20:00.399 --> 20:05.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the judiciary to the
legislature. So, all
arms of the government are
rotten.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are here today because the
people we elected
are thieves.

20:08.941 --> 20:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He is a former
journalist whose
political activism is often a
performance.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He covered pigs with fake blood
outside Parliament.

20:20.119 --> 20:26.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BONIFACE MWANGI: Pigs are
selfish. And our
members of Parliament are like
pigs. If you

20:26.325 --> 20:30.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steal a lot of money, you go
into politics
and you buy yourself immunity.
You can get

20:31.063 --> 20:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away with anything in this
country, provided
you have the money to buy your
way off.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every sector in this section is
affected by
corruption.

20:38.204 --> 20:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He might be
considered over
the top, except what he's
fighting is so outrageous.

20:45.010 --> 20:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, schoolkids protested
when a landowner
confiscated their playground to
build a parking

20:49.849 --> 20:51.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lot.

20:51.784 --> 20:58.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BONIFACE MWANGI: They
tear-gassed innocent
kids who only wanted to access
their playground.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other countries have mafia. In
Kenya, the
mafia have a country.

21:01.527 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The wealth gap
here makes the
corruption more egregious.
According to one

21:05.931 --> 21:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
study, Kenyans pay on average 16
bribes every
month. And in a city where the
bus fare is

21:11.637 --> 21:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less than a dollar a ride,
members of Parliament
here makes 188 times the average
salary, which

21:17.977 --> 21:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the equivalent of a member of
the U.S.
Congress making $8.5 million
every year.

21:22.882 --> 21:26.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GITHONGO, Activist: The
moral authority
of this regime to do anything
about corruption

21:27.086 --> 21:30.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is zero. We have never had that
before.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What do people
know you as?

21:32.224 --> 21:33.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN GITHONGO: The
anti-corruption guy.

21:34.059 --> 21:37.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: John Githongo
knows better
than anyone how a government
becomes corrupt.

21:37.496 --> 21:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the former government's
anti-corruption
czar who became a
whistle-blower. He says

21:41.800 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today's corruption is getting
worse.

21:43.869 --> 21:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GITHONGO: The corruption we
have now
poses an existential risk to
Kenya. Before,

21:50.709 --> 21:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we stole from ourselves. Now,
with the Eurobond,
we are mortgaging the futures of
our children.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: The alleged missing
Eurobond funds.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The Eurobond money had been
misused.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We are in the middle of a
great con game.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What's missing?

22:08.093 --> 22:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX OWINO, Whistle-Blower: Nine
hundred and
ninety-nine U.S. dollars.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: So, $999 million
are missing?

22:13.032 --> 22:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX OWINO: I would prefer the
word unaccounted
for.

22:16.535 --> 22:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Alex Owino used
to work at
the national treasury. Last
year, he blew

22:20.472 --> 22:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the whistle on Eurobond. He
calls it a scheme
to steal a billion dollars.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A billion dollars goes missing.
I mean, how
is that even possible?

22:28.380 --> 22:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX OWINO: It's almost brazen.
If you look
at it, it's almost like a
smash-and-grab heist.

22:33.085 --> 22:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In 2014, the
Kenyan government
issued a bond on the Irish Stock
Exchange

22:38.023 --> 22:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known as a Eurobond, $2.85
billion invested
by J.P. Morgan Chase and
Citibank.

22:44.196 --> 22:49.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UHURU KENYATTA, Kenyan
President: By accessing
these external funds, we will
spur economic

22:49.335 --> 22:54.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
growth, and provide more
employment opportunities
to our people.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Was the pitch a
lie?

22:56.275 --> 23:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX OWINO: As it turned out
now, the pitch
and what exactly transpired are
very different.

23:00.646 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What transpired
were violent
protests, because the treasury
was so empty,

23:06.252 --> 23:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the government couldn't issue
student loans
or pay teachers' salaries.

23:09.521 --> 23:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX OWINO: If you just borrowed
$2 billion,
why are we in this problem?

23:14.560 --> 23:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Late last year,
the treasury
released documents it called
proof the money

23:17.963 --> 23:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived in Kenya, according to
Kenya's top
anti-corruption officer, Halakhe
Waqo.

23:22.001 --> 23:27.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HALAKHE WAQO, Kenyan
Anti-Corruption Official:
All the money that was intended
to be brought

23:27.339 --> 23:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Kenya has been brought back
to Kenya.

23:29.408 --> 23:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But Owino says
those documents
are fake. The invoice numbers
seem falsified.

23:34.280 --> 23:39.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX OWINO: For instance, start
at number
25. The second one is going the
wrong way

23:39.451 --> 23:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the third one is number 25,
which is the
same as the first one.

23:43.956 --> 23:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And another
document is redacted,
hiding the recipient of the
money.

23:47.860 --> 23:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX OWINO: It definitely casts
doubt immediately
on whether they're authentic or
not.

23:52.798 --> 23:57.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: How do you
investigate the
government when it is the
government that

23:57.469 --> 24:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is allowing you to keep your job
and that
is funding this organization?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HALAKHE WAQO: Thank you very
much.

24:02.508 --> 24:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are investigating government
projects on
a daily basis. It is our
responsibility to

24:07.446 --> 24:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigate the government.

24:09.248 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: President Uhuru
Kenyatta has
denied wrongdoing. And he
threatens anyone

24:13.452 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who a accuses him of corruption
without proof.

24:15.688 --> 24:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UHURU KENYATTA: If you make
accusations, and
fail to prove them, you too will
also be held

24:21.927 --> 24:22.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accountable.

24:22.594 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Thank you very much.

24:24.430 --> 24:29.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The threats are
effective.
When average Kenyans stand up to
corruption,

24:29.234 --> 24:30.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they often lose everything.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What happens to people in Kenya
who try and
fight corruption?

24:33.806 --> 24:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL MWIRIGI, Kenya: You will
be targeted,
and you will be very unfairly
treated.

24:39.345 --> 24:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Fifteen years
ago, Daniel Mwirigi
investigated fraud at a Kenya's
Postbank.

24:44.116 --> 24:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He discovered bank officers were
stealing
Western Union transactions. But
when he reported

24:49.154 --> 24:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crime, he says his bosses
colluded to
frame him with the very crimes
he had exposed.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL MWIRIGI: The fraudsters
were within.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: You found these
fraudulent
transactions?

24:58.997 --> 25:00.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL MWIRIGI: Yes.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And you
investigated them.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL MWIRIGI: I investigated
them.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And, eventually,
they would
charge you.

25:05.471 --> 25:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL MWIRIGI: With the same.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: With the same
exact things.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL MWIRIGI: Yes.

25:09.108 --> 25:12.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It took him
nearly two years
to clear his name. By then, he'd
lost his

25:12.177 --> 25:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job, health, and reputation for
good.

25:15.381 --> 25:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL MWIRIGI: My father was
alive that time.
He has died thinking that I am a
thief. My

25:20.652 --> 25:26.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother was alive. She has died
thinking that
I'm a thief. There's no point of
doing a good

25:26.325 --> 25:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job in this country. The future
generations
are doomed.

25:31.964 --> 25:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kenyans refer to
stealing as
eating. Today, Kenyans say they
watch the

25:38.504 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rich and the powerful get fat,
while the people
starve.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin
in Nairobi, Kenya.

25:48.747 --> 25:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:58.824 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
complex link
between income and life
expectancy; a Ken

26:04.997 --> 26:10.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burns documentary on the legacy
of baseball
hero Jackie Robinson; and a new
drama from

26:11.003 --> 26:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the playwright of "August: Osage
County."

26:13.972 --> 26:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we turn to the
effort to catalog
war crimes in real time during
the ongoing

26:20.212 --> 26:21.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Syrian civil war.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that story.

26:24.082 --> 26:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years of
war have killed
hundreds of thousands of people
in Syria in

26:28.620 --> 26:34.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this many-sided and brutal
conflict. But there's
now a project under way that's
trying to document

26:34.259 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the principal role of the Bashar
al-Assad
regime in the killing and its
systematic campaign

26:40.199 --> 26:42.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of detention, torture and
murder.

26:43.001 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story of this remarkable
forensic effort
and the appalling acts it
catalogs is told

26:48.474 --> 26:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this week's "New Yorker" by
reporter Ben
Taub in his piece called "The
Assad Files."

26:53.679 --> 26:55.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ben Taub joins me now.

26:55.547 --> 26:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what is this organization?
It's not the
United Nations. It's not the
International

26:59.618 --> 27:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Criminal Court. But it seems
almost more effective
in the amount of evidence that
it's gathered

27:04.156 --> 27:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on what's happening in Syria.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN TAUB, "The New Yorker":
Right.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's an independent agency
called the
Commission for International
Justice and Accountability.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because they're independent,
they don't
-- they have a -- they can
operate with a

27:14.766 --> 27:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very high risk tolerance and
outside of the
geopolitics that usually govern
permissions

27:19.972 --> 27:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for such AN investigation.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what's the
type of evidence
that they have now and how do we
know that

27:26.078 --> 27:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Assad is responsible for some of
these acts?

27:28.413 --> 27:32.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEN TAUB: So, they have
collected documentation
evidence from all over the
country. They have

27:32.417 --> 27:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smuggled about 600,000 pages out
of Syria
at very high risk. They have had
-- one courier

27:38.323 --> 27:44.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was killed, two have been
wounded, and -- but
in recent years, they have
gotten much better

27:44.129 --> 27:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with operational security.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have also...

27:48.200 --> 27:49.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: These are
basically people
who are deciding to leak
documents and somehow

27:49.868 --> 27:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get it in the hands of the CIJA.

27:51.770 --> 27:56.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN TAUB: So there is a leaker
from Damascus.
He was -- he worked within
Assad's innermost

27:56.375 --> 28:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security committee as a -- as a
mole essentially.
He was hired basically to
process all of the

28:01.179 --> 28:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paperwork for Assad's innermost
security committee.

28:05.217 --> 28:10.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was a member of the
opposition from
the beginning. And so it's from
his testimony

28:10.455 --> 28:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we know a lot of how that
committee worked.
And he basically saw that, every
single night,

28:17.129 --> 28:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assad's crisis cell which he
formed in response
to the Syrian crisis in 2011,
and they would

28:23.902 --> 28:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
demand security reports from all
over the
country.

28:25.904 --> 28:30.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this young man named
Abdelmajid Barakat
would collect all of the
reports, read them

28:30.475 --> 28:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and draft a summary for them to
look at as
they had the meeting. Now, after
their meetings,

28:34.980 --> 28:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they have decided how to
handle each
security issue, they would send
a list of

28:39.184 --> 28:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recommendations to Assad through
a courier,
and he would then review them,
sometimes cross

28:43.889 --> 28:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things out, sometimes add...

28:45.924 --> 28:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Assad would actually
read these reports?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN TAUB: Absolutely.

28:49.127 --> 28:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Edit them,
sign them?

28:50.362 --> 28:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN TAUB: And then return them
to the crisis
cell.

28:52.331 --> 28:56.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And once they had clear
instructions, they
would then send them through
their individual

28:56.168 --> 29:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chains of command to the distant
provinces,
where the security agents on the
ground were

29:02.874 --> 29:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually implementing them to
put down the
revolution.

29:06.311 --> 29:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In practice, the policy itself,
while repressive,
is not inherently criminal,
necessarily. But

29:13.452 --> 29:19.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the course of its
implantation, tens of
thousands of Syrians were
detained for months

29:19.424 --> 29:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or even years, tortured into
false confessions.

29:22.060 --> 29:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So tell me the
story of
Mazen al-Hamada, a character
that you use

29:26.365 --> 29:29.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to do detail some of the
atrocities that are
happening in Syria.

29:29.968 --> 29:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN TAUB: Yes, so Hamada, he was
an activist
in Deir el-Zour, came from a
middle-class

29:34.973 --> 29:41.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
family, worked for an oil
company. So when
he was arrested in early 2012,
he was dragged

29:41.213 --> 29:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the air force intelligence
branch in
al-Mezzeh Military Airport.

29:45.117 --> 29:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was after a couple of
months in detention,
with no idea where he was at
this point, he

29:50.756 --> 29:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was taken into an interrogation
room and he
was first tortured by -- they
burned out cigarettes

29:56.495 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his body. They beat him. They
strung him
up by his wrists, so that his
feet were off

30:02.000 --> 30:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ground, and he felt his
wrists were going
to get cut off.

30:05.237 --> 30:10.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All the while, they were
interrogating him
over the same questions that the
crisis cell

30:10.509 --> 30:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had devised in its plan to put
down the revolution.

30:13.178 --> 30:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At one point,
he's so injured
from this process that they move
him to what

30:18.150 --> 30:20.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they call a hospital.

30:20.352 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN TAUB: So, Mazen was sent to
Hospital 601,
which is a military hospital.
And this turned

30:25.223 --> 30:29.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to be the place where they
would process
the bodies of detainees who had
been killed

30:29.361 --> 30:31.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in security branches.

30:31.229 --> 30:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was brought there. And on his
first night,
he had to go to the bathroom.
And a guard

30:35.434 --> 30:39.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dragged him to the bathroom door
and let him
in. And when he opened the first
bathroom

30:39.304 --> 30:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stall, he saw a pile of bodies.
And he started
to feel like this was -- he was
in a nightmare.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he went to the second stall
and opened
that, and there were two more
bodies with

30:48.880 --> 30:53.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their eyes gouged out. And there
was another
body by the sink. And he felt
like he was

30:53.985 --> 30:58.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
losing his grip on reality. He
walked out
to the guard and said, you know,
where am

30:58.890 --> 31:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I supposed to pee? And the guard
told him
to pee on top of the bodies.

31:02.427 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How do we
verify his version
of events is true?

31:08.500 --> 31:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN TAUB: So, after he was
released, he spoke
to a group of activists and gave
his full

31:15.741 --> 31:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
testimony in detail with a
published dateline
back in October 2013 in Arabic.

31:21.279 --> 31:28.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few months after that, a
military police
photographer who had defected,
he spoke to

31:28.120 --> 31:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigators and forensic
analysts, and a
report was leaked. And he had
this collection

31:33.725 --> 31:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 55,000 pictures with 11,000
bodies in it.
And he was photographing them at
the hospital

31:38.764 --> 31:42.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where Mazen was staying, and
Mazen's testimony
came out first.

31:42.701 --> 31:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so his account lines up with
-- it was
later corroborated by a huge
quantity of material.

31:47.672 --> 31:52.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It seems like
they have
all the necessary ammunition to
prosecute

31:52.711 --> 31:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Assad if he ever gets into a
court.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN TAUB: Exactly.

31:57.549 --> 32:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they have the chain of
command. And their
thought is that, eventually,
when the international

32:03.321 --> 32:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community catches up and there
is a resolution
to the crisis in Syria, that,
some way or

32:08.560 --> 32:11.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another, they will be able to
hand over their
evidence to a court that can
prosecute it.

32:12.097 --> 32:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The report is
called "The
Assad Files" by Ben Taub in this
week's "New

32:15.901 --> 32:16.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yorker."

32:16.668 --> 32:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks so much for joining us.

32:21.506 --> 32:25.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEN TAUB: Thank you.

32:25.644 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the
connections between
income, geography, and life
expectancy.

32:33.251 --> 32:38.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a sobering fact that the
poorest citizens
have shorter life spans than
wealthier Americans.

32:38.957 --> 32:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But new research published finds
that the
gap in life expectancy is
growing. Since 2000,

32:44.963 --> 32:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the wealthiest 5 percent of
Americans can
now expect to live an additional
three years.

32:50.569 --> 32:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the very poorest, there's
been almost
no change.

32:54.206 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet research also found that
the poorest
who live in affluent and highly
educated cities

33:00.212 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live longer than other poor
Americans.

33:03.281 --> 33:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Raj Chetty is the co-author, and
he's an economist
at Stanford University.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Raj Chetty, welcome to the
program.

33:10.755 --> 33:14.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why is this gap in life spans
getting longer
for so many people?

33:14.960 --> 33:17.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAJ CHETTY, Professor of
Economics, Stanford
University: Well, Judy, what
we're seeing

33:17.128 --> 33:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is that there is a really
dramatic increase
in life spans for the very
highest-income

33:21.666 --> 33:24.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Americans throughout the
country.

33:24.636 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's interesting is that, for
the low-income
Americans, say in the bottom 20
percent, we

33:29.875 --> 33:34.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find that the story is very
heterogeneous
across places. There are some
places like

33:34.512 --> 33:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Birmingham, Alabama, where the
poor are gaining
just as much in life expectancy
as the rich,

33:40.752 --> 33:45.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there are other places like
Tampa, Florida,
where the poor actually losing
in terms of

33:45.624 --> 33:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life expectancy, where they live
shorter lives
today than they did in 2000, at
the beginning

33:51.263 --> 33:53.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this millennium.

33:53.131 --> 33:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so in terms of understanding
why we're
seeing this increasing gap, I
think the story

33:57.569 --> 34:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not just one at the national
level. It's
one that is going to force us to
look at the

34:01.873 --> 34:08.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local level to understand why
the trend looks
so positive in Birmingham, yet
so negative

34:08.146 --> 34:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in other places like Tampa.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And are there
clues now as
to why that is?

34:12.217 --> 34:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAJ CHETTY: The places with the
highest levels
of life expectancy for the poor
tend to have

34:17.822 --> 34:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better health behaviors, perhaps
not surprisingly.
These are places with lower
levels of obesity,

34:23.128 --> 34:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher rates of exercise, lower
levels of
smoking.

34:25.630 --> 34:32.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also tend to be cities like
New York
and San Francisco, more
affluent, highly educated,

34:32.404 --> 34:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high-cost-of-living cities,
where the poor
seem to be doing better. Now, we
don't know

34:36.875 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly why. One potential
hypothesis is that
these types of cities invest a
lot in public

34:44.049 --> 34:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health. They're often the first
cities to
enact things like smoking bans
or bans on

34:48.286 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trans fats, which could end up
improving the
health of not just the rich, but
also the

34:54.025 --> 34:54.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poor.

34:54.993 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that remains to be explored
further.

34:56.861 --> 34:59.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's not --
and it's not
just the big cities, the New
Yorks and the

34:59.898 --> 35:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
San Franciscos. You said it's a
Birmingham.
It's the medium-sized cities as
well.

35:04.402 --> 35:06.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAJ CHETTY: That's right.

35:06.371 --> 35:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really remarkable how
diverse the patterns
are around the country. There is
no systematic

35:11.209 --> 35:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bloc of cities where you find
clear gains.
The general patterns are
affluent, educated

35:17.882 --> 35:23.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities, but it includes places
like Cincinnati,
Ohio, where we're seeing very
positive trends,

35:23.922 --> 35:26.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Birmingham, Alabama.

35:26.124 --> 35:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In general, levels of life
expectancy are
highest on the coasts for
low-income people,

35:31.730 --> 35:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California and the Northeast,
and they tend
to be the lowest in Nevada and
then the geographic

35:36.501 --> 35:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belt running through the middle
of the country,
including states like Oklahoma
and Detroit,

35:42.073 --> 35:43.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Michigan, and so forth.

35:43.942 --> 35:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what did you
find with
regard to gender, in terms of
women at both

35:49.381 --> 35:52.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ends of the income scale, and
men?

35:52.817 --> 35:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAJ CHETTY: We find large gaps
in life expectancy
in the U.S. as a whole between
the highest-

35:58.356 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and lowest-income Americans for
both men and
women.

36:02.160 --> 36:07.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For men, being in the top 1
percent of the
income distribution gives you a
life that's

36:07.599 --> 36:12.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about 15 years longer, on
average, than men
in the bottom 1 percent of the
income distribution.

36:12.871 --> 36:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For women, the gap is 10 years,
still large
but not quite as large.

36:17.142 --> 36:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's interesting, Judy,
about the gender
difference is that it's well
known that women

36:22.113 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tend to live longer than men on
average, but
we find that that's much more
true at low-income

36:27.118 --> 36:33.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
levels. Among low-income
families, women live
about six or seven years longer
than men.

36:33.691 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the highest income levels,
women live only
about one year longer than men.

36:37.328 --> 36:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
what questions
does this lead you to? What do
you want to

36:42.667 --> 36:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know next in order to understand
this better?

36:44.836 --> 36:50.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAJ CHETTY: Well, what this
research shows
us is that there is a great deal
of inequality

36:50.241 --> 36:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in life expectancy in America,
but it's not
inevitable.

36:54.012 --> 36:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some places in America
where gaps
in health outcomes and life
expectancy are

36:58.817 --> 37:03.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much smaller, and what I think
that shows
us is that we can learn from
those places,

37:03.488 --> 37:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places like New York and San
Francisco, and
places like on a positive
trajectory like

37:07.559 --> 37:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Birmingham and Cincinnati, learn
what those
places are doing right, and
hopefully translate

37:12.664 --> 37:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those lessons to other areas to
reduce inequality
and help outcomes more broadly.

37:18.203 --> 37:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question going forward is,
what exactly
is the recipe to do that? And
our hope is

37:22.607 --> 37:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these data that we have put
out in this
study will be useful in helping
researchers

37:27.679 --> 37:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and policy-makers figure that
out.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Raj Chetty,
economics professor
at Stanford University, thank
you.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAJ CHETTY: Thank you.

37:35.120 --> 37:39.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can hear
more from
Raj Chetty about the long-term
implications

37:39.791 --> 37:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of disparities, both racial and
economic,
by watching a recent interview
he did on our

37:44.762 --> 37:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Web site. It's part of our
ongoing series
Race Matters. That's at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

37:57.942 --> 38:08.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now: the legacy of one of
baseball's greatest,
Jackie Robinson, on and off the
field.

38:08.820 --> 38:13.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's the focus of a new
documentary that begins
on PBS tonight.

38:13.191 --> 38:15.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our look.

38:15.193 --> 38:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The four-hour program
was produced
by Ken Burns and airs over two
nights, interesting

38:20.365 --> 38:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow night. It's narrated by
Keith David,
with Jamie Foxx reading Jackie
Robinson's

38:26.037 --> 38:27.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
words.

38:27.906 --> 38:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seeks to show a deeper and
fuller view
of Robinson's achievements and
challenges.

38:32.410 --> 38:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a short excerpt about how
Jackie was
treated after Brooklyn Dodgers
president Branch

38:36.681 --> 38:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rickey selected him to break the
color barrier.

38:39.584 --> 38:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should warn you, though, that
the documentary
is explicit about the epithets
and racist

38:44.322 --> 38:48.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language that Robinson endured,
and some of
that is in this clip.

38:48.826 --> 38:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH DAVID, Narrator: Robinson
faced everything
Rickey said he would. Pitchers
threw at his

38:56.768 --> 39:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head. More than once, runners
sprinting towards
first base spiked Robinson with
their cleats,

39:03.174 --> 39:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a hard slide by Robinson
wouldn't go unnoticed
by opposing infielders.

39:11.749 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before Brooklyn played Ben
Chapman's Phillies
in Philadelphia, Branch Rickey
received a

39:16.688 --> 39:22.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call from the president of the
team. "Don't
bring the nigger here," he said.
"We're just

39:22.527 --> 39:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not ready for that sort of thing
yet."

39:25.196 --> 39:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And Rickey said, well,
"He's a member
in good standing of the National
League, and

39:30.301 --> 39:33.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you don't want to play us, we
will accept
the forfeit of the game."

39:33.805 --> 39:40.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE FOXX, Actor: "You thought
of Philadelphia
as the city of brotherly love,
but yet when

39:40.111 --> 39:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you went to Philadelphia, you
couldn't stay
in the same hotel. You had to
find your own

39:50.722 --> 39:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accommodations. And then there
was Ben Chapman
and some of the other Phillies,
who were vicious

39:55.026 --> 39:56.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and uncalled for."

39:56.861 --> 40:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH DAVID: During one game,
Cubs shortstop
Len Merullo kicks Jackie as they
untangle

40:03.201 --> 40:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves after a close play at
second. As
the Brooklyn bench should at
Merullo, Jackie

40:10.108 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
angrily picked himself up, but
didn't strike
back.

40:13.544 --> 40:19.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The documentary lays
out what Robinson
went through as a player, as a
leader, and,

40:19.217 --> 40:23.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after his baseball career ended,
as a civil
rights figure.

40:23.288 --> 40:28.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's get some personal
perspective on this
from Dusty Baker. He was a
player for 19 years,

40:28.993 --> 40:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notably with the Atlanta Braves
and Los Angeles
Dodgers. He's been a manager for
two decades

40:33.798 --> 40:39.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and is now manager of the
Washington Nationals.
He joins from his office at Nats
Park.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Baker, thanks for being with
us.

40:41.205 --> 40:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So much of the focus about
Jackie Robinson
is about that one year, the year
he broke

40:46.110 --> 40:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the color barrier, but I don't
think a lot
of people realize the influence
he had on

40:51.416 --> 40:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
players long after his playing
career had
ended. Talk about the direct
link between

40:57.922 --> 41:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jackie Robinson and you through
Hank Aaron.

41:00.892 --> 41:04.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUSTY BAKER, Manager, Washington
Nationals:
Well, actually, it started with
my parents.

41:04.862 --> 41:10.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, most -- at that
time, most
African-American parents, if
they were baseball

41:10.702 --> 41:14.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fans, they were Dodger fans
because of Jackie
Robinson. So, you know, my dad
used to tell

41:14.706 --> 41:19.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me all the time, you know, what
would Jackie
do in that situation if I was
fighting or

41:19.510 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something.

41:21.446 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I was fortunate enough
to have played
with Hank Aaron with the Atlanta
Braves. And

41:24.649 --> 41:28.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hank told me he went to see
Jackie when he
was a youngster and how much
influence he

41:28.986 --> 41:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had on him. And, you know, I was
close to
Hank. I was with Hank, you know,
most days

41:35.259 --> 41:39.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from 19 to 25 years or 24 years
old.

41:39.330 --> 41:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, Hank -- I got to
meet most
of the civic leaders of our time
at that time.

41:45.703 --> 41:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Maynard Jackson,
Andrew Young, Jesse
Jackson, I got to meet all those
through Hank.

41:54.178 --> 42:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jackie Robinson meant a lot
to me because
of my dad and because of, you
know, Hank Aaron.

42:01.018 --> 42:05.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And my mom was an African
studies teacher,
so we knew all about Jackie
Robinson.

42:05.590 --> 42:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you think young
African-American
players today appreciate the
legacy of Jackie

42:10.128 --> 42:12.029 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Robinson?

42:12.130 --> 42:16.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUSTY BAKER: Probably not. I
don't think it's
the African-American players'
fault, necessarily,

42:16.601 --> 42:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of not appreciating Jackie
Robinson. I don't
think we have done a very good
job of, you

42:22.540 --> 42:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, passing along history, not
only of Jackie
Robinson, but the fact of, you
know, in America,

42:28.246 --> 42:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it seems like that's what people
like -- spend
the most -- I mean, the least
amount of time

42:33.251 --> 42:35.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
studying is history.

42:35.153 --> 42:41.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, some of us have
made a conscientious
effort to try to pass along that
history,

42:41.559 --> 42:45.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because if we don't pass along
that history,
you know, it's going to die. I
pass it on

42:45.963 --> 42:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to my son. My son comes in my
office in the
weight room at the house and he
sees, you

42:51.602 --> 42:55.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, different players. He saw
-- he told
me, he said, "Dad, I didn't know
Jackie played

42:55.940 --> 42:58.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ball in Cuba."

42:58.576 --> 43:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I took my family to Cuba a
few years ago,
and so there was a lot that
people don't know

43:04.949 --> 43:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Jackie. They don't know he
went to the
military. You know, there is a
whole bunch

43:08.986 --> 43:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things. But I will tell you,
he was -- and
I asked Jim Gilliam.

43:12.323 --> 43:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first questions I
asked him, I
said, why did he die and how did
he die so

43:17.795 --> 43:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young? And Jim Gilliam told me
at that time
that he thought that Jackie died
of a broken

43:23.801 --> 43:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart. And I really didn't
understand it,
but the longer I live, you know,
the more

43:28.506 --> 43:30.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's understandable.

43:30.508 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you think
that Jackie Robinson
would think of the situation
today? You have

43:34.946 --> 43:39.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got 8 percent of Major League
Baseball players
are African-American. You have a
handful,

43:39.784 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very -- you're one of a very
small number
of African-American managers.

43:43.821 --> 43:49.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're the second winningest
active manager,
but still almost didn't have a
job going into

43:49.193 --> 43:53.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this season. What do you think
of the state
of diversity in baseball today?

43:53.998 --> 43:58.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUSTY BAKER: You know, when I
first came into
the game, I was on the Braves.
We had, I think,

43:58.503 --> 44:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a combination of, I don't know,
eight to 10
African-Americans and Latin
players when I

44:03.908 --> 44:10.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first came into the game. And so
it's definitely
gotten worse. It hasn't gotten
better.

44:11.082 --> 44:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, you know,
we have time
to do something about it. And,
you know, I

44:18.189 --> 44:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have spoken to the commissioner.
You know,
he's very aware of it. You know,
he doesn't

44:22.260 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like it. He told me that he's
glad that I
got a job, because, at the time,
this would

44:29.033 --> 44:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been thee first time in 27
years when
there wasn't an African-American
manager.

44:33.104 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems like, you know, we
have to do
twice as good to accomplish the
same thing.

44:38.175 --> 44:43.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, the scrutiny of
being one of
the few black, African-American
managers,

44:43.614 --> 44:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, is tremendous. And
sometimes you
feel like you're carrying the
weight of, you

44:51.789 --> 44:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, the whole race sometimes,
personally
on this side.

44:55.026 --> 45:01.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, that's
what I feel
that I was chosen, you know, for
God to do,

45:01.399 --> 45:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, you know, here I am in
the nation's
capital, and here I am with this
outstanding

45:07.138 --> 45:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team, best team I have had to
start with.
And I feel that, you know, great
things are

45:11.676 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead for us on the Nationals
and hopefully
us in America.

45:14.912 --> 45:16.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Very good.

45:16.647 --> 45:19.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, Dusty Baker,
congratulations the fast
start. Good luck the rest of the
way, and

45:19.684 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thanks for being with us.

45:21.786 --> 45:30.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUSTY BAKER: All right, you're
welcome.

45:30.561 --> 45:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new play by one
of the nation's
leading playwrights who's known
for his domestic

45:39.170 --> 45:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dramas asks the question, what
makes us us?

45:43.741 --> 45:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown went to Chicago,
where his latest
play opened this weekend to find
out.

45:48.779 --> 45:58.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Eleven scenes
that capture
the life of a woman, from
infancy to age 69,

45:58.689 --> 46:05.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but it's told out of
chronological order.
And she's played by six
different actresses.

46:05.763 --> 46:11.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Mary Page Marlowe," the new
play by Tracy
Letts, is just now opening.

46:11.535 --> 46:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It sounds different every
time you do
it.

46:14.438 --> 46:19.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But when I
visited in early
March, rehearsals had just
begun. And when

46:20.077 --> 46:24.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said it was odd to be there
talking about
a play I hadn't seen, Letts
reminded me of

46:25.082 --> 46:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something rather important if
you happen to
be the playwright.

46:28.252 --> 46:29.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY LETTS, Playwright: I
haven't seen it
either.

46:30.087 --> 46:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You haven't seen
it either.
Do you know what you have at
this point?

46:33.057 --> 46:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: Normally, at this
point, you
have a pretty good sense of what
you have.

46:37.361 --> 46:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But "Mary Page Marlowe" is an
unusual piece,
the nonlinear narrative, the
different women

46:43.134 --> 46:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playing the character. I think I
know what
we have got, but until there's
an audience

46:47.538 --> 46:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the room, I won't really
know.

46:49.440 --> 46:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Letts, now 50, is
best known
for the Tony- and Pulitzer
Prize-winning play

46:55.646 --> 47:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"August: Osage County," later
made into a
film. It tells of an Oklahoma
family in, as

47:05.256 --> 47:15.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a "New York Times" review put
it, in near
apocalyptic meltdown of
dysfunctional behavior.

47:15.332 --> 47:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Letts is also an acclaimed
actor. He won a
Tony Award in 2013 for his role
in another

47:21.238 --> 47:28.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
famous dysfunctional
relationship drama, Edward
Albee's "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?"

47:28.345 --> 47:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More recently, he's starred in
the TV drama
"Homeland" and the film "The Big
Short."

47:34.552 --> 47:37.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: The housing market
is rock-solid.

47:38.089 --> 47:47.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new play has
its own share
of unruly behavior, but its
focus is the deep

47:47.598 --> 47:50.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
subject of identity.

47:50.735 --> 47:58.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: If you sit at all
in the question
of what makes you you, and you
start to ask

47:58.776 --> 48:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yourself, is it my parents, my
background,
my geographical background, my
age, my gender,

48:07.384 --> 48:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what are the things that make
you you?

48:09.120 --> 48:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: We pretend I'm making
decisions about
my life. I am not. I haven't.

48:15.793 --> 48:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Letts says he was
inspired
to write the play after the
death of his mother

48:19.797 --> 48:21.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
18 months ago.

48:21.899 --> 48:27.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: You spend a lot of
time and reflection
about your parents' life, their
journey. "Mary

48:27.638 --> 48:34.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Page Marlowe" is not my mother,
though she's
inspired by my mother, and she's
inspired

48:34.311 --> 48:41.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by the idea that we are
different people at
different points in our life.

48:41.318 --> 48:48.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, my 17-year-old self
wouldn't recognize
the man I am now. And I don't
recognize him

48:48.292 --> 48:49.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much either.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So that makes
life a constant
surprise, right?

48:51.829 --> 48:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: Maybe it speaks to
some -- to
something in me I have -- some
searching in

48:58.202 --> 49:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. I don't know. I know that
I'm a hell of
a lot more comfortable at 50,
comfortable

49:05.876 --> 49:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with who I am than I was with
myself at 30
or at 17.

49:10.648 --> 49:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The monologue, I'm still working
on it.

49:12.850 --> 49:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some of the
comfort clearly
comes from his long association
with Chicago's

49:16.654 --> 49:22.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steppenwolf Theatre Company, a
renowned incubator,
with an ensemble of writers and
actors who've

49:22.860 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had a major influence on the
world of American
theater and beyond.

49:26.430 --> 49:30.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: I can afford to
take chances.
I can afford to make a fool of
myself.

49:30.534 --> 49:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because they will
keep you
around anyway.

49:32.403 --> 49:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: They will keep me
around anyway,
and they will tell me, they will
tell me to

49:36.607 --> 49:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my face, you didn't get this
right.

49:38.242 --> 49:40.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA SHAPIRO, Director: Here are
a couple
of things that I think might
help.

49:40.211 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of those
truth-tellers
is longtime friend and
collaborator Anna Shapiro,

49:45.182 --> 49:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's directed numerous plays at
Steppenwolf
and on Broadway, and was
recently named the

49:49.954 --> 49:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
company's artistic director.
She's now taken
on "Mary Page Marlowe."

49:54.625 --> 49:56.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA SHAPIRO: Have a really
inappropriate
response.

49:56.594 --> 50:00.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first big
challenge of
this play, Shapiro said, was to
make sure

50:00.231 --> 50:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a story that jumps around
chronologically
didn't feel out of order.

50:04.735 --> 50:11.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA SHAPIRO: You just have to
kind of expand
your definition of what is
chronology. I'm

50:12.009 --> 50:14.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not sure life is happening in
order anyway.

50:14.678 --> 50:18.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, the way a
life unfolds
and -- yes.

50:18.282 --> 50:21.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA SHAPIRO: The way life
feels. The way
life feels. I just think when
you get older

50:21.518 --> 50:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I think Tracy and I are
getting a little
bit older -- you do start to
understand the

50:29.994 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of inevitable arbitrariness
of life.
And it feels unrelentingly
arbitrary.

50:38.135 --> 50:41.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARRIE COON, Actress: Really?
You don't know?

50:41.438 --> 50:47.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We watched an
early rehearsal,
in which Mary Page at age 36 is
talking to

50:47.511 --> 50:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her therapist. She's played by
Tracy Letts'
wife, Carrie Coon.

50:51.582 --> 50:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During a key monologue, director
Anna Shapiro
was bothered.

50:55.853 --> 50:58.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA SHAPIRO: My ear is jumping
at "someone
called."

50:58.188 --> 51:01.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: After some
discussion, the
playwright came up with a new
line.

51:01.659 --> 51:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: "I just found out
my college
girlfriend Lorna died from
breast cancer last

51:07.698 --> 51:10.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
month, and I'm sitting here
talking about
compartments."

51:10.901 --> 51:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNA SHAPIRO: That's awesome.

51:12.770 --> 51:16.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The tweaking,
Letts told me
later at his home as he and Coon
made dinner,

51:16.473 --> 51:18.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would continue.

51:18.409 --> 51:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: Every time I write
a new play,
we sit down, we read the thing,
and the fear

51:22.780 --> 51:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that people are going to say,
this is garbage
and they are going to take it
and they're

51:25.816 --> 51:28.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to throw it away and say,
you have done
something just terrible.

51:28.285 --> 51:33.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hope is that they're going
to carry me
out of the theater on their
shoulders, carry

51:33.190 --> 51:37.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me down the street, saying, he's
a genius,
he's a genius. But the reality
is that good,

51:37.494 --> 51:41.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smart people working around me
say, OK, let's
get to work.

51:41.498 --> 51:45.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Letts and Coon
met as actors
in "Who's Afraid Of Virginia
Woolf?"

51:45.602 --> 51:48.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE COON: It's really hard to
find good
roles for women, and my husband
happens to

51:48.973 --> 51:53.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be one of those people who's
actually writing
roles that dignify women,
because he deeply

51:53.277 --> 51:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respects them. And everybody in
his plays,
they're all in there somewhere,
all the people.

51:57.481 --> 52:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I feel like I'm married to a
lot of people.
It's exciting. It's never
boring.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:04.021 --> 52:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A nice domestic
scene, with
a playwright renowned for the
very opposite.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So where does all that
dysfunction come from?

52:10.794 --> 52:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: It's drama. If I
wrote -- if
I just wrote about the healthy
side of myself,

52:16.834 --> 52:18.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it wouldn't be very interesting
or dramatic.

52:19.003 --> 52:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE COON: A married couple
makes aloo gobi
in the kitchen.

52:22.106 --> 52:23.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:23.173 --> 52:24.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRACY LETTS: It doesn't make for
a great scene.

52:25.075 --> 52:29.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE COON: He cuts the
potatoes too small.
She's irritated, but she doesn't
saying anything.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:30.681 --> 52:33.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not great
theater, perhaps,
but a fine dinner.

52:33.384 --> 52:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Chicago, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

52:38.455 --> 52:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, a
