of combing the color
of the wallpaper

00:36.400 --> 00:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was that these were
not honorable people

00:40.633 --> 00:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that protecting
the FBI from them

00:44.200 --> 00:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

faces new revelations

tonight over the
investigation of

01:20.866 --> 01:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alleged collusion
between campaign aides

01:23.666 --> 01:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Russia the New

01:26.133 --> 01:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the president told Russian

01:27.533 --> 01:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diplomats last week
that FBI director

01:30.300 --> 01:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
James Comey was quote
a real nutjob and

01:33.633 --> 01:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that firing him
removed quote great

pressure on the
president over the

01:38.200 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

The Washington

01:40.533 --> 01:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Post is reporting
that a current senior

01:43.333 --> 01:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House adviser
is now a person of

01:46.300 --> 01:48.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interest in the
investigation the

01:48.566 --> 01:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stories broke just
after the president

01:50.733 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the first lady
boarded Air Force One

01:53.133 --> 01:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and took off for
Saudi Arabia it's the

01:55.900 --> 01:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first stop on a
nine-day trip to the

Middle East in
Europe for more we're

02:00.766 --> 02:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to turn first
to mark Mazzetti of

02:02.800 --> 02:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the New York Times
mark thank you for

02:05.433 --> 02:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being here the story
in your newspaper

02:07.566 --> 02:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that broke just a
couple of hours ago is

02:10.100 --> 02:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interesting because
it's what the

02:11.566 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president said in
that meeting he had

02:13.900 --> 02:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Foreign
Minister of Russia and

02:16.300 --> 02:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russian ambassador
to the u.s. yeah

02:19.700 --> 02:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's an extraordinary
moment where you

02:22.800 --> 02:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know this meeting
we already knew

02:24.000 --> 02:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happened the day after
Trump fired James

02:27.466 --> 02:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey as FBI director
and now we know

02:29.400 --> 02:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that and one of the
reasons he fired him

02:31.466 --> 02:33.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he has said is in
part because of this

02:33.266 --> 02:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia probe and then
he's meeting with

02:35.233 --> 02:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian officials and
he tells them that

02:37.200 --> 02:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he got rid of this
quote nut job which

02:40.466 --> 02:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has relieved pressure
from him so it is

02:43.600 --> 02:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sort of amazing to hear that the

02:45.200 --> 02:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president said that
to the Russians in

02:48.300 --> 02:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Oval Office and
the fact that of

02:50.566 --> 02:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
course it's the
Russians that are the

02:52.766 --> 02:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
subject of this the
Trump connection to

02:55.433 --> 02:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Russians is a subject of the

02:56.900 --> 02:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation
that's right and so

02:59.600 --> 03:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's a tremendous
amount of irony

03:01.400 --> 03:02.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here

03:02.633 --> 03:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
maybe intentional
maybe not but the it

03:05.833 --> 03:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also I think most
importantly probably

03:08.466 --> 03:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reinforces the idea
that the Russia

03:12.566 --> 03:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
probe did play a
pretty significant

03:15.466 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
factor in the
president's decision to

03:18.066 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dismiss Comey

03:19.266 --> 03:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as you know over
the last week since

03:21.000 --> 03:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey was fired we've
heard a number of

03:23.066 --> 03:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
justifications for
the firing and the

03:26.866 --> 03:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has said once that
the Russia probe

03:29.733 --> 03:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
played a part but
this is another

03:31.333 --> 03:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
example of the president
saying that the

03:33.733 --> 03:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia FBI investigation
did play a big

03:36.633 --> 03:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
role so I mean this
is what kind of gets

03:38.733 --> 03:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the central question
here of whether

03:40.700 --> 03:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's really something
improper in the

03:42.766 --> 03:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
firing people have
raised the question

03:44.666 --> 03:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of whether it was
obstruction of justice

03:46.200 --> 03:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and him bringing up
to the Russians just

03:48.366 --> 03:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is kind of another
data point here

03:50.133 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exactly and as you
point out there have

03:52.733 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been different
differing explanations

03:54.100 --> 03:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over the course of
the last week or so

03:56.133 --> 03:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at one point of
course the White House

03:57.400 --> 03:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
originally saying
that it had to do with

03:59.566 --> 04:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way Jim Comey
handled the Hillary

04:01.900 --> 04:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clinton email
investigation but then

04:04.333 --> 04:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eventually as you
say the president

04:06.366 --> 04:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
referred to Russia
I also found it

04:08.166 --> 04:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
striking my mark
Mazzetti what the White

04:10.933 --> 04:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House had to say
that they basically

04:12.533 --> 04:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
acknowledged that
the president said

04:15.066 --> 04:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this and that they
said at one point

04:18.566 --> 04:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
once again the real
story is that our

04:21.000 --> 04:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
national security has
been undermined by

04:23.366 --> 04:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the leaking of
private and highly

04:25.266 --> 04:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
classified conversations
so they're not

04:27.033 --> 04:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disputing this was
said no and they're

04:29.966 --> 04:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
characterizing it a little bit

04:31.200 --> 04:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
differently they're
saying what he was

04:32.733 --> 04:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
referring to was that
he had been under

04:35.200 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of pressure by the Russia

04:37.933 --> 04:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation that the Russians

04:39.500 --> 04:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves had put
him under pressure so

04:41.333 --> 04:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he was kind of using
it as a sort of

04:42.666 --> 04:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bargaining chip to
telling these Russian

04:44.633 --> 04:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
visiting officials
you guys put me under

04:46.966 --> 04:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pressure by this
thing and so now let's

04:49.533 --> 04:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meet you know kind
of let's make a deal

04:50.833 --> 04:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
let's let's let's
move on to other

04:52.700 --> 04:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
things so he was
using it as leverage

04:53.966 --> 04:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know whether you
want to accept that

04:56.100 --> 04:58.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
justification or
not that's what the

04:58.100 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House is saying
although as you

04:59.633 --> 05:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said they're not
disputing the contents

05:01.600 --> 05:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of what we reported
the last thing mark

05:04.300 --> 05:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mazzetti is I think the striking

05:05.966 --> 05:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
criticism the
president is making of

05:08.233 --> 05:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
James Comey originally
it was a fairly

05:11.866 --> 05:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mild criticism it's
gravitated all the

05:14.133 --> 05:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way to he was a quote
real nutjob yeah

05:17.766 --> 05:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and you know we now
by now know how the

05:20.500 --> 05:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president speaks or
tweets so you know

05:24.166 --> 05:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
frankly none of that the

05:25.566 --> 05:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
characterization
sounded like it was off

05:27.433 --> 05:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
base you could you
could certainly hear

05:28.900 --> 05:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president making
a comment like that

05:31.000 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Mazzetti with
the New York Times we

05:33.633 --> 05:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thanks very much
okay thank you and we

05:36.233 --> 05:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
turn now to our own White House

05:37.500 --> 05:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
correspondent John
yang so John you've

05:39.933 --> 05:41.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been absorbed

05:41.200 --> 05:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this New York Times
story separately as

05:42.633 --> 05:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we said The Washington
Post has a story

05:45.100 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about a senior advisor
to the president

05:47.033 --> 05:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
currently in the
White House who is now

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a quote person of
interest in this

05:52.000 --> 05:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia investigation
that's right Judy

05:53.700 --> 05:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the significance of
this is this is the

05:55.166 --> 05:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first time that
someone still in the

05:57.633 --> 06:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration is
being reported to be a

06:00.266 --> 06:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
person of interest
in this investigation

06:01.800 --> 06:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before we knew about
subpoenas for Mike

06:04.700 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Flynn the fired
national security

06:06.933 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
adviser and for Paul
Manafort the former

06:09.733 --> 06:11.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chairman of the
campaign but this is the

06:11.733 --> 06:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first time they're
describing this as

06:13.166 --> 06:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
someone close to the
president but the

06:15.733 --> 06:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
post said that their
source would not

06:17.266 --> 06:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
describe that person
any further give

06:19.766 --> 06:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them any more details
there are also

06:22.233 --> 06:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
indications the post
saying that this

06:24.000 --> 06:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation is
beginning to intensify

06:26.466 --> 06:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moving to a new
phase of actually

06:28.800 --> 06:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interviewing witnesses
issuing subpoenas

06:31.700 --> 06:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
using a grand jury
to investigate an

06:34.533 --> 06:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issue those subpoenas
so that this is

06:36.633 --> 06:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
beginning to move
Sean Spicer responded

06:38.933 --> 06:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the Post story
saying as he has since

06:41.433 --> 06:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this began that any
investigation will

06:43.700 --> 06:45.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
prove that there
was no collusion

06:45.833 --> 06:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between the campaign
and any other

06:47.900 --> 06:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government and
John of course it's

06:49.433 --> 06:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
striking all this
coming out just within

06:51.033 --> 06:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a couple of hours
after the president

06:52.233 --> 06:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
takes off on Air Force
One for his first

06:54.666 --> 06:57.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
overseas trip this
has been some week

06:57.900 --> 07:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the White House
you you've been

07:00.266 --> 07:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there every day how
are they dealing

07:01.900 --> 07:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with this they
generally know it's

07:03.566 --> 07:05.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interesting because
the this has been a

07:05.466 --> 07:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chaotic beginning to
this administration

07:07.800 --> 07:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but the people I
talked to acknowledge

07:09.700 --> 07:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the past two weeks and this week

07:11.133 --> 07:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
especially does feel different

07:12.866 --> 07:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the the sort
of the the bombshell

07:16.433 --> 07:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
revelations every day
every afternoon it

07:20.933 --> 07:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just keeps coming
now that you saw a

07:22.666 --> 07:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
little bit of a
difference in the

07:24.033 --> 07:25.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
response this week
which I thought was

07:25.533 --> 07:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interesting when
the New York Times

07:27.700 --> 07:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
broke the story
about the Comey memo

07:29.433 --> 07:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about saying that the
that the president

07:32.866 --> 07:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
asked for his his
loyalties personal

07:36.466 --> 07:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loyalty there really
was there was a

07:38.600 --> 07:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paper statement but
then that was it you

07:41.133 --> 07:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't see anybody
going out to defend

07:43.533 --> 07:46.233 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the president or
to to give their

07:46.233 --> 07:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
version on television
after that there

07:48.700 --> 07:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was even someone
bought Kellyanne Conway

07:50.566 --> 07:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was booked on Fox
to do that but then

07:52.900 --> 07:54.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
canceled

07:54.066 --> 07:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all of its interesting
John yang thank

07:56.066 --> 07:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you and we're going
to get the analysis

the scandal spilled into the

presidential race
when the FBI found

08:18.866 --> 08:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some of Hillary

sunshine Julian
Assange emerged briefly

09:04.133 --> 09:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the embassy
that's been his home

09:06.166 --> 09:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and prison there
was a gesture that

09:08.933 --> 09:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reflected the fact that one

09:10.200 --> 09:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation into
him had been dropped

09:12.333 --> 09:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but rather than
celebratory his words

09:14.933 --> 09:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be seven years
without charge why

09:21.100 --> 09:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my children grew up
without me that is

09:26.566 --> 09:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not something that
I can forgive it is

09:29.600 --> 09:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not something that I
can forget his mood

09:33.800 --> 09:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not helped by the
Metropolitan Police

saying he still
faces arrest if he

09:38.266 --> 09:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaves his refuge the
saga began in 2010

09:41.633 --> 09:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when WikiLeaks released
vast amounts of

09:43.666 --> 09:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
American secrets in
November a Swedish

09:46.233 --> 09:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
international arrest
warrant was issued

09:47.633 --> 09:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
following allegations
that he committed

09:49.966 --> 09:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sex offenses there
he was detained in

09:52.433 --> 09:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
London and jailed but
later bailed where

09:55.333 --> 09:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he fought a series
of court cases before

09:57.433 --> 09:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eventually losing his
extradition battle

09:59.466 --> 10:00.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years later

10:00.666 --> 10:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fearing deportation
to America from

Sweden

10:04.066 --> 10:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he quickly fled
to the Ecuadorian

10:05.300 --> 10:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Embassy where he's
been ever since

10:07.533 --> 10:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
okay that's it thanks
guys tonight he is

10:11.166 --> 10:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still there back out
of sight while his

10:14.000 --> 10:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legal team tried
to negotiate a deal

10:15.966 --> 10:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will allow him
to travel to the

10:17.866 --> 10:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
airport and on to
Ecuador this balcony

10:21.433 --> 10:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is just six foot
above street level but

10:23.900 --> 10:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Julian Assange fears
if he steps down

10:25.966 --> 10:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here where I am he'll
be arrested very

10:28.700 --> 10:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
quickly and put on
a plane to America

10:31.533 --> 10:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for now no sign of a
breakthrough in the

10:34.633 --> 10:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
impasse the world's
cameras still wait

10:37.133 --> 10:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a departure
that is not looking

10:39.533 --> 10:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
imminent a UN report meantime is

10:43.266 --> 10:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shedding new light on atrocities

10:45.100 --> 10:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
committed in South Sudan it says

10:47.633 --> 10:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

killed 114 people in a

william brangham

13:23.900 --> 13:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sat down with benjamin with us

editor-in-chief of

13:29.000 --> 13:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

directors dealings
with the president

13:33.000 --> 13:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
during that volatile
period of time

13:35.033 --> 13:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William began by
asking with us about

13:37.700 --> 13:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nature of his
relationship with

13:39.733 --> 13:40.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey

13:40.966 --> 13:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's really simple
we're friends we've

13:43.133 --> 13:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been friends for a long time and

13:45.400 --> 13:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
contrary to a sort
of mythology that has

13:48.300 --> 13:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
developed I'm not
among his closest

13:50.733 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
friends by any means
or one of his sort

13:54.233 --> 13:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of intimate advisers
so I am in no sense

13:59.233 --> 14:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talking at his behest
I'm talking about

14:01.900 --> 14:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it because I read
the New York Times

14:03.500 --> 14:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story the other day
that the president

14:06.133 --> 14:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had asked for a
loyalty oath from him

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that story put
in frankly sharply

14:15.800 --> 14:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
menacing terms a
set of comments and

14:22.266 --> 14:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anecdotes that he
had told me and I saw

14:26.000 --> 14:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them in light of that story very

14:28.133 --> 14:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
differently than the
way I had seen them

14:30.733 --> 14:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before sharply menacing
yeah I think so

14:33.966 --> 14:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and so I thought
about it overnight on

14:37.533 --> 14:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Friday night and
I decided that the

14:40.833 --> 14:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public should know
about what he had

14:44.133 --> 14:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
told me he really
spent an enormous

14:47.066 --> 14:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amount of energy in
the period in which

14:49.700 --> 14:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both he and Trump
were in office trying

14:52.366 --> 14:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to protect the
FBI from political

14:54.833 --> 14:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interference from
the White House

14:56.633 --> 14:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you described commies
concerns as quote

14:59.566 --> 15:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
improper contacts and
interferences from

15:01.700 --> 15:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a group of people
he Comey did not

15:04.766 --> 15:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regard as honorable
what what may give

15:07.433 --> 15:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you that sense that
he didn't view these

15:09.033 --> 15:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people as honorable
people it was

15:11.100 --> 15:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
written on every line
in his face it was

15:14.933 --> 15:19.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a evident in the

15:21.100 --> 15:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disapproving tone
that he took when he

15:25.133 --> 15:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
described them
including the president

15:28.300 --> 15:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
oh very much so the color of the

15:30.833 --> 15:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wallpaper was that
these were not

15:34.166 --> 15:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honorable people and
that protecting the

15:37.933 --> 15:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FBI from them was
his days day job you

15:42.033 --> 15:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
write about the
famous hug when Comey

15:45.233 --> 15:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was asked to come
with a bunch of other

15:47.166 --> 15:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law enforcement
agents to the White

15:49.133 --> 15:50.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House

15:50.300 --> 15:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
soon after the
inauguration yeah so

15:53.266 --> 15:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey really did not
want to go to that

15:55.500 --> 15:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meeting and there were a lot of

15:57.433 --> 15:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats who kind
of blame him for

15:59.200 --> 16:01.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump so he was
particularly sensitive

16:01.400 --> 16:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the idea of a sort of show of

16:04.433 --> 16:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
intimacy or closeness
with Trump that

16:08.600 --> 16:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said he didn't feel
that he could say no

16:10.866 --> 16:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to an invitation
from the president

16:12.666 --> 16:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
particularly one that
went generally to

16:16.033 --> 16:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law enforcement
senior officials he

16:18.966 --> 16:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really wanted to
kind of blend in and

16:22.400 --> 16:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not be singled out
and he's a he's six

16:25.866 --> 16:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
foot eight so it's
when you're kind of

16:27.466 --> 16:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tough to do six but
eight it's really

16:29.466 --> 16:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hard to blend in
and he stands in the

16:32.166 --> 16:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part of the room
that is as far from

16:34.266 --> 16:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump as it is
physically possible to be

16:36.766 --> 16:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and also against
blue drapes he chose

16:40.133 --> 16:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that spot he chose
that spot because it

16:42.866 --> 16:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was you know like almost like a

16:45.233 --> 16:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chameleon and then
at the end right at

16:48.100 --> 16:49.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the end

16:49.300 --> 16:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump singles him
out in a fashion that

16:51.466 --> 16:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he regarded as sort of you know

16:53.833 --> 16:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calculated to maximally
drive home this

16:58.433 --> 17:01.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this sensitivity among
Democratic voters

17:01.800 --> 17:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's become more
famous than me on he

17:04.566 --> 17:06.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
extends his hand
kind of preemptively

17:06.566 --> 17:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Trump grabs the
canned and kind of

17:09.433 --> 17:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pulls him into a
hug but the hug is

17:12.066 --> 17:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entirely one-sided
and Comey was just

17:15.833 --> 17:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
completely disgusted
by the episode he

17:18.066 --> 17:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thought it was an
intentional attempt to

17:20.133 --> 17:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compromise him in
public in a way that

17:25.866 --> 17:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would that would so

17:29.533 --> 17:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and emphasize concerns
that half of the

17:33.233 --> 17:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
electorate had about
him and the bureau

17:35.633 --> 17:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you also recount a
story of when rod

17:38.733 --> 17:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rosenstein who is now the Deputy

17:40.366 --> 17:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Attorney General was
being nominated or

17:43.133 --> 17:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about to have his
hearings can you

17:44.733 --> 17:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
explain you know
rod Rosenstein is a

17:46.900 --> 17:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
respected career
prosecutor who's been

17:49.600 --> 17:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in government a long
time and served in

17:52.133 --> 17:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both the Bush and
Obama administrations

17:54.466 --> 17:58.000 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and I was rather
surprised at how

17:58.000 --> 18:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unenthusiastic Comey
was that there was

18:01.633 --> 18:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be a
senate-confirmed Deputy

18:04.566 --> 18:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Attorney General and what he

18:05.933 --> 18:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
specifically said
was and I'll never

18:07.833 --> 18:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
forget it he said
rod as a survivor

18:09.800 --> 18:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meaning he's lived
through Democratic

18:12.200 --> 18:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Republican
administrations yeah and

18:14.533 --> 18:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know you don't
get to survive that

18:17.066 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
long without making
some compromises and

18:21.300 --> 18:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so he said I have so
I have concerns and

18:24.233 --> 18:26.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think what he was
thinking at that

18:26.666 --> 18:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moment was that if I
was asked to give a

18:30.433 --> 18:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loyalty oath and the
president has done

18:34.166 --> 18:37.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these things to
undermine me and to sort

18:37.000 --> 18:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of bring me into
the fold what was he

18:39.833 --> 18:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
asked to do what
do you make of the

18:42.200 --> 18:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
criticism that many
people have made

18:44.266 --> 18:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about Comey that if
all of these things

18:47.100 --> 18:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were happening to
you if you were asked

18:49.533 --> 18:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a loyalty oath
if the President had

18:51.800 --> 18:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approached you about
dropping the Flint

18:53.566 --> 18:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation if you
felt like they were

18:56.033 --> 18:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
treading uncomfortably
on your territory

18:57.866 --> 19:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why not blow the
whistle why not quit

19:00.666 --> 19:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why not raise more
hell about this if it

19:04.966 --> 19:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was so bad well so
first of all one

19:07.733 --> 19:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possibility is that
it was not so bad

19:10.033 --> 19:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it was and I
actually think there's

19:13.166 --> 19:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some evidence of
this that this was a

19:16.400 --> 19:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
situation that he
thought he was going

19:18.700 --> 19:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to have to manage
but that he could

19:20.566 --> 19:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
handle that and I
think he thought he

19:23.500 --> 19:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had it under control

19:24.600 --> 19:28.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and look each
individual one of these

19:28.600 --> 19:33.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
incidents is an
egregious impropriety

19:34.600 --> 19:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but they are much much worse

19:39.066 --> 19:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in light of the fact
that we know that

19:41.600 --> 19:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when he didn't get
the loyalty oath from

19:44.166 --> 19:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey and these efforts
to kind of bring

19:48.000 --> 19:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him into the fold
failed that he then

19:50.566 --> 19:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turned around and
fired him in the end

19:52.300 --> 19:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why do you think
Trump fired call me

19:54.933 --> 19:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump fired Jim Comey
because the most

19:57.400 --> 19:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dangerous thing in
the world if you're

19:59.800 --> 20:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is a
person who tells the

20:03.700 --> 20:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
truth is dogged you
can't control and

20:08.033 --> 20:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who is as committed
as Comey is to the

20:12.866 --> 20:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
institutional independence of an

20:15.066 --> 20:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organization that
has the power to

20:16.800 --> 20:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigate you

20:39.733 --> 20:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a tightly control
but still hotly

contested presidential
election poll

63,000 polling
places throughout the

NPR's Morning
Edition co-host Steve

21:03.400 --> 21:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Inskeep has been
reporting all week from

21:05.933 --> 21:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iran and I spoke with
him earlier today

21:08.166 --> 21:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I began by asking
him where he was at

21:11.100 --> 21:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that moment and to
remind us who the

21:12.833 --> 21:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
main contenders are
I am in Oh Sania err

21:16.466 --> 21:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shod which is a very
famous mosque here

21:19.000 --> 21:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Tehran it's got
special significance

21:21.366 --> 21:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this city and
it's also tonight a

21:24.066 --> 21:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
polling place that
people behind me are

21:26.633 --> 21:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in line waiting to
vote and if you were

21:29.566 --> 21:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to follow this line
it would go out the

21:31.166 --> 21:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
door down the steps
around the corner

21:33.200 --> 21:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the way down the
block and off into

21:34.866 --> 21:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the darkness and as
I've been driving

21:36.866 --> 21:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
around the city
tonight Judy I've seen

21:39.100 --> 21:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lines like this
all over the city

21:40.766 --> 21:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mosques are polling
places buses are

21:43.633 --> 21:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
polling places there's a lot of

21:45.566 --> 21:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enthusiasm at this
moment for one or

21:48.633 --> 21:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
both of the two
main candidates for

21:51.433 --> 21:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president Hassan
rouhani the incumbent

21:53.333 --> 21:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Annie bream raised
and you wrote today

21:56.666 --> 21:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Steve for NPR that
this election has in

21:59.533 --> 22:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a way come down to
a referendum on the

22:01.466 --> 22:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
incumbent mr. ruhani
what did you mean

22:03.800 --> 22:05.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by that

22:05.033 --> 22:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well it's true in
America too isn't it

22:07.300 --> 22:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when a president
runs for reelection

22:08.700 --> 22:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's really about
the president and

22:10.466 --> 22:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether people are
satisfied with the

22:12.033 --> 22:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
job that he's done
and that's especially

22:13.966 --> 22:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
true in this case
because Hassan rouhani

22:16.633 --> 22:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has been such a
different figure he's

22:19.266 --> 22:21.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not a radical he's
not an outsider he's

22:21.966 --> 22:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been a member of Iran's clerical

22:24.400 --> 22:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
establishment for

22:25.633 --> 22:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decades but he ran
in 2013 on a promise

22:29.566 --> 22:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to begin to open Iran
up to the world to

22:32.500 --> 22:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
improve relations
with other countries

22:33.966 --> 22:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and also to bring
freedom at home he's

22:37.366 --> 22:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been through four
dramatic years in

22:39.033 --> 22:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which he made a
nuclear deal that

22:41.000 --> 22:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
included the United
States along with

22:42.833 --> 22:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other world powers
a profound change in

22:45.800 --> 22:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relations at least
on that one issue

22:47.300 --> 22:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the United States
and there's been

22:50.500 --> 22:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some small signs of
opening here in Iran

22:53.533 --> 22:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as well although
there are people who

22:55.433 --> 22:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are frustrated
that Moore has not

22:57.233 --> 22:58.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happened as well as
people frustrated

22:58.600 --> 23:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the state of
the economy but he's

23:01.366 --> 23:03.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also faced what I'm
reading is a pretty

23:03.666 --> 23:05.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stiff challenge from
the conservative

23:05.766 --> 23:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cleric who's running against him

23:08.133 --> 23:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're both clearance
they're both from

23:11.033 --> 23:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the same world they
both the different

23:13.166 --> 23:14.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
times have been
close to the guy who

23:14.733 --> 23:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
holds the most
power in Iran Iran's

23:17.166 --> 23:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei

23:19.300 --> 23:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who's not up for
reelection by the way

23:21.500 --> 23:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he is not elected by
the people but the

23:23.833 --> 23:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president is rouhani
the someone was

23:26.600 --> 23:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
close to the supreme
leader and then

23:28.500 --> 23:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
positioned himself
as a more moderate

23:30.600 --> 23:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
figure who could try
to change the rut

23:33.133 --> 23:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Iran had
gotten itself in the

23:34.833 --> 23:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
isolation that Iran
had gotten itself in

23:36.966 --> 23:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that's how he
won election and now

23:39.300 --> 23:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every humor IEC is
a figure who has

23:42.100 --> 23:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
positioned himself
is very close to the

23:44.066 --> 23:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Supreme Leader and
he's seen as far more

23:47.100 --> 23:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conservative although
I should add he's

23:49.566 --> 23:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also been very populist
in the way that

23:51.533 --> 23:52.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's campaigned

23:52.733 --> 23:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hammering president
rouhani for the

23:54.300 --> 23:56.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
state of the economy
making promises to

23:56.566 --> 23:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
improve things for
people here by taking

23:59.400 --> 24:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
steps such as
increasing the cash

24:01.666 --> 24:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
payments the small
cash payments that

24:03.733 --> 24:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are given to each
irani and how much our

24:06.633 --> 24:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attitudes toward the
United States the

24:08.766 --> 24:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
US and the nuclear
deal part of this

24:11.166 --> 24:14.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election it is a
part of the election

24:14.366 --> 24:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but only a part
voters who support

24:17.133 --> 24:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rouhani when I've
interviewed them over

24:18.533 --> 24:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the last several
days in different

24:20.266 --> 24:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cities here in Iran
one of the things

24:23.100 --> 24:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they say again and
again that they want

24:24.800 --> 24:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is better relations
with the world and

24:27.166 --> 24:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nuclear deal
is part of them the

24:30.133 --> 24:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nuclear deal is
also part of this

24:31.700 --> 24:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
campaign in a negative
way for president

24:34.200 --> 24:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rouhani because he
made what were seen

24:36.666 --> 24:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as extravagant
promises that if Iran

24:38.866 --> 24:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would only make the
nuclear deal happen

24:41.233 --> 24:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
economic sanctions
would be lifted and

24:43.233 --> 24:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iran's economy which
has been struggling

24:45.500 --> 24:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would improve
economists are impressed

24:48.200 --> 24:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a lot of the
things that he's done

24:49.700 --> 24:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but the unemployment
rate remains very

24:52.400 --> 24:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very high the economy
has not created

24:55.033 --> 24:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs rapidly enough
for a very large

24:58.066 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very young very
rapidly growing and

25:00.733 --> 25:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pretty well-educated
population and

25:02.933 --> 25:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
finally Steve you
mentioned the Supreme

25:04.900 --> 25:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Leader a moment ago
how much does this

25:07.900 --> 25:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election really matter
in the theocracy

25:10.366 --> 25:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Iran is you
know it matters it

25:13.766 --> 25:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doesn't matter totally rouhani's

25:15.833 --> 25:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
election in 2013
brought some change

25:18.600 --> 25:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brought a nuclear deal

25:20.166 --> 25:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brought more openness
and I felt it in

25:22.466 --> 25:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
multiple visits to
Iran over the last

25:24.366 --> 25:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
four years it's a
little more open each

25:27.066 --> 25:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time people people
are a little more

25:29.200 --> 25:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fearless each time
even though it's also

25:31.433 --> 25:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
true that many people have to be

25:32.733 --> 25:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
extremely careful
about what they say or

25:35.366 --> 25:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what they write there
is more openness

25:37.933 --> 25:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there is a tiny bit
more freedom than

25:40.600 --> 25:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there used to be and
rouhani election in

25:43.533 --> 25:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
2013 can be seen as
the reason for that

25:46.633 --> 25:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so you could argue
that this election

25:48.366 --> 25:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
too might bring
change to this country

25:50.900 --> 25:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which has been through
a pretty dramatic

but first how we
continue to wrestle

26:26.700 --> 26:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with American history

26:27.966 --> 26:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
New Orleans is just
the latest city to

26:30.166 --> 26:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
start taking down historical but

26:32.333 --> 26:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
controversial
monuments that many say

26:34.900 --> 26:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
celebrates slavery

anyone else for that
matter to drive by

26:56.833 --> 26:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
property that they
owned occupied by

26:59.933 --> 27:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reverential statutes
of men who fought

27:02.200 --> 27:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to destroy the
country and deny that

27:05.066 --> 27:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
person's humanity
seems perverse the

27:08.033 --> 27:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
city dismantled this
statue in the broad

27:10.666 --> 27:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
light of day but
three others were

27:12.833 --> 27:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recently taken down
under cover of night

27:14.900 --> 27:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with no advance
notice because of

27:17.500 --> 27:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

city contractors

27:19.533 --> 27:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

bulletproof vests and

27:21.633 --> 27:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were guarded by
police snipers it's

27:24.033 --> 27:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cheap it's low it's
how it the cowardly

27:29.000 --> 27:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as ever was cowardice
this is an act of

27:31.700 --> 27:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cowardice and treachery
right here this

27:34.233 --> 27:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is American history
whether you like it

27:35.733 --> 27:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or not this all goes

the removal of the

argued it was an

27:49.700 --> 27:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appropriate response
to the killing of

to today New Orleans

28:05.833 --> 28:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plans to store the
statues until it

28:07.800 --> 28:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
finds an appropriate
location for them

28:09.700 --> 28:12.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but their removal
has angered opponents

28:12.200 --> 28:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who see this as
suppressing or rewriting

28:14.533 --> 28:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
history in the
service of political

28:16.666 --> 28:18.700 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
correctness many
years later when

28:18.700 --> 28:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
historians or
politicians declare a war

28:21.100 --> 28:22.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unjust

28:22.400 --> 28:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immoral does that
negate the ultimate

28:24.533 --> 28:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
price these soldiers
and families paid

28:26.500 --> 28:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
soldiers do not
make policy elected

28:29.133 --> 28:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

28:44.400 --> 28:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
State House passed
HB 71 which would

28:47.266 --> 28:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
require a referendum
before any military

28:49.666 --> 28:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
monument could be
renamed or removed in

28:52.733 --> 28:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a show of defiance
black caucus members

28:54.900 --> 28:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
walked out after the
vote meanwhile last

28:57.766 --> 28:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weekend in
Charlottesville Virginia

28:59.033 --> 29:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
torched barring
protesters including

29:01.633 --> 29:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
white nationalists
Richard Spencer

29:03.166 --> 29:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
marched against the
removal of a robert

Law Center counts more than 700

29:10.500 --> 29:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Confederate monuments
and statues on

29:12.333 --> 29:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
public lands across
the country the vast

29:14.833 --> 29:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
majority of those are
in the south so is

29:18.600 --> 29:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this the right approach
for dealing with

29:20.400 --> 29:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the darker sides
of US history I'm

29:22.500 --> 29:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
joined now by two
men who have wrestled

29:24.800 --> 29:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with this very question
Bryan Stevenson

29:26.833 --> 29:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is founder and executive
director of the

29:29.033 --> 29:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
equal justice initiative

29:30.433 --> 29:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's helping build
a national monument

29:32.033 --> 29:34.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the victims of
lynching in Montgomery

29:34.566 --> 29:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alabama and Walter Isaacson is a

29:36.833 --> 29:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
historian and writer
and president of

29:38.833 --> 29:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Aspen Institute
welcome to you both

29:41.000 --> 29:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Walter I'd like to
start with you first

29:43.033 --> 29:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you are a native of
New Orleans you were

29:45.500 --> 29:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there when they are
bringing Robert Ely

29:47.633 --> 29:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
down off his pedestal
today what do you

29:49.400 --> 29:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make of the city's
moves I think it's

29:52.333 --> 29:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very very good as you say these

29:55.833 --> 29:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Confederate monument
statues were put up

29:59.200 --> 30:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not to honor the
nobility of any of

30:01.833 --> 30:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these people it was
put up in the 1880s

30:04.366 --> 30:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
1890's as a way to
try to reassert white

30:09.166 --> 30:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supremacy New Orleans
has had a 300-year

30:11.833 --> 30:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
history we've just
gone through a

30:13.133 --> 30:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hurricane if you're
going to name the

30:14.933 --> 30:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people we should
have monuments - it's

30:16.966 --> 30:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not Confederate
generals so I think

30:19.466 --> 30:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's a big sigh
of relief today as

30:21.466 --> 30:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the last of these
comes down Bryan

30:24.533 --> 30:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Stevenson what is
your reaction to this

30:26.833 --> 30:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how does this sit
with you well I think

30:29.433 --> 30:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's also very long
overdue and a really

30:31.733 --> 30:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important step for
one of America's

30:34.266 --> 30:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
great cities that wants to be Oh

30:35.900 --> 30:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been and inviting
to all the people of

30:38.000 --> 30:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the world and I
think this legacy of

30:40.900 --> 30:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
racial inequality
and segregation has

30:42.933 --> 30:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really put a cloud
over New Orleans and

30:44.733 --> 30:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these statutes
and monuments have

30:46.333 --> 30:48.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reflected that cloud
more powerfully

30:48.633 --> 30:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than anything these
totems are made of

30:52.700 --> 30:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concrete and steel
and bronze but they

30:54.700 --> 30:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have been screaming
at African Americans

30:57.000 --> 30:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for decades and
what they've been

30:58.266 --> 31:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
screaming is this
narrative of racial

31:00.800 --> 31:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
difference this history of white

31:03.033 --> 31:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supremacy so I
think this is long

31:04.866 --> 31:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
overdue and part of
that has to do with

31:07.500 --> 31:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the legacy and I
don't think the great

31:08.933 --> 31:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
evil of American
slavery was involuntary

31:11.566 --> 31:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
servitude and forced
labor I think the

31:13.433 --> 31:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
real evil of American
slavery was this

31:16.266 --> 31:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
narrative of racial
difference we

31:17.733 --> 31:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
created the ideology
of white supremacy

31:20.300 --> 31:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we made up we
said black people are

31:22.000 --> 31:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
different than white
people they're not

31:23.366 --> 31:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fully human our
courts held that black

31:25.833 --> 31:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people were only
three-fifths human and

31:27.600 --> 31:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our 13th amendment dealt with

31:29.566 --> 31:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involuntary servitude
in forced labor

31:31.400 --> 31:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it didn't deal
with this ideology of

31:34.333 --> 31:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
white supremacy and
because of that I

31:36.300 --> 31:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
don't think slavery
ended in 1865 I

31:38.533 --> 31:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think it just evolved
and the proof of

31:40.966 --> 31:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that was the erection of these

31:43.133 --> 31:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
narratives are
these monuments and

31:45.833 --> 31:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
totems which came
after a violent

31:47.766 --> 31:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resistance as Walter
said to racial

31:50.900 --> 31:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
equality and they've
been there for

31:52.966 --> 31:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decades screaming
that that narrative of

31:55.433 --> 31:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
racial difference
that resistance to the

31:57.366 --> 32:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
end of emancipation
to integration is

32:00.700 --> 32:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something worth
honoring and I think

32:03.266 --> 32:04.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has to change
if we're going to be

32:04.866 --> 32:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a country that makes
progress in dealing

32:07.366 --> 32:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with racial inequality
I would agree

32:09.000 --> 32:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it was good to
have the discussion

32:11.066 --> 32:12.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to Brian

32:12.266 --> 32:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which helped this
city I mean when I was

32:14.100 --> 32:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first has to be on
the try Centennial

32:15.866 --> 32:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Commission down here

32:17.133 --> 32:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wynton marsalis said
I'll do it with you

32:19.400 --> 32:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if we take down robert
e lee and i said

32:22.233 --> 32:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well i never paid
much attention to

32:24.300 --> 32:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
robert e lee when
you go around lee

32:25.833 --> 32:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
circle and went and
said i did we did

32:29.333 --> 32:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that helped us
do a dialogue down

32:31.633 --> 32:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here which now is
pretty complete but

32:34.833 --> 32:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
walter you heard
you heard brian say

32:36.866 --> 32:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they were
screaming that these

32:38.300 --> 32:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statues were screaming
about inequality

32:40.700 --> 32:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and and white superiority
there's also a

32:43.100 --> 32:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
great deal of screaming
that people who

32:44.566 --> 32:46.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are furious that
these monuments are

32:46.633 --> 32:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming down I mean
how is a mayor or a

32:48.800 --> 32:50.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
governor and

32:50.100 --> 32:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're in the country
supposed to wrestle

32:51.633 --> 32:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with that very real
boiling anger over

32:54.666 --> 32:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these exact moves
well I think what

32:57.733 --> 32:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happened here in New
Orleans is we spent

32:59.233 --> 33:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of time talking
about it and the

33:01.233 --> 33:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anger especially
among local citizens

33:03.433 --> 33:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
receded I think
there's a willingness

33:05.666 --> 33:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now to put this behind
as I said I just

33:07.900 --> 33:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
came from Lee Circle
there's a brass

33:09.700 --> 33:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
band they're playing
the national anthem

33:12.233 --> 33:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that once we
had this catharsis

33:15.633 --> 33:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of talking about it
there were people

33:17.800 --> 33:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who protested the
monuments coming down

33:19.933 --> 33:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but they were all
outsiders who had come

33:22.466 --> 33:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in from these weird
groups around the

33:25.100 --> 33:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country in New Orleans
right now it was

33:27.700 --> 33:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a day time very
peaceful thing to get

33:31.000 --> 33:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this Monument down

33:32.466 --> 33:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I think the whole
process of talking

33:35.433 --> 33:38.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it through and
realizing that we don't

33:38.133 --> 33:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need to put the Confederacy on a

33:39.666 --> 33:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pedestal in New
Orleans which was it

33:42.000 --> 33:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even you know part
of the Civil War

33:44.266 --> 33:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really Brian one of
the other criticism

33:47.566 --> 33:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's been brought
up is the potential

33:49.766 --> 33:51.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a slippery slope
here which is where

33:51.866 --> 33:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do we stop I mean
I'm talking to you

33:53.633 --> 33:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Washington DC we have the

33:55.233 --> 33:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Washington Monument

33:56.666 --> 33:58.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have Jefferson's
Memorial we have

33:58.766 --> 34:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
monuments all over
the country that

34:02.166 --> 34:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honor people who
held slaves how do we

34:04.633 --> 34:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where do we draw
the line as to what

34:06.866 --> 34:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stays and what goes
well I think it's

34:09.733 --> 34:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
important to have a
conversation about

34:11.533 --> 34:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what we honor and
why but I think

34:14.233 --> 34:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's a huge
difference between robert

34:16.033 --> 34:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
e lee and jefferson
davis and people who

34:18.000 --> 34:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were the architects
and defenders of

34:19.500 --> 34:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
slavery people who were actually

34:22.233 --> 34:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
considered traitors
and treasonous many

34:25.000 --> 34:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of whom thought
should be hanged after

34:26.600 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Civil War and
I think it's just a

34:29.200 --> 34:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
radical difference
between what we see

34:31.633 --> 34:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the American South
and we have states

34:33.966 --> 34:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like my state of Alabama where

34:36.300 --> 34:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Confederate Memorial
Day is a state

34:38.166 --> 34:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
holiday where Jefferson
Davis's birthday

34:40.766 --> 34:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a state holiday
that's very far away

34:43.233 --> 34:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the conversations
that we're having

34:45.466 --> 34:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in other parts of
the country and I

34:47.133 --> 34:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think it does
matter we talk about

34:49.500 --> 34:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memorials a lot we
have a 9/11 memorial

34:52.133 --> 34:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this country because
what happened on

34:54.133 --> 34:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
9/11 was significant
to the nation to

34:56.400 --> 34:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
its history to
its culture and we

34:58.366 --> 35:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believed in the
power of memorials to

35:00.400 --> 35:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say something about
who we are that

35:02.133 --> 35:03.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doesn't mean

35:03.133 --> 35:05.533 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that if a nation
put up a statute

35:05.533 --> 35:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honouring Osama bin
Laden we would think

35:07.966 --> 35:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that that's
acceptable we would be

35:09.333 --> 35:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
absolutely provoked
by that and so there

35:11.700 --> 35:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a way to think
about what we honor

35:13.700 --> 35:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that reflects who
we are what we think

35:16.333 --> 35:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is significant the
greatest person of

35:18.333 --> 35:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most influential
person of the 20th

35:20.166 --> 35:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
century was arguably
Adolf Hitler that

35:22.100 --> 35:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn't mean that
there should be

35:23.333 --> 35:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statutes of him in
Germany we'd be very

35:25.566 --> 35:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
provoked by that
and so I do think we

35:27.933 --> 35:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have to ask hard
questions and I think

35:29.733 --> 35:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the question of
the Confederacy and

35:31.700 --> 35:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the architects and
defenders of white

35:33.800 --> 35:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
supremacy symbols
of resistance to

35:36.466 --> 35:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
integration there
should be no debate we

35:38.566 --> 35:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cannot move forward
if we actually think

35:40.633 --> 35:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's something
acceptable about

35:42.400 --> 35:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
honoring that legacy
Walter what do you

35:44.533 --> 35:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make of that is there is there a

35:45.933 --> 35:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slippery slope is
there a line that's

35:47.566 --> 35:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clear to you as well
as to what stays

35:49.600 --> 35:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and what goes you
know William all

35:52.533 --> 35:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
slopes are slippery

35:54.766 --> 35:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's why you try
to find a moral

35:56.600 --> 35:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
footing Brian got it
right you say what

35:59.533 --> 36:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was the purpose of
this memorial we have

36:02.266 --> 36:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a memorial in this
city right behind me

36:04.500 --> 36:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look over my shoulder
to Andrew Jackson

36:06.666 --> 36:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's because and
it was put up at 1840

36:10.300 --> 36:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the square where
Jackson statue is

36:13.333 --> 36:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's where he
mustered the troops to

36:15.600 --> 36:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
win the Battle of
New Orleans so that

36:17.700 --> 36:21.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memorial is there to
honor that he was a

36:21.366 --> 36:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad slave owner he
had a lot wrong with

36:24.000 --> 36:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him but you have to
say is this a sig is

36:26.300 --> 36:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this a symbol of
white supremacy and

36:29.000 --> 36:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Confederacy and
traitorous or is it

36:31.900 --> 36:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because he won the
Battle of New Orleans

36:33.900 --> 36:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people say things are
slippery slopes of

36:36.333 --> 36:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
course they're
slippery slopes that's

36:38.700 --> 36:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why you have moral
arguments to say

36:40.433 --> 36:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where do I put my
footing where do I try

36:42.433 --> 36:44.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to draw the line
all right Walter

36:44.600 --> 36:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Isaacson Bryan
Stevenson thank you both

36:46.433 --> 36:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very much thank you thanks

[Music]

37:01.333 --> 37:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now back to the swirl of news

37:03.866 --> 37:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surrounding the
White House the FBI's

37:06.100 --> 37:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia probe and more
with the analysis

shields and New York

37:12.866 --> 37:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Times columnist
David Brooks welcome

37:15.900 --> 37:18.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gentlemen so much
to talk about what a

37:18.533 --> 37:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
week I don't even
know where to begin I

37:20.500 --> 37:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will mention that
cNN has just been

37:22.233 --> 37:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reporting in the
last few minutes that

37:23.733 --> 37:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they have from
several sources that

37:25.933 --> 37:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House lawyers
are beginning to at

37:28.133 --> 37:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
least research the mechanism of

37:30.933 --> 37:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
impeachment they
don't have reason to

37:32.533 --> 37:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe the story
says that anything

37:34.666 --> 37:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like that's going
to happen soon but

37:36.100 --> 37:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they are looking into
it but David this

37:39.133 --> 37:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
week there again
there's so much to talk

37:40.733 --> 37:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about but let's talk about the

37:41.900 --> 37:43.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appointment of a
special counsel robert

37:43.766 --> 37:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
muller the former
FBI director in the

37:45.600 --> 37:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
midst of this all
this speculation about

37:50.300 --> 37:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russia connection
what does this do

37:53.733 --> 37:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the cloud hanging
over the White

37:56.400 --> 37:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House well it's
interesting that after a

37:58.966 --> 38:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
year spent campaigning
against the

38:01.133 --> 38:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insiders the swamp the beltway

38:03.000 --> 38:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
establishment that
when you get a big

38:04.933 --> 38:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
crisis everyone wants
somebody with some

38:06.500 --> 38:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience and some
credibility and so

38:09.433 --> 38:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this appointment
has been greeted I

38:11.200 --> 38:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think by Republicans
in Congress by

38:13.533 --> 38:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republic by Democrats
by most of the

38:15.400 --> 38:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country as a sign of
okay finally we're

38:17.233 --> 38:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gonna get some
straight answers and it

38:19.166 --> 38:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strikes me is
absolutely necessary I

38:20.533 --> 38:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean today's story
from from nine

38:21.900 --> 38:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
newspaper that he
told the Russians that

38:24.566 --> 38:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he got really call me to relieve

38:26.133 --> 38:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pressure you know
we used to have a

38:28.100 --> 38:29.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better class of
criminal where if you

38:29.900 --> 38:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obstructed justice
you tried to hide it

38:31.466 --> 38:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he's going
around bragging on

38:33.200 --> 38:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
national TV and
then bragging to our

38:35.100 --> 38:36.500 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
adversaries that
he's obstructing

38:36.500 --> 38:37.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
justice

38:37.733 --> 38:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so whether or not
he's obstructed

38:39.600 --> 38:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
justice he certainly
seems to be acting

38:41.300 --> 38:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like he did and that
certainly justifies

38:43.600 --> 38:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a special counsel
what do you make of a

38:45.766 --> 38:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
special counsel
pick I think it's a

38:47.966 --> 38:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lifesaver for
Republicans I really do I

38:51.566 --> 38:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
think and it's a cold water for

38:54.033 --> 38:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
congressional inquiries
we went through

38:56.966 --> 39:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Rand Carter
hearings and Ollie North

39:00.700 --> 39:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who was one of the
central figures was

39:02.233 --> 39:05.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
convicted of three
felonies and in fact

39:05.766 --> 39:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that was overturned
because of immunity

39:08.433 --> 39:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had been given to
witnesses and that

39:10.133 --> 39:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that testimony had
compromised the

39:13.666 --> 39:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his own defense well
you know its own

39:16.033 --> 39:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
defense so ever since
then there's been

39:18.800 --> 39:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an apprehension early
rhiness about in

39:21.566 --> 39:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any way affecting or
shaping a criminal

39:25.633 --> 39:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation national security

39:27.100 --> 39:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation is the
kind of Robert MOA

39:29.733 --> 39:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very respected former
FBI director 13

39:32.966 --> 39:36.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years is about to
launch so I think

39:36.466 --> 39:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they'll be we won't
see Paul Manafort we

39:39.833 --> 39:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
won't see Roger
stone we won't see

39:41.533 --> 39:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carter page in public
I doubt very much

39:45.166 --> 39:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the hearings
will go forward but

39:47.566 --> 39:49.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not on the Senate
and the Senate in the

39:49.433 --> 39:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate in the house
but not not with the

39:51.233 --> 39:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
same the same kind of intensity

39:54.033 --> 39:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perhaps just just
passion that we've had

40:00.233 --> 40:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and for Republicans
it takes it off the

40:02.633 --> 40:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
front page and it
it guarantees that

40:07.400 --> 40:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's going to be an
investigation but

40:10.366 --> 40:13.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's no timetable
and and let's be

40:13.500 --> 40:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very frank I mean
Bob mullah is a

40:15.166 --> 40:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consensus all-american
choice here he

40:18.166 --> 40:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really is I think
it's hard to criticize

40:19.733 --> 40:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him I disagree with
one thing I'd okay

40:21.733 --> 40:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's going to off
the front page I mean

40:23.300 --> 40:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well not if we
continue to have the

40:24.966 --> 40:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president telling the
Russians something

40:27.066 --> 40:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that 16 hours earlier
his people had

40:29.466 --> 40:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
told the American
people they did it

40:30.700 --> 40:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because of Hillary
Clinton's emails and

40:32.600 --> 40:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
call me and they only
fired the commies

40:34.700 --> 40:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
firing and that
16 hours later he

40:36.733 --> 40:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privately tells
the Russians when

40:39.166 --> 40:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's no American
press around I think

40:40.933 --> 40:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what a couple things
happened this week

40:42.233 --> 40:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one is the special
counsel you know a

40:44.433 --> 40:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
couple of the Russian
thing there's an

40:46.033 --> 40:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
investigation of
person interest but to

40:47.866 --> 40:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me the most interesting
thing is that

40:50.166 --> 40:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the White House staff
and the the people

40:52.433 --> 40:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under Donald Trump
at least some portion

40:54.066 --> 40:55.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of them or some
large portion of them

40:55.600 --> 40:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seem to have turned
against Donald Trump

40:57.200 --> 40:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have not talked
to our reporters who

40:59.366 --> 41:01.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
broke this story
but if I read it

41:01.266 --> 41:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
correctly some
senior administration

41:03.533 --> 41:05.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
official with top
secret clearance read

41:05.733 --> 41:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the readout to a reporter that's

41:07.666 --> 41:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
breaking the law and
that's doing it in

41:11.200 --> 41:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a way because you
think you need to be

41:13.100 --> 41:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deep throat you need
to undermine this

41:15.200 --> 41:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guy you need to tell
get the truth out

41:16.666 --> 41:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about this guy and in the Nixon

41:19.033 --> 41:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration there
were a couple deep

41:20.866 --> 41:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
throats there was a
guy off in the FBI

41:22.600 --> 41:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who was willing to
leave but in this

41:24.466 --> 41:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration they
seem to be in every

41:26.333 --> 41:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closet and behind every

41:27.566 --> 41:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm exaggerating a
little but there are

41:29.333 --> 41:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
squads of deep throats
and so that means

41:31.966 --> 41:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this story is not only a legal

41:33.533 --> 41:34.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation

41:34.466 --> 41:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's a dis dissolution of an

41:36.333 --> 41:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration and
and mark talking

41:38.833 --> 41:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about not only
talking about what the

41:40.900 --> 41:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President had to
say about Comey but

41:43.000 --> 41:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also sharing the fact
that the president

41:45.266 --> 41:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shared intelligence
with the Russian

41:48.533 --> 41:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
intelligence where
there is a remarkable

41:50.266 --> 41:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
story in and of itself
I could not agree

41:52.500 --> 41:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with you more Judy
I mean and the what

41:54.566 --> 41:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
looked like a generous
offer by Vladimir

41:56.600 --> 42:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Putin that I'll make
it available to you

42:00.366 --> 42:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the minutes of the
meeting you know

42:02.400 --> 42:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turns out really to
be a veiled threat

42:04.300 --> 42:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because I mean the
revelation of the

42:07.300 --> 42:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
minutes of that
meeting are devastating

42:09.266 --> 42:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they devastate
the administration

42:10.600 --> 42:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
picking up on what
David said I don't

42:12.566 --> 42:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think there's any
question that this is

42:13.966 --> 42:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a body blow to this
administration I

42:16.433 --> 42:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
won't say it's dead
men walking but it's

42:18.833 --> 42:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you cannot pass a
legislative program on

42:22.000 --> 42:23.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Capitol Hill

42:23.266 --> 42:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially when it's
controversial where

42:24.900 --> 42:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president who
has absolutely no

42:27.700 --> 42:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attention span no
clout no credibility

42:30.633 --> 42:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and his is diminished
to the point where

42:34.533 --> 42:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is just nothing
believable that's

42:37.200 --> 42:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming out of this
way substantively

42:38.833 --> 42:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's sort of what's
happened we've had

42:40.933 --> 42:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration's
that have had big

42:42.500 --> 42:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scandals before but the Nixon

42:44.266 --> 42:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration by
the time the scandal

42:45.666 --> 42:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hit they had a very
qualified White

42:47.800 --> 42:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House staff and all
these agencies named

42:49.800 --> 42:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Clinton same
with Reagan with this

42:51.733 --> 42:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration they've
imploded before

42:53.233 --> 42:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they've had time to staff up and

42:54.933 --> 42:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
therefore they do not
have people in the

42:57.500 --> 42:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the jobs to do
the normal work of

42:59.566 --> 43:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration and
at this point who's

43:01.500 --> 43:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to want to go
into those jobs no

43:03.000 --> 43:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one is going to want
to go to those jobs

43:04.366 --> 43:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so whatever happens with the

43:05.733 --> 43:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigation were looking at an

43:07.433 --> 43:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration
that will be poorly

43:08.933 --> 43:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staffed or unstaffed
trying to run the

43:11.833 --> 43:14.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country and and Mark
you mentioned how

43:14.200 --> 43:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do you get anything
done although I will

43:15.500 --> 43:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say I heard Paul
Ryan talk give a talk

43:18.600 --> 43:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last night and he
said this is all what

43:20.666 --> 43:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he called white
noise he said we're

43:22.466 --> 43:23.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to focus on
the business of the

43:23.900 --> 43:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country we're going
to work on getting

43:25.700 --> 43:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care done then
we're going to do

43:27.333 --> 43:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tax reform later
than the tax reform

43:30.466 --> 43:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bill is okay and
it's why I guess it's

43:33.100 --> 43:35.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the infrastructure
bill and we're

43:35.500 --> 43:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approaching Memorial
Day Judy and if

43:37.566 --> 43:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there isn't a health
care bill by the

43:39.400 --> 43:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fourth of July out of the Senate

43:41.300 --> 43:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that that's on
life-support if it

43:43.333 --> 43:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perhaps even beyond
so then then you're

43:45.266 --> 43:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a Republican and
you're running and even

43:47.066 --> 43:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Paul Ryan and
it's a lovely man but

43:49.500 --> 43:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you're running in
2018 and now it's

43:51.500 --> 43:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be nothing
but a referendum on

43:53.000 --> 43:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump you
won't even have a

43:54.766 --> 43:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
legislative program
to be able go back

43:57.400 --> 44:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and talk about I mean
you know it's it I

44:01.200 --> 44:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cannot overstate how
unbelievable would

44:05.033 --> 44:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Willie this administration
has become I

44:07.566 --> 44:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mean you know it
was said that George

44:10.733 --> 44:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington was the
president could never

44:11.933 --> 44:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tell a lie and
Richard Nixon was the

44:13.733 --> 44:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president could
never tell the truth

44:15.633 --> 44:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is truly
the president who

44:17.633 --> 44:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't tell the
difference I mean he

44:19.133 --> 44:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changes his story as
he did last week on

44:22.100 --> 44:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russian meeting
and on the firing of

44:25.366 --> 44:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jim Comey depending
upon whom he's

44:27.966 --> 44:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talking to whether
it's NBC or whether

44:31.066 --> 44:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's his own staff
and picking up on

44:33.833 --> 44:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David's point about
the staff Judy the

44:35.900 --> 44:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
morale is just
absolutely at low ebb

44:39.000 --> 44:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're now facing legal fees

44:41.233 --> 44:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I remember Maggie
Williams who was

44:42.766 --> 44:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton's
chief of staff facing

44:44.666 --> 44:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over $300,000 in legal fees

44:47.633 --> 44:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everybody's lawyer
up just sitting at a

44:49.633 --> 44:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meeting now is David
talking to somebody

44:52.166 --> 44:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else I mean it's
just distrust it's an

44:54.833 --> 44:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
awful situation
well to add a little

44:56.966 --> 44:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fuel to the fire
I'm being told right

44:58.366 --> 45:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now by our executive
producer Sarah just

45:00.366 --> 45:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there's a report
that the Senate

45:02.033 --> 45:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Intelligence Committee
chair and vice

45:04.633 --> 45:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chair Richard Burr
of North Carolina

45:06.266 --> 45:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Warner of
Virginia are announcing

45:08.166 --> 45:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Jim Comey the
fired FBI director

45:11.166 --> 45:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has agreed to testify
an open session I

45:13.400 --> 45:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think I'm hearing
that correctly I don't

45:15.166 --> 45:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't have who
it's coming from I

45:17.166 --> 45:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gather it's coming
from the Senate so

45:19.166 --> 45:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will be
that'll be something

45:21.800 --> 45:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
everybody Beulah
that'll be me we just

45:23.266 --> 45:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
served been with
us earlier in the

45:24.633 --> 45:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
program with his
interpretation would

45:26.500 --> 45:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
call me thinks hear
directly from Comey

45:28.900 --> 45:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be a cinematic
Cecil B DeMille

45:32.333 --> 45:35.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
moment I don't
witness comments about

45:35.566 --> 45:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how he he about how
Comey felt about the

45:39.366 --> 45:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president pulling
him over yes pulling

45:41.433 --> 45:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him into a hug yeah

45:43.100 --> 45:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the contemporaneous
memos that he

45:45.800 --> 45:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obviously kept from
those experiences

45:48.833 --> 45:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interactions with
the president and

45:50.933 --> 45:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
remember this Judy
Jim Comey as FBI

45:53.933 --> 45:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
director there are

45:55.133 --> 45:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
subject areas he
couldn't discuss before

45:57.833 --> 46:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the intelligence
kameena now Donald

46:00.100 --> 46:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump has opened
up Donald Trump has

46:02.433 --> 46:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made it possible he's
no longer the FBI

46:04.200 --> 46:06.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
director and he's
all he's doing is

46:06.366 --> 46:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responding to charges
I'm substantiate

46:10.033 --> 46:11.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
according to Jim
call me that Donald

46:11.800 --> 46:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump has made about
so this this is a

46:14.600 --> 46:16.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if in fact the
Senate Intelligence

46:16.533 --> 46:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Committee hearings
are open and Jim

46:18.500 --> 46:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Comey is there it
will be a rating

46:21.500 --> 46:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bonanza coincidence
that Donald Trump we

46:24.266 --> 46:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
learned called him
enough job a few

46:25.566 --> 46:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hours ago and now
this comes up is it

46:27.700 --> 46:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but but but David
this is just as as we

46:30.666 --> 46:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said the president
has just taken off on

46:32.500 --> 46:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this big nine day
first overseas trip

46:34.933 --> 46:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's going to the
Middle East he's

46:36.500 --> 46:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meeting with the
leaders of so many

46:37.866 --> 46:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
European countries
does life go on in

46:41.333 --> 46:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some way respects
in this country in

46:43.533 --> 46:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this city while all
this is happening in

46:45.400 --> 46:46.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
my contacts with
the Trump people

46:46.833 --> 46:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compartmentalization
is high and guys

46:49.833 --> 46:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are good at it I
don't know maybe but

46:51.400 --> 46:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but but they they
would like to pretend

46:54.333 --> 46:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is not happening
but at the as Mark

46:57.000 --> 46:58.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said they can't in
their heart of hearts

46:58.766 --> 47:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be sanguine about it
because there a lot

47:01.233 --> 47:03.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of them are leaking
a lot of them don't

47:03.200 --> 47:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know who's going
to write the memoir

47:04.433 --> 47:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against each another
a lot of them are

47:05.933 --> 47:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be under
investigation some of

47:07.533 --> 47:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them you know
there's a target of

47:08.966 --> 47:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interest in the
White House and right

47:10.400 --> 47:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now according to the
Washington Post in

47:11.766 --> 47:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Russia inquiry
and so they can't

47:13.833 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ignore all that but
they're trying to

47:15.633 --> 47:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pretend that all is
normal and I think

47:18.666 --> 47:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is the pretense
that they're trying

47:20.266 --> 47:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pull off mark
you've been in the city

47:22.233 --> 47:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a lot well almost
as long as I know

47:24.500 --> 47:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Julian so but I
heard Henry Hamilton

47:27.300 --> 47:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
yeah how does this
city deal with a

47:30.500 --> 47:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
situation and how
does the country deal

47:32.333 --> 47:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a situation
like this well I mean

47:34.433 --> 47:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we've never had one
like this that there

47:36.366 --> 47:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the first of all
there's no reservoir

47:40.233 --> 47:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of shared experiences with this

47:42.400 --> 47:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president we have
shared values so

47:45.200 --> 47:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you've been through there's no

47:46.433 --> 47:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accomplishment you
can point to and say

47:48.166 --> 47:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
well I'm going to
give them the benefit

47:49.633 --> 47:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the doubt so
that's missing but as

47:51.800 --> 47:53.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
far as the the White
House staff and I

47:53.766 --> 47:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have great sympathy
for people work in

47:55.566 --> 47:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the White House
they work long hours

47:56.866 --> 47:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they they miss
birthday parties they

47:59.066 --> 48:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
miss children's
recitals and what you

48:02.333 --> 48:04.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get what you get
really is a sense that

48:04.266 --> 48:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm involved in
something larger there's

48:06.266 --> 48:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a sense of psychic income and

48:08.600 --> 48:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you've got a boss
who has absolutely no

48:10.466 --> 48:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
loyalty I mean who's
disparaging his

48:13.033 --> 48:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staff who's abusing
his staff according

48:15.500 --> 48:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to reports in major
papers so this this

48:18.200 --> 48:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is just that this
again saps all morale

48:21.433 --> 48:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and and leads to I
don't care if I go to

48:24.133 --> 48:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the meeting in fact
I'd rather not be in

48:25.966 --> 48:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the meeting instead
of please let me in

48:27.633 --> 48:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the meeting so I
I don't see how it

48:30.066 --> 48:31.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continues

48:31.200 --> 48:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really don't
everybody who has been

48:32.633 --> 48:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
associated with
this man has been

48:34.400 --> 48:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diminished has had
his own reputation

48:37.233 --> 48:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether it's
Rosenstein a gentleman

48:39.233 --> 48:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
master whoever it is
they are a smaller

48:41.466 --> 48:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
person for their association

48:42.800 --> 48:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
identification with
Donald Trump but

48:44.133 --> 48:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just quickly David
we started this

48:45.300 --> 48:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conversation talking
about how the

48:46.533 --> 48:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
appointment of Bob
Muller robert muller

48:48.000 --> 48:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the special counsel
has somewhat calm

48:50.166 --> 48:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the waters yeah but
i don't think too

48:52.366 --> 48:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much i did i think
this is now there's a

48:54.133 --> 48:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

reality TV show what

unwinding not a

finally an essay by
author Richard Ford

49:26.366 --> 49:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his latest book between
them is a memoir

49:29.333 --> 49:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of his parents
lives and tonight he

49:31.833 --> 49:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shares his humble
opinion about taking

49:34.233 --> 49:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
note of their love
have ilysm goodness

49:38.733 --> 49:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
knows there are lots
of reasons to write

49:40.400 --> 49:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a memoir to render
testimony to bear

49:43.566 --> 49:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
witness to make sense
of a recollected

49:45.833 --> 49:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life that had
failed to make sense

49:47.433 --> 49:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before to turn to
the mysteries of

49:49.833 --> 49:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memory and provides
the continuous

49:51.700 --> 49:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
narrative of our
own life and in that

49:53.566 --> 49:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way substantiate
ourselves to ourselves

49:55.900 --> 49:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and others said
Augustine told us memory

49:59.900 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a Faculty of
the soul writing a

50:02.766 --> 50:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memoir about my
parents Parker and Edna

50:05.000 --> 50:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ford didn't seem to
be so much writing

50:07.333 --> 50:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about myself as
about them although I

50:10.300 --> 50:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was their only child
and the only one

50:12.666 --> 50:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
remaining to say that
they even existed

50:14.800 --> 50:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so here is another
reason to write a

50:16.833 --> 50:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memoir to utter what
must not be erased

50:19.733 --> 50:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wrote about my
parents because decades

50:23.366 --> 50:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after their deaths
and when I was no

50:25.133 --> 50:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
longer young I
realized that I plainly

50:28.233 --> 50:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
missed them and
wished in some way to

50:30.733 --> 50:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
draw them near me
again writing about

50:33.833 --> 50:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them would do that I
thought it is worth

50:36.066 --> 50:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying such an emotion
missing them is

50:39.166 --> 50:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possible and can be
acted upon even long

50:42.333 --> 50:44.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after it might be
supposed that enough

50:44.466 --> 50:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time has passed for
longing to subside

50:46.933 --> 50:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my parents were
wonderful parents though

50:50.433 --> 50:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other than causing
me to happen and

50:52.466 --> 50:55.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
making each other
blissful for 32 years

50:55.466 --> 50:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they set little in
motion and whereas

50:57.633 --> 50:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
most of our parents are all but

50:59.833 --> 51:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unnoticeable in the world's

51:01.133 --> 51:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disinterested eye
and yet it's fair to

51:03.966 --> 51:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say that because
they were who and how

51:06.200 --> 51:08.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were being
their son seemed a

51:08.600 --> 51:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
privilege and almost
mysteriously they

51:11.533 --> 51:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opened for me a world of immense

51:14.066 --> 51:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possibility the choice
to make fictional

51:16.966 --> 51:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
characters of my
parents which would

51:18.833 --> 51:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seem to be what many
novelists do simply

51:21.766 --> 51:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
didn't occur to me
fictions reliance on

51:24.533 --> 51:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
artifice its
necessity to suspend

51:26.800 --> 51:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
disbelief in order
to assure trust its

51:29.133 --> 51:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
engrossing arbitrariness and its

51:31.500 --> 51:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
foundation and the
provisional all these

51:33.666 --> 51:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
orchestrations of
fiction threatened to

51:35.933 --> 51:37.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overpower my

51:37.100 --> 51:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
parents what I wanted
as their son was

51:40.266 --> 51:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not for disbelief
to be suspended but

51:42.833 --> 51:45.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for it to be abolished
and for belief in

51:45.433 --> 51:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my parents in their
lives to become

51:47.733 --> 51:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
absolute facts with
their blunder more

51:52.733 --> 51:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
specific hold on
truth seemed to me the

51:55.333 --> 51:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better way to
represent my parents as

51:57.200 --> 51:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they were in a better
way for me to say

51:59.900 --> 52:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that because of how
they were not in

52:02.433 --> 52:03.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spite of it

52:03.666 --> 52:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they merited the
world's attention

52:05.433 --> 52:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's worth saying
- age is a winnowing

52:10.200 --> 52:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process and sometimes
what gets sifted

52:13.233 --> 52:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out as we seek to
know the important

52:15.100 --> 52:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
consequence of
lives are the actual

52:17.366 --> 52:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lives themselves
odd to think that we

52:19.900 --> 52:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could even for a
moment overlook such

52:22.233 --> 52:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rudiments or take
them for granted

52:24.666 --> 52:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memoirs for that -
it's great virtue

52:28.266 --> 52:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being to remind
us that in a world

52:30.666 --> 52:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cloaked in supposition
and opinion and

52:33.333 --> 52:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
misdirection and
often an outright

52:35.233 --> 52:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
untruth things do
actually happen my

52:38.900 --> 52:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
parents lives did
take place and it is

52:42.066 --> 52:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here in the
incontrovertible truth that

52:44.133 --> 52:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
facts provide but
our firmest beliefs

52:47.000 --> 52:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
must first take hold
