THIS IS NOT AN EXTENDED AI

CAMPAIGN

02:43.467 --> 02:45.000
THIS IS SOMETHING TARGETED

TO TRY TO CONVINCE CONGRESS NO

03:59.133 --> 04:03.600

04:03.600 --> 04:07.133
>> WE NEVER SET OUT TO SPEND

04:07.133 --> 04:09.833
EIGHT YEARS AT WAR IN IRAQ OR TO

04:09.833 --> 04:12.100
BE MIRED DOWN FOR MORE THAN

04:12.100 --> 04:12.500
DECADE OF FIGHTING I

04:12.500 --> 04:12.767
AFGHANISTAN.

04:12.767 --> 04:13.933
SO WHAT SHOULD AMERICA EXPECT IF

04:13.933 --> 04:14.667
WE RUSH INTO SYRIA, ALONE, WIT

04:14.667 --> 04:15.300
NO REAL PLAN FOR THE

04:15.300 --> 04:15.967
CONSEQUENCES

04:15.967 --> 04:19.967
WE ALREADY KNOW, IT GETS WORSE

04:19.967 --> 04:20.700

SENATOR RAND PAUL PLEDGED HE

04:33.900 --> 04:35.200
AMENDMENT WILL SAY THAT THE VOTE

04:35.200 --> 04:37.300
IS BINDING, THAT THE PRESIDENT

04:37.300 --> 04:40.633
CANNOT IF WE VOTE HIM DOWN

04:40.633 --> 04:42.533
DECIDE TO GO TO WAR ANYWAY

04:42.533 --> 04:45.033
THIS IS NOT CONSTITUTIONAL

04:45.033 --> 04:45.700
THEATER.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.667
>> OF COURSE, THAT WHOLE MEDIA

CAMPAIGN IS ULTIMATELY AIMED A

MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO WILL

05:01.633 --> 05:04.200
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NO

05:05.433 --> 05:06.867
WEEKS TO PLAY OUT AND TH

05:06.867 --> 05:08.333
DECISION IS NOT HAPPENIN

05:08.333 --> 05:08.967
IMMEDIATELY.

05:08.967 --> 05:12.100
>> IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.600
IT DEPENDS ON HOW WELL THE

05:14.600 --> 05:15.933
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS RECEIVE

05:15.933 --> 05:18.567
ON TUESDAY, WHAT SENSE WE GE

COMING TOGETHER ON THIS OR

05:22.067 --> 05:23.467
FALLING APART ON THIS.

TO COME WEDNESDAY WHEN THE

05:27.533 --> 05:28.967
SENATE WILL HAVE A TEST VOTE

05:28.967 --> 05:31.433
IF THE SENATE RUNS OUT THE CLOCK

05:31.433 --> 05:32.933
IT COULD COME AS LATE AS THE

05:32.933 --> 05:34.467
WEEKEND ON NEXT WEEKEND AND TH

HOUSE HAS MADE CLEAR THEY AR

05:37.333 --> 05:39.567
SENATE PROVES THEY CAN PAS

05:39.567 --> 05:39.833
SOMETHING.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.933
IF THAT IS THE CASE IT COULD G

05:41.933 --> 05:43.300
UNTIL THE WEEK AFTER NEXT.

PAUL THAT HE WANTS TO DO

05:52.200 --> 05:53.633
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO STOP IT AND

05:53.633 --> 05:55.633
HE HAS A HISTORY OF FILIBUSTER

05:55.633 --> 05:57.367
>> I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING T

60-VOTE THRESHOLD TO GET PAS

06:03.333 --> 06:03.700
THIS

06:03.700 --> 06:05.967
I THINK HARRY REID HAS BEE

06:05.967 --> 06:07.933
CONFIDENT HE CAN GET THERE I

06:07.933 --> 06:10.767
PART BECAUSE SOME DEMOCRATS,

06:10.767 --> 06:13.100
GOING TO POSE THE RESOLUTION BUT

06:13.100 --> 06:15.100
WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A VOT

06:15.100 --> 06:17.333
TO UPHOLD A FILIBUSTER

06:17.333 --> 06:19.433
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST

06:19.433 --> 06:21.067
IT IN THE END BUT DON'T WANT T

06:21.067 --> 06:24.133
BE OBSTRUCTIONS.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.900
>> IN A RECENT SURVEY BY THE

06:27.900 --> 06:28.533
ASSOCIATED PRESS IT SAID HAL

06:28.533 --> 06:30.800
THE SENATE AND A THIRD OF TH

06:30.800 --> 06:32.600
HOUSE ARE AGAINST IT

06:32.600 --> 06:34.933
>> THE ONE ABSOLUTE WE HAV

06:34.933 --> 06:36.100
HEARD FROM EVERY MEMBER OF

06:36.100 --> 06:37.733
CONGRESS WE TALKED TO IS THA

06:37.733 --> 06:39.367
THEY ARE HEARING FRO

06:39.367 --> 06:40.833
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT IT AND TEN TO

06:40.833 --> 06:41.800
ONE ARE AGAINST IT

06:41.800 --> 06:44.400
I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE ODDS

06:44.400 --> 06:45.500
STACKED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AS

06:45.500 --> 06:47.633
HE TRIES TO MAKE HIS CASE TO

06:47.633 --> 06:48.067
CONGRESS

06:48.067 --> 06:51.967
I CAUTION THAT A LOT OF THE VOTE

06:51.967 --> 06:54.433
COUNTS ARE LEAN NOs AND LEAN

06:54.433 --> 06:55.200
YESs

06:55.200 --> 06:58.600
WE ARE COMING OFF OF A FIVE WEEK

06:58.600 --> 06:58.867
BREAK.

06:58.867 --> 07:01.500
A LOT HAVE NOT BEEN PRIVY TO THE

07:01.500 --> 07:02.467
CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS

07:02.467 --> 07:04.433
WHILE IT IS AN INDICATOR AND

07:04.433 --> 07:06.000
WHILE THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO B

07:06.000 --> 07:07.967
MUCH MOMENTUM MOVING IN TH

07:07.967 --> 07:10.267
FAVOR OF THE PRESIDENT THERE ARE

07:10.267 --> 07:11.133
STILL A LOT OF FACTORS THA

07:11.133 --> 07:13.800
WEIGH IN ON HOW THE VOTE COMES

07:13.800 --> 07:14.133
DOWN

07:14.133 --> 07:15.533
IT SEEMS IN TH

07:15.533 --> 07:16.600
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE IT

07:16.600 --> 07:19.167
IS MUCH MORE OF AN UPHIL

07:19.167 --> 07:19.433
BATTLE

07:19.433 --> 07:22.067
NOT ONLY TO GET REPUBLICANS ON

07:22.067 --> 07:23.333
BOARD BUT TRADITIONALL

07:23.333 --> 07:25.300
PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD TO RELY ON

07:25.300 --> 07:26.767
MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN PARTY

07:26.767 --> 07:28.000
DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE SENATE

07:28.000 --> 07:30.067
THEY HAVE ABOUT 200 VOTES IN THE

07:30.067 --> 07:30.200
HOUSE.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.133
IT SEEMS CLEAR THEY HAVE T

07:32.133 --> 07:33.700
BUILD THE MAJORITY OF TH

07:33.700 --> 07:34.967
SUPPORT IF THE RESOLUTION HA

07:34.967 --> 07:36.833
ANY CHANCE OF PASSING CONGRESS

07:36.833 --> 07:38.467
>> CONSIDERING THERE ARE BOT

07:38.467 --> 07:41.000
EDGES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRU

07:41.000 --> 07:42.067
STACKED AGAINST THE PRESIDEN

07:42.067 --> 07:44.067
HERE, WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO TO

07:44.067 --> 07:45.800
TRY TO REACH BOTH DEMOCRATS AN

07:45.800 --> 07:45.967
REPUBLICANS?

07:45.967 --> 07:47.200
>> ONE THING THAT I THINK THEY

07:47.200 --> 07:49.933
ARE LISTENING TO ON TUESDA

07:49.933 --> 07:52.067
NIGHT ALONG WITH THEIR

07:52.067 --> 07:52.800
CONSTITUENTS IS THE ARGUMENT

07:52.800 --> 07:54.433
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAKES

07:54.433 --> 07:56.000
PARTLY THEY MADE IT AS A

07:56.000 --> 07:56.733
NATIONAL SECURITY ARGUMENT

07:56.733 --> 07:58.467
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEE

07:58.467 --> 08:00.933
THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND COMING

08:00.933 --> 08:03.100
FROM THE PRESIDENT IS TH

08:03.100 --> 08:04.067
HUMANITARIAN ELEMENT TO IT

08:04.067 --> 08:06.867
I THINK IT IS A QUESTION O

08:06.867 --> 08:08.300
MORALITY AND RIGHT AND WRONG

08:08.300 --> 08:10.767
WHETHER WE CAN ALLOW PEOPLE WH

08:10.767 --> 08:12.500
PERPETRATED CHEMICAL ATTACKS AND

08:12.500 --> 08:20.333
KILLED HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN TO

08:20.333 --> 08:21.733
DO SO WITHOUT REPERCUSSIONS.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.200
I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO A

08:23.200 --> 08:24.767
QUESTION OF WHAT IS RIGHT AN

08:24.767 --> 08:25.333
WHAT IS WRONG.

08:25.333 --> 08:29.167
LESS THAN IT IS ANYTHING BACKE

08:29.167 --> 08:30.633
AWAY FROM THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS

08:30.633 --> 08:32.567
IS NOT POTENTIALLY AN IMMEDIAT

08:32.567 --> 08:34.833
THREAT TO THE NATIONAL SECURIT

08:34.833 --> 08:36.033
OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS

08:36.033 --> 08:37.533
LITMUS TEST FOR A LOT OF

08:37.533 --> 08:37.767

08:37.767 --> 08:41.067

08:41.067 --> 08:44.233
EMOTIONAL APPEAL TO THE SENSE OF

08:44.233 --> 08:44.467
HUMANITY

08:44.467 --> 08:45.567

08:48.033 --> 08:52.600

08:52.600 --> 08:53.000

08:53.000 --> 08:58.133
IN AFGHANISTAN

08:58.133 --> 08:58.300
THE TALIBAN SET OFF A CAR BOMB

08:58.300 --> 08:58.667
OUTSIDE AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICE

08:59.167 --> 09:00.100
LAUNCH A SEPARATE ATTACK ON TH

09:00.100 --> 09:00.267

09:00.267 --> 09:00.467
FOUR SOLDIERS AND SIX INSURGENTS

11:01.800 --> 11:02.567
IN THE UPCOMING SESSION WHEN

11:02.567 --> 11:04.400
IT'S NOT DISCUSSING SYRIA?

11:04.400 --> 11:09.700
JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON

11:09.700 --> 11:10.833
FOR THAT IS CHRISTIN

11:10.833 --> 11:11.233

SHE IS THE NEWSHOUR'S POLITICA

11:11.567 --> 11:16.167
EDITOR

11:16.167 --> 11:19.833
THIS WOULD OTHERWISE BE

11:19.833 --> 11:21.100
CONSEQUENTIAL WEEK IN CONGRESS

11:21.100 --> 11:22.300
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:22.300 --> 11:24.767
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS O

11:24.767 --> 11:25.333
CONGRESS'S PLATE

11:25.333 --> 11:26.733
ONE THING WE THOUGHT THE HOUSE

11:26.733 --> 11:28.833
WOULD BE TURNING TO IS

11:28.833 --> 11:29.967
IMMIGRATION REFORM

11:29.967 --> 11:32.033
THE SENATE PASSED BY

11:32.033 --> 11:33.467
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY

11:33.467 --> 11:34.700
COMPREHENSIVE BILL

11:34.700 --> 11:36.500
LAWMAKERS NOT IN FAVOR OF

11:36.500 --> 11:38.733
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ARE

11:38.733 --> 11:40.467
PUTTING PEACE MEAL LEGISLATION

11:40.467 --> 11:42.933
ON THE FLOOR TO ADDRESS THE VISA

11:42.933 --> 11:45.933
SYSTEM AND THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE

11:45.933 --> 11:47.167
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE PACKAGE

11:47.167 --> 11:48.633
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPE

11:48.633 --> 11:50.467
GIVEN WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

11:50.467 --> 11:51.167
SYRIA.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.567
THE OTHER MAJOR PIECE OF THIS IS

11:53.567 --> 11:55.500
SPENDING, THE DEBT, THE DEFICI

11:55.500 --> 11:57.200
AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING ABOU

11:57.200 --> 11:58.200
FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT

11:58.200 --> 12:00.000
>> ONE OF THE FOLKS ON FACEBOO

12:00.000 --> 12:01.600
WAS ASKING ABOUT THE GOVERNMEN

12:01.600 --> 12:02.700
SHUT DOWN.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.733
WHY ISN'T ANYBODY TALKING ABOU

12:04.733 --> 12:04.767
THAT

12:04.767 --> 12:06.633
WE HAVE NINE DAYS OR SO?

12:06.633 --> 12:07.700
>> CONGRESS WILL HAVE NINE

12:07.700 --> 12:08.567
WORKING DAYS

12:08.567 --> 12:10.633
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS COME U

12:10.633 --> 12:12.100
WITH WHAT IS KNOWN AS

12:12.100 --> 12:13.867
CONTINUING RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF

12:13.867 --> 12:15.400
A DIVIDED GOVERNMENT THEY DON'

12:15.400 --> 12:16.833
ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

12:16.833 --> 12:19.833
PASS A REAL BUDGET THAT KEEP

12:19.833 --> 12:21.800
THE GOVERNMENT FUNDED AND LOOK

12:21.800 --> 12:24.233
AT LEVELS OF SPENDING.

12:24.233 --> 12:25.533
INSTEAD THEY HAVE SHORT TERM

12:25.533 --> 12:26.667
RESOLUTIONS IN PLACE FOR ONE

12:26.667 --> 12:26.900
YEAR

12:26.900 --> 12:28.267
THAT HAS BEEN GETTING SHORTE

12:28.267 --> 12:29.200
AND SHORTER.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.100
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME WE HAVE

12:31.100 --> 12:32.233
HAD SUCH A BIG ARGUMENT ABOU

12:32.233 --> 12:33.433
HOW TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT

12:33.433 --> 12:38.300
AND IT EXPIRES ON SEPTEMBER 30

12:38.300 --> 12:40.167
THEN THAT MEANS A PARTIAL OR

12:40.167 --> 12:41.767
FULL GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.467
THE BIG STICKING POINT HERE IS A

12:43.467 --> 12:45.500
LOT OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN TH

12:45.500 --> 12:47.467
SENATE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

12:47.467 --> 12:48.900
PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LA

12:48.900 --> 12:51.467
DEFUNDED, PARTS OF IT THAT WOULD

12:51.467 --> 12:53.200
BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE FALL

12:53.200 --> 12:55.533
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, THEY

12:55.533 --> 12:57.367
CAN TAKE AWAY THE FUNDING FO

12:57.367 --> 12:57.733
THAT

12:57.733 --> 13:00.333
IF THAT ISN'T AGREED TO BY THA

13:00.333 --> 13:01.367
SEPTEMBER 30 DEADLINE IT COULD

13:01.367 --> 13:02.600
BE A REAL FIGHT.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.267
IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE THE

13:04.267 --> 13:05.667
LIMIT FOR WHAT THE GOVERNMEN

13:05.667 --> 13:06.633
CAN SPEND ON ITS DEBT.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.533
AND THAT IS COMING TO PASS VER

13:08.533 --> 13:08.767
SOON

13:08.767 --> 13:11.000
SO THAT IS ALL GETTING LUMPE

13:11.000 --> 13:12.367
INTO ONE BIG ARGUMENT ABOU

13:12.367 --> 13:12.633
SPENDING

13:12.633 --> 13:14.867
>> SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THI

13:14.867 --> 13:16.400
OBAMA CARE PUSH TO TRY TO REPEAL

13:16.400 --> 13:17.100
IT AGAIN

13:17.100 --> 13:19.000
IT HAS BEEN ATTESTED MAN

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
DIFFERENT TIMES.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.700
WHY NOW?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.033
>> WELL, PARTIALLY YOU SEE

13:23.033 --> 13:24.667
GROUPS LIKE THE HERITAGE

13:24.667 --> 13:27.367
FOUNDATION AND OTHER

13:27.367 --> 13:30.267
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS REALLY

13:30.267 --> 13:34.767
CAPITALIZE ON THE POPULARITY

13:34.767 --> 13:38.000
SENATOR TED CRUZ IS ONE OF THEM.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.700
THEY ARE PLANNING A MASSIV

13:39.700 --> 13:40.667
RALLY ON TUESDAY

13:40.667 --> 13:42.300
I SHOULDN'T SAY MASSIVE.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.733
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH SIDE IT IS

13:43.733 --> 13:44.433
GOING TO BE.

13:44.433 --> 13:47.233
THE FOCUS IS MOSTLY ON SYRIA AND

13:47.233 --> 13:48.400
THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS O

13:48.400 --> 13:48.467
TUESDAY.

13:48.467 --> 13:50.233
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE THE

13:50.233 --> 13:51.667
DEFUND OBAMA CARE RALLY IN

13:51.667 --> 13:52.700

13:54.533 --> 13:55.767
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.333
THEY ARE ANGRY THAT THE WHIT

13:57.333 --> 13:59.367
HOUSE DELAYED THE EMPLOYER

13:59.367 --> 14:01.167
MANDATE FOR IMPLEMENTATION O

14:01.167 --> 14:02.067
THE HEALTH CARE LAW.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.967
AND WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO

14:04.967 --> 14:06.700
IS CHOKE IT A LITTLE BIT SO IT

14:06.700 --> 14:09.667
DOESN'T GET FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.433
DEMOCRATS ARE USING THIS AS

14:11.433 --> 14:13.067
CAMPAIGN ISSUE, AS WELL.
