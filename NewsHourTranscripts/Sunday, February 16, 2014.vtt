WHY IS CLIMATE SO HIGH ON TH

05:49.067 --> 05:50.767
STATE DEPARTMENT'S AGENDA RIGH

05:50.767 --> 05:51.100
NOW?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.867
>> I THINK THERE ARE REALLY TW

05:52.867 --> 05:53.967
REASONS FOR THAT

05:53.967 --> 05:54.633
ONE IS THAT SECRETARY OF STATE

05:54.633 --> 05:57.900
IS TRYING TO BUILD MOMENTU

05:57.900 --> 05:59.300
TOWARD THE CONFERENCE NEXT YEAR,

05:59.300 --> 06:00.933
BIG PERSONAL PRIORITY OF HIS A

06:00.933 --> 06:01.100
WELL

06:01.100 --> 06:03.067
AND THEN THE OTHER REASON, I

06:03.067 --> 06:04.267
THINK, IS THAT THE U.S

06:04.267 --> 06:05.800
GOVERNMENT SEES CLIMATE CHANGE

06:05.800 --> 06:07.033
AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AS ON

06:07.033 --> 06:11.533
OF THE AREAS IN WHICH YOU CA

06:11.533 --> 06:11.600
POTENTIALLY COOPERATE WITH

06:11.600 --> 06:13.367
CHINA, HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WIT

06:13.367 --> 06:15.100
CHINA AND COMPETITIVE ASPECT

06:15.100 --> 06:17.200
WHICH ARE GATHERING STEAM.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.233
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE

06:18.233 --> 06:20.667
AREAS WHERE THEY MAY BE ABLE T

06:20.667 --> 06:22.733
WORK TOGETHER IN A MUCH MORE

06:22.733 --> 06:23.167
COHERENT AREA.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.333
>> AND ONE OF THE AREAS THE U.S.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.700
WANTS TO WORK WITH CHINA I

06:26.700 --> 06:29.600
NORTH KOREA.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.867
IS NORTH KOREA'S -- I SHOULD SAY

06:31.867 --> 06:34.000
IS CHINA'S INFLUENCE ON NORT

06:34.000 --> 06:36.733
KOREA DIMINISHING WITH THE

06:36.733 --> 06:38.267
TUMULT THAT'S HAPPENING THERE?

06:38.267 --> 06:43.300
>> CHINA IS STILL VERY MUCH TH

06:43.300 --> 06:45.233
GUARANTOR, WHICH THE REGIM

06:45.233 --> 06:46.100
RELIES ON.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.967
WHEN KIM JONG-UN HAD HIS UNCLE

06:49.967 --> 06:53.367
EXECUTED ESSENTIALLY, HE WAS A

06:53.367 --> 06:55.733
VERY CLOSE -- THE PERSON IN TH

06:55.733 --> 06:56.967
REGIME THAT THE CHINESE HAD TH

06:56.967 --> 06:58.067
CLOSEST TIES TO.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.300
THEY SAW HIM AS SOMEONE THEY

06:59.300 --> 07:01.100
COULD DEAL WITH MORE

07:01.100 --> 07:01.233
EFFECTIVELY.

07:01.233 --> 07:04.367
THEY'RE HOPING THAT HE WOULD

07:04.367 --> 07:06.133
ENCOURAGE MORE CHINESE ECONOMI

07:06.133 --> 07:07.567
REFORMS IN NORTH KOREA AND S

07:07.567 --> 07:09.467
NOW THAT HE'S OUT OF THE

07:09.467 --> 07:11.767
PICTURE, THEY FEEL POTENTIALLY

07:11.767 --> 07:12.833
MUCH LESS INFLUENCE OVER THE

07:12.833 --> 07:13.200
REGIME

07:13.200 --> 07:15.467
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE O

07:15.467 --> 07:18.267
MONTHS AGO WE HEARD THE SABE

07:18.267 --> 07:19.800
RATTLING FROM CHINA AND JAPA

07:19.800 --> 07:21.267
ABOUT THESE DISPUTED ISLANDS

07:21.267 --> 07:24.267
IS THAT GETTING ANY BETTER

07:24.267 --> 07:26.900
>> STILL VERY MUCH A HOT ISSUE

07:26.900 --> 07:28.233
THERE ARE ENGAGEMENTS ALMOST O

07:28.233 --> 07:33.467
A DAILY BASIS BETWEEN JAPANESE

07:33.467 --> 07:35.133
SHIPS, CHINESE AIRCRAFT AND TH

07:35.133 --> 07:37.500
RISK IS NOT THAT THE CHINESE ARE

07:37.500 --> 07:39.333
GOING TO INVADE THE ISLANDS OR

07:39.333 --> 07:40.900
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT THE RISK

07:40.900 --> 07:42.733
IS SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT

07:42.733 --> 07:43.667
MISCALCULATION, ONE OF THESE

07:43.667 --> 07:45.167
PILOTS GOES A LITTLE TOO FAR

07:45.167 --> 07:46.700
AND YOU CAN GET SORT OF TH

07:46.700 --> 07:47.967
INCIDENT THAT QUICKLY SPINS OU

07:47.967 --> 07:48.800
OF CONTROL

07:48.800 --> 07:49.700
>> ALL RIGHT

07:49.700 --> 07:52.333
AND FINALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG

07:52.333 --> 07:52.867
PICTURE.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.100
WHERE IS THE U.S. STATUS I

07:58.833 --> 08:03.367
ASIAN COUNTRIES IN APRIL

08:03.367 --> 08:04.067
>> ABSOLUTELY.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.633
IN A VERY STRONG POSITION IN

08:05.633 --> 08:05.733
ASIA

08:05.733 --> 08:07.167
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS

08:07.167 --> 08:08.167
THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRIES I

08:08.167 --> 08:09.867
THE REGION, APART FROM CHINA

08:09.867 --> 08:12.067
WANT TO SEE A SIMILAR START OF

FIRST OF ALL, HOW BIGATIVE

18:33.800 --> 18:34.667
PROBLEM IS IT?

18:34.667 --> 18:36.867
HOW WIDESPREAD ARE THESE

18:36.867 --> 18:37.033
SHORTAGES?

18:37.033 --> 18:39.033
>> IT'S ACTUALLY A FAIRL

18:39.033 --> 18:39.600
SERIOUS PROBLEM.

THE NUMBER OF SHORTAGES SINC

OF SHORTAGES SINCE 2007 HAVE

18:46.967 --> 18:47.400
TRIPLED.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.967
SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ANYTHING

18:49.967 --> 18:53.233
FROM INJECTABLE CANCER DRUGS T

18:53.233 --> 18:59.667

19:09.133 --> 19:11.167
>> IT MIGHT BE STRANGE BUT IT'

19:11.167 --> 19:13.033
OFTEN A MYSTERY WHEN A DRUG GOES

19:13.033 --> 19:14.500
INTO SHORTAGE AS TO WHY.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.600
YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A

19:16.600 --> 19:17.933
STRAIGHT, SIMPLE, PLAIN ANSWER

19:17.933 --> 19:19.500
BUT IN MANY CASES THERE'S NOT.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.433
THE PRODUCERS THEMSELVES ARE A

19:21.433 --> 19:22.333
LITTLE SECRETIVE

19:22.333 --> 19:24.233
THEY SAY IT'S A TRADE SECRET T

19:24.233 --> 19:26.500
TELL THE WORLD EXACTLY WHAT IS

19:26.500 --> 19:28.233
HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING THE

19:28.233 --> 19:31.400
SHORTAGE, SO THEY DON'T NEED T

19:31.400 --> 19:32.433
DETAIL THE REASON.

19:32.433 --> 19:36.033
OFTEN TIMES, HOWEVER, IT'S THA

19:36.033 --> 19:37.667
MANY -- THERE ARE VERY FEW

19:37.667 --> 19:40.333
PRODUCERS OF STEROL INJECTABLE

19:40.333 --> 19:41.967
DRUGS, THE DRUGS THAT ARE MOST

19:41.967 --> 19:43.467
OFTEN IN SHORTAGE IN THE UNITE

19:43.467 --> 19:44.000
STATES

19:44.000 --> 19:46.933
TWO, THREE, FOUR PRODUCERS ONLY.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.333
MANY OF THE PRODUCTION LINES

19:48.333 --> 19:50.467
THAT THEY HAVE ARE QUITE OLD

19:50.467 --> 19:52.167
SO, KIND OF LIKE AN OLD CA

19:52.167 --> 19:54.933
NEEDS A LOT OF REPAIRS, MORE

19:54.933 --> 19:57.467
KIND OF FOCUS IN ATTENTION

19:57.467 --> 20:00.233
SAME THING WITH THESE PLANTS

20:00.233 --> 20:01.967
WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG, THE

20:01.967 --> 20:04.267
FDA STEPS IN AND SAYS, WELL, W

20:04.267 --> 20:05.667
CAN'T PRODUCE THIS LINE IF

20:05.667 --> 20:07.067
THERE'S SOMETHING -- THERE'S

20:07.067 --> 20:09.100
CONTAMINATION IN THE DRUG.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.733
INSTEAD WHAT HAPPENS IS THE LINE

20:10.733 --> 20:12.333
IS SHUT DOWN, SOMETIMES AN

20:12.333 --> 20:14.233
ENTIRE FACTORY AND A DRUG GOES

20:14.233 --> 20:15.700
INTO SHORTAGE BECAUSE THE FE

20:15.700 --> 20:17.567
NUMBER OF OTHER PRODUCERS SIMPLY

20:17.567 --> 20:19.533
AREN'T IN A POSITION TO RAMP U

20:19.533 --> 20:20.533
PRODUCTION QUICKLY ENOUGH TO

20:20.533 --> 20:21.533
KEEP UP.

20:21.533 --> 20:24.400
>> SO, ARE THERE ECONOMI

20:24.400 --> 20:26.600
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS?

20:26.600 --> 20:27.233
>> YES

20:27.233 --> 20:29.133
VERY INTERESTINGLY, THERE WERE

20:29.133 --> 20:31.733
ECONOMIC FACTORS

20:31.733 --> 20:34.933
STEROL INJECTABLE DRUGS ARE VERY

20:34.933 --> 20:35.900
SMALL PROFIT MARGIN.

20:35.900 --> 20:39.000
SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS, YOU

20:39.000 --> 20:42.233
KNOW, A LINE GOES DOWN

20:42.233 --> 20:43.267
SOMETHING BREAKS

20:43.267 --> 20:44.667
SOMETHING BREAKS DOWN.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.867
AND A COMPANY, A PRODUCER LOOK

20:46.867 --> 20:48.833
AT THE MARGINS AND LOOKS AT TH

20:48.833 --> 20:50.133
ECONOMICS AND SAYS, WELL, YO

20:50.133 --> 20:51.567
KNOW, IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH WITH

20:51.567 --> 20:54.200
THE MARGINS WE'RE GETTING ON

20:54.200 --> 20:55.667
THIS DRUG CONTINUING THE LINE,

20:55.667 --> 20:58.100
PUTTING THE MONEY IN TO FIX IT

20:58.100 --> 21:00.500
SO, IN FACT, THEY LET IT GO INTO

21:00.500 --> 21:02.467
SHORTAGE AND EVEN IF PEOPLE NEED

21:02.467 --> 21:04.267
IT, EVEN IF IT'S A CRITICA

21:04.267 --> 21:07.600
DRUG -- SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, TH

21:07.600 --> 21:09.000
NITROGLYCERIN IN HEART

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
SURGERIES, THEY DON'T PRODUCE

21:10.000 --> 21:12.433
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE FDA

21:12.433 --> 21:15.467
CAN ENCOURAGE, YOU KNOW,

21:15.467 --> 21:17.333
PRODUCERS TO DO -- TO KEEP

21:17.333 --> 21:18.233
GOING, BUT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

21:18.233 --> 21:19.667
THE POWER TO FORCE THEM TO D

21:19.667 --> 21:20.100
THAT

21:20.100 --> 21:22.533
>> SO, WHAT ARE TH

21:22.533 --> 21:24.033
RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE GAO O

21:24.033 --> 21:25.733
WHAT THE FDA SHOULD BE DOING

21:25.733 --> 21:27.767
>> SO WHAT THE GAO SAI

21:27.767 --> 21:30.167
ESSENTIALLY IS THAT THE FD

21:30.167 --> 21:31.767
NEEDED TO BE ESSENTIALLY MOR

21:31.767 --> 21:34.067
NIMBLE IN HOW IT WAS PREDICTIN

21:34.067 --> 21:35.733
THESE SHORTAGES.

21:35.733 --> 21:37.833
IT HAS NOW TREMENDOUS DATABASE

21:37.833 --> 21:41.367
OF NUMBERS THAT TELL IT WHAT I

21:41.367 --> 21:43.233
IN SHORTAGE AND HOW LONG IT'

21:43.233 --> 21:44.267
BEEN IN SHORTAGE

21:44.267 --> 21:46.100
A FAIR AMOUNT OF DATA, BUT

21:46.100 --> 21:48.233
BASICALLY THE GAO SAID THE FDA

21:48.233 --> 21:49.600
WASN'T USING THAT DATA TO KIND

21:49.600 --> 21:51.500
OF LOOK AT OVERALL PATTERNS IN

21:51.500 --> 21:53.867
THE COUNTRY, LOOK AT KIND OF HOW

21:53.867 --> 21:56.467
THESE THINGS TENDED TO SHAKE OUT

21:56.467 --> 21:58.600
AND THEN TRY TO PREDICT WHEN THE

21:58.600 --> 21:59.333
SHORTAGES WOULD OCCUR.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.367
THAT'S WHAT THE GAO TOLD THE FDA

22:01.367 --> 22:03.367
THEY NEEDED TO GET BETTER AT

22:03.367 --> 22:08.000
>> SABRINA TAVERNISI FROM "THE
