JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.233 --> 00:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Fallout from Donald
Trump Jr.'s meeting with
a Russian government

00:10.966 --> 00:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer rocks the White House
-- a look at whether there
were legal violations involved,

00:17.366 --> 00:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the effects of it all
on the administration.

00:19.366 --> 00:21.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:21.433 --> 00:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI Director
Nominee: My loyalty is to
the Constitution, to the rule

00:24.800 --> 00:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of law, and to the
mission of the FBI.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President
Trump's pick to head the
FBI, Christopher Wray,
faces Senate questioning,

00:33.033 --> 00:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much of it around the firing
of former Director James Comey.

00:37.066 --> 00:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a massive piece of
Antarctica finally breaks
off, releasing one of
the largest icebergs

00:44.066 --> 00:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in recorded history, and
dramatically changing the
landscape of the peninsula.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we continue our series
Inside Putin's Russia with a
trip to the country's southern

00:55.500 --> 00:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border, where ISIS
propaganda has taken hold.

00:57.866 --> 01:02.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There's
been a local insurgency
here in the capital of
Dagestan, Makhachkala,

01:04.833 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for years, targeting both
local authorities and symbols
of the national government.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:14.666 --> 01:17.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.500 --> 01:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is heading back to Europe
tonight, this time to France,

01:26.866 --> 01:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for its independence, or
Bastille Day, celebrations.

01:30.433 --> 01:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he leaves behind a swirl
over his son's efforts to get
damaging information about

01:36.900 --> 01:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, provided
by the Russian government.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:41.533 --> 01:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Across Capitol Hill,
the big question was what the
bombshell revelations in Donald

01:47.533 --> 01:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump Jr.'s e-mails do to
the Russia investigation.

01:51.133 --> 01:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At his weekly news conference,
House Speaker Paul Ryan did
his best to avoid commenting

01:56.766 --> 01:57.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
directly.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:59.566 --> 02:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We have a special counsel
that's doing an investigation

02:00.633 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over at the Justice Department.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have an investigation
here in the House.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have an investigation
in the Senate.

02:06.833 --> 02:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very important
that these professionals
in these committees
do their jobs, so that

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we can get to the
bottom of all this.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Mike Conaway, the
Texas Republican leading the
House investigation, didn't say

02:18.200 --> 02:20.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much either.

02:20.233 --> 02:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have any concerns about
what you're seeing now, the
press reports about these

02:25.366 --> 02:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meetings that he took
with the Russian lawyer?

02:25.900 --> 02:27.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:27.933 --> 02:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CONAWAY (R), Texas: Yes,
we're going to pursue every
lead that needs to pursue

02:29.200 --> 02:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and every clue that
needs to be pursued.

02:30.400 --> 02:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Does this
lead need to be pursued?

02:30.933 --> 02:33.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE CONAWAY: We're going
to pursue every lead that
makes sense to pursue.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In an interview to
be broadcast tomorrow on CBN,
President Trump said Russian

02:37.100 --> 02:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin
wouldn't have wanted to
help him in the first place.

02:39.166 --> 02:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: If Hillary
had won, our military would be

02:39.833 --> 02:41.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decimated.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our energy would be
much more expensive.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what Putin doesn't
like about me, and that's why
I say, why would he want me?

02:45.266 --> 02:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Last night,
Donald Trump Jr. offered
his first public defense
to FOX News Channel's

02:45.933 --> 02:47.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sean Hannity.

02:47.933 --> 02:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of
Donald Trump: In retrospect, I
probably would have done things

02:48.766 --> 02:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little differently.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Again, this was
before Russia mania.

02:51.533 --> 02:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was before they were
building it up in the press.

02:52.766 --> 02:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For me, this was
opposition research.

02:55.366 --> 02:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning,
Mr. Trump gave his eldest
son a rave review: "He
was open, transparent

02:56.066 --> 02:57.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and innocent.

02:57.466 --> 02:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the greatest witch-hunt
in political history."

02:59.533 --> 03:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At his confirmation hearing to
be FBI director, Christopher
Wray was pressed on that point.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had a different view of
the investigations, including
special counsel Robert Mueller's

03:09.533 --> 03:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
probe, than the man
who nominated him.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: I'm asking
you, as the future FBI
director, do you consider

03:15.366 --> 03:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this endeavor a witch-hunt?

03:17.366 --> 03:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI Director
Nominee: I do not consider
Director Mueller to be on

03:19.233 --> 03:21.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a witch-hunt.

03:21.233 --> 03:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, the
president's legal team tried to
distance their client from his

03:24.366 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
namesake.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SEKULOW, Attorney For Donald
Trump: The president wasn't
aware of the meeting, didn't

03:28.400 --> 03:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
participate in the meeting,
didn't attend the meeting and
was only made aware of the

03:34.300 --> 03:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails -- actually, reading
the e-mails, seeing the
e-mails, was yesterday when they

03:36.233 --> 03:38.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were released.

03:38.266 --> 03:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For Mr. Trump, the
Russia story has become a burden
he cannot escape, no matter

03:41.200 --> 03:43.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how hard he tries.

03:43.266 --> 03:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every time he appears to be
moving in a different direction,
another disclosure puts it right

03:48.100 --> 03:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back front and center.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov
seemed to sympathize.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator):
Today, I turned on the TV again,

03:57.366 --> 04:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and all the Western channels
are discussing only this.

04:00.266 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is amazing how serious
people can make a mountain
when there might not even be a

04:05.033 --> 04:07.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
molehill.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There's sure to be
more discussion next week, when
the Senate Judiciary Committee

04:10.733 --> 04:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants former Trump campaign
chairman Paul Manafort to
testify about his role.

04:16.766 --> 04:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

04:19.266 --> 04:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the
president told Reuters
that he only learned
of Donald Trump Jr.'s

04:23.700 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meeting with a Russian
lawyer a few days ago.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said -- quote --
"I think many people would
have held that meeting."

04:30.133 --> 04:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also said that he
asked Russian President
Putin last week if he
had meddled in the U.S.

04:36.566 --> 04:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, and Putin that
said twice absolutely not.

04:39.366 --> 04:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore the legal
implications of all this
after the news summary.

04:44.133 --> 04:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: Federal
Reserve Board Chair Janet
Yellen affirmed that short-term

04:49.000 --> 04:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest rates are likely to
rise again in the coming months.

04:53.466 --> 04:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she also left the door
open to changing those plans.

04:57.366 --> 05:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yellen told a congressional
hearing that a recent slowdown
in inflation might make the

05:02.233 --> 05:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Central Bank recalculate.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: Monetary policy is
not on a preset course.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're watching this
very closely, and stand
ready to adjust our
policy if it appears that

05:15.866 --> 05:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the inflation undershoot
will be persistent.

05:18.633 --> 05:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately,
Yellen said the Fed could begin
to unload its massive bond

05:24.366 --> 05:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
holdings this year.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It bought government bonds
during and after the recession
in order to lower long-term

05:30.433 --> 05:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interest rates and to
boost economic activity.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street took heart
from Yellen's talk of
going slow on rate hikes.

05:38.166 --> 05:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained 123
points to close at 21532.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a new record.

05:46.233 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose nearly
68 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 17.

05:53.300 --> 05:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of Brazil's former
presidents, Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva, was convicted
today in a sweeping

05:58.533 --> 06:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
corruption probe.

06:01.166 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A judge sentenced him
to 9.5 years in prison,
but for now he remains
free, pending his appeal.

06:06.966 --> 06:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Silva served as president from
2003 to 2010, and is still
widely admired in Brazil.

06:14.333 --> 06:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Saudi Arabia today, U.S.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
held talks, but made no apparent

06:21.200 --> 06:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
progress in ending a
boycott of another Persian
Gulf nation, Qatar.

06:26.866 --> 06:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson met with King Salman,
and later the Saudi crown
prince, in the city of Jiddah.

06:31.366 --> 06:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Later, he flew to Kuwait, and
returns to Qatar tomorrow.

06:34.833 --> 06:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Saudis and other Arab
states have accused Qatar
of financing terrorism.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Turkey, President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan has rejected
any talk of lifting a state of

06:45.900 --> 06:47.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emergency.

06:47.933 --> 06:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He imposed it last July
after rogue soldiers
tried to overthrow the
government, killing

06:52.766 --> 06:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more than 240 people.

06:54.833 --> 06:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan visited graves of the
victims yesterday, and he told
international investors meeting

07:00.966 --> 07:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Ankara today that disloyal
elements are still at large.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through translator):
What are we supposed to do with

07:06.500 --> 07:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all this happening?

07:07.733 --> 07:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They say lift the
state of emergency.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This won't happen.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I had an interview
with an international
media organization.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They asked if the state
of emergency will finish.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It will finish when this
business is completely
out of the way.

There is word that Chinese
political dissident and Nobel
peace laureate Liu Xiaobo is now

07:31.433 --> 07:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in critical condition.

07:33.366 --> 07:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A hospital in Shenyang,
reported today he is suffering
multiple organ failure.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Liu has late-stage liver cancer.

07:41.366 --> 07:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was released from prison on
medical leave just last month.

07:48.433 --> 07:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the Royal
Bank of Scotland has agreed on a
settlement with U.S. regulators,

07:52.433 --> 07:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and will pay $5.5 billion.

07:55.333 --> 08:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It involves claims that the
bank sold billions of dollars of
toxic mortgage-backed securities

08:01.500 --> 08:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the 2008
financial meltdown.

08:04.733 --> 08:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And President Trump lost
his nominee today to

James Clinger cited

08:17.166 --> 08:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said that they have grown
more challenging in the interim.

08:21.033 --> 08:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the legal questions surrounding
Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting

08:25.166 --> 08:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a Russian lawyer; President
Trump's pick for FBI director
faces the Senate; an iceberg

08:32.400 --> 08:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the size of Delaware breaks off
from Antarctica; and much more.

08:46.966 --> 08:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now back to the controversies
swirling around Donald Trump Jr.
and the president's top campaign

08:52.433 --> 08:54.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aides.

08:54.566 --> 08:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The e-mail exchange published
by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday
reignited a legal debate about

09:00.166 --> 09:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
whether members of the
Trump campaign engaged
in unlawful activity.

09:04.066 --> 09:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We get two perspectives
now, from Bob Bauer.

09:07.266 --> 09:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He served as White House
counsel to President
Obama from 2009 to 2011.

09:11.400 --> 09:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now a lawyer in private
practice in Washington.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Jed Shugerman, He's
a professor at Fordham
University Law School.

09:21.066 --> 09:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, we thank you
both for being with us.

09:23.666 --> 09:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bob Bauer, to you first.

09:25.766 --> 09:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the president's son was
told that the Russian government
had incriminating information

09:31.333 --> 09:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Hillary Clinton that it
wanted to share with him.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did he break a law
by pursuing that?

09:36.533 --> 09:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB BAUER, Former White
House Counsel: In my view,
we have some evidence.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have all the evidence.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would suspect the
congressional investigating
committee and the special
counsel will continue

09:48.933 --> 09:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to dig into questions raised
by the facts disclosed by The
New York Times and by Donald

09:53.266 --> 09:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump Jr. himself.

09:55.233 --> 09:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is highly suggestive
of a potential violation
of the law on two counts.

09:59.166 --> 10:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number one, it demonstrates
that the campaign as a whole
had the intent to court support,

10:06.100 --> 10:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
receive support, solicit
support from a foreign national
source, in this case, the Russia

10:10.366 --> 10:12.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

10:12.366 --> 10:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, in my view, the
meeting itself could constitute
illegal solicitation of support

10:17.766 --> 10:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from a foreign national
under campaign finance law.

10:19.833 --> 10:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it both has broad legal
significance, and on that one
specific issue of liability,

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has a more concrete
significance.

10:26.400 --> 10:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
tying it to campaign
finance, is that right?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BOB BAUER: Yes.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm talking here about a statute
that has been on the books
for many years that Congress

10:36.266 --> 10:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tightened in 2002 that prohibits
receiving and soliciting
contributions from a foreign

10:44.000 --> 10:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national or providing
the foreign national with
substantial assistance
in trying to influence

10:48.433 --> 10:50.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a U.S. election.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jed Shugerman,
listening to this, and I
know you have been looking at

10:53.800 --> 10:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the laws with regard to this
today, does this sound like
something that fits under that

10:59.566 --> 11:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
legal definition?

11:01.700 --> 11:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JED SHUGERMAN, Fordham
University Law School:
Yes, I have been looking
at this quite a bit

11:02.900 --> 11:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and I have been
reading Bob's work.

11:04.366 --> 11:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Bob is -- generally, he's
a terrific expert on this.

11:06.933 --> 11:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think I disagree with
him and how far to apply
campaign finance law.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm very sympathetic to
his perspective here.

11:14.700 --> 11:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I think we're
getting into some dangerous
territory with applying
federal election law

11:20.566 --> 11:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too broadly at this stage.

11:22.633 --> 11:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
News keeps breaking every day,
so I'm just saying, what we
know now, to argue that this

11:26.233 --> 11:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meeting itself is a violation
of the campaign finance law
raises a couple of questions.

11:33.233 --> 11:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
First of all, it raises
the danger of applying
and criminalizing
contacts between anyone

11:39.733 --> 11:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a campaign with
a foreign national.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me give you a hypothetical.

11:44.066 --> 11:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagine if there was a Web site
that published what purported
to be the birth certificate

11:50.466 --> 11:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of President Obama from Kenya,
and an Obama staffer went
and met with Kenyan nationals

11:56.266 --> 12:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find out about the
veracity of that document.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Under this interpretation,
that would still be a thing of
value, but would we criminalize

12:05.133 --> 12:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama campaign for checking?

12:07.400 --> 12:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, similarly, would we say
of the Romney campaign, you
can't do opposition research

12:12.366 --> 12:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by investigating?

12:13.366 --> 12:14.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:14.366 --> 12:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JED SHUGERMAN: Yes, go ahead.

12:16.366 --> 12:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just
going to say, let me just
stop you there on that point.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about that, Bob Bauer,
that there's a danger here
in making this cover any kind

12:23.933 --> 12:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of information that is
shared with a campaign
by a foreign entity?

12:26.400 --> 12:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOB BAUER: Well, that's
not the case at all here.

12:29.766 --> 12:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not talking about a
casual conversation with some
information that the campaign is

12:36.400 --> 12:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
looking for it sort
of acquires by talking
to a foreign national.

12:39.100 --> 12:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're talking about an
operational link between
a foreign government
and a campaign, one in

12:46.100 --> 12:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the foreign government is
stating its intention to provide
ongoing support, dispatches

12:49.066 --> 12:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of its emissaries, if we're
to understand the facts as
so far presented in the news,

12:55.566 --> 12:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dispatches one of its emissaries
from Moscow to Washington, D.C.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on top of all that, not
only does the campaign indicate
that it's anxious for the

13:02.766 --> 13:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help, but, as you recall,
Donald Trump Jr. even suggests
in one of his e-mails that he

13:07.166 --> 13:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would like to discuss timing,
that if the information is as
good as advertised, he would

13:10.933 --> 13:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like to see it released
later in the summer.

13:13.166 --> 13:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The campaign finance
laws clearly distinguish
between the kind of
speech that I think that

13:20.233 --> 13:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Professor Shugerman is
legitimately concerned
about from this kind of
operational relationship

13:25.566 --> 13:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a strong supporter
for a campaign engaged
in very specific
activities on its behalf.

13:27.733 --> 13:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jed Shugerman,
it is the case that the e-mail
to Donald Trump Jr. said the

13:34.600 --> 13:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russian government wants
to help your campaign.

13:37.700 --> 13:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JED SHUGERMAN: All of this is
indicative or suggestive of
what we might find out later.

13:44.666 --> 13:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think if we carefully read
the e-mails, I think it's hard
to make the leap that this

13:48.766 --> 13:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is like a coordination.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's indications there.

13:51.666 --> 13:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I understand where Bob
Bauer is coming from.

13:53.866 --> 13:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we have to be
careful, though, because if you
read the e-mail from a little

13:58.266 --> 14:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit of perspective of how could
this be applied in the future
and can we have line-drawing

14:02.933 --> 14:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, it's hard to see where
this e-mail doesn't lead to some
effect of applying this to any

14:09.400 --> 14:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of contact
between a government...

14:11.433 --> 14:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me
now ask both of you.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I will come to you,
Jed Shugerman first.

14:15.433 --> 14:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The word collusion, colluding
has been thrown around a lot in
the last few weeks about whether

14:21.633 --> 14:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump campaign was colluding
with Russian officials.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is there some legal
connection there?

14:28.066 --> 14:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that an issue?

14:30.100 --> 14:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JED SHUGERMAN: Well,
the word collusion is
more of a political
word than a legal word.

14:32.933 --> 14:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no statute
against collusion.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And -- but I think the
word we might turn to in
the law is conspiracy.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is where we're headed.

14:40.766 --> 14:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is a lot of other
information that is coming
out day by day that points

14:45.566 --> 14:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this conspiracy.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we may have conspiracy.

14:49.333 --> 14:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what we're getting
closer towards is a violation
of 1986 law of computer hacking,

14:55.633 --> 14:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I think, if you look
at the timing, there are just
too many coincidences about

14:58.100 --> 15:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the Trump campaign was
doing before and after this June
3 e-mail about President Trump

15:02.633 --> 15:04.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

15:04.633 --> 15:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just -- my point here is,
I think we need to be careful
in analyzing each step.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JED SHUGERMAN: I think there is
evidence that's pointing towards
crimes, but I think we need

15:13.200 --> 15:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to be careful when we
make interpretations
of these statutes.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
we certainly want
to be careful here.

15:18.433 --> 15:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know we're speculating,
but we do think it's important
to ask these questions.

15:23.266 --> 15:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bob Bauer, just quickly on
the conspiracy question?

15:26.066 --> 15:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BOB BAUER: Well, I think
there is a basis here.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't disagree
with Professor Shugerman.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is going to be an
ongoing investigation.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not the only evidence
that will be taken into account.

15:36.466 --> 15:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And certainly, if, in fact,
there is apparently a violation
of the campaign finance laws,

15:43.433 --> 15:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the evidence is beginning
to point in that direction,
then, yes, the prosecutors

15:46.500 --> 15:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could certainly develop a
conspiracy charge or an aiding
and abetting charge based on

15:50.933 --> 15:53.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

15:53.066 --> 15:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I could just add one more
point, this is not a statute
that is subject to the same

15:56.766 --> 16:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free speech considerations that
Professor Shugerman outlines
that apply in the domestic

16:01.300 --> 16:03.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. context.

16:03.366 --> 16:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, for example, it was
very clear from the testimony
of FBI director nominee Chris

16:09.233 --> 16:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wray, who was asked about this,
that, in his view, this sort
of communication between the

16:12.100 --> 16:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian government
and a campaign is a
national security matter.

16:15.866 --> 16:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he said any meeting
like that shouldn't have
been taken unless the
campaign had consulted

16:20.266 --> 16:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with what he called
its legal advisers.

16:22.500 --> 16:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think it was clear
from the FBI director's
remarks here this is a
national security issue,

16:29.333 --> 16:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the free speech considerations
are different, and the
implications are legal.

16:31.433 --> 16:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
gentlemen, we are going
to have to leave it there.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bob Bauer, Jed Shugerman,
we thank you both.

16:36.633 --> 16:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOB BAUER: Thanks for having us.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JED SHUGERMAN:
Thank you very much.

16:41.766 --> 16:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we noted
earlier, the issue of Russian
meddling figured into the Senate

16:52.300 --> 16:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmation hearing today for
Christopher Wray, the nominee
to be the next FBI director.

16:58.466 --> 17:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it was not the
only topic of note.

17:00.900 --> 17:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senators were also trying to
get a sense for whether Wray
was the right person to lead

17:04.600 --> 17:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bureau through the
political crosswinds of the day.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
takes it from there.

17:10.366 --> 17:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He's worked 25
years as both as a top federal
a prosecutor and as defense

17:16.766 --> 17:17.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attorney.

17:17.766 --> 17:19.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:19.866 --> 17:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa: Do
you affirm that the testimony
you're about to give before

17:21.866 --> 17:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the committee will be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you,

17:27.066 --> 17:28.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
God?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI
Director Nominee: I do.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Christopher
Wray faced few questions about
his experience, and instead

17:32.300 --> 17:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long list of them about
his independence as a
potential FBI chief.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont: If
the president asked you to do
something unlawful or unethical,

17:39.733 --> 17:41.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what do you say?

17:41.233 --> 17:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: First, I
would try to talk him out of it.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And if that failed,
I would resign.

17:46.233 --> 17:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was one of
many references to the last FBI
director, James Comey, fired

17:51.966 --> 17:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by President Trump.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comey claimed the president
asked him to let go of
investigating former
aide Michael Flynn,

17:59.166 --> 18:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and demanded a loyalty oath.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The White House
disputes all of that.

18:02.766 --> 18:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Wray, as the FBI nominee,
was asked about his allegiance.

18:06.700 --> 18:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: My loyalty is
to the Constitution, to the rule
of law, and to the mission of

18:12.233 --> 18:14.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the FBI.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no one asked me for any
kind of loyalty oath at any
point during this process, and

18:17.600 --> 18:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I sure as heck didn't offer one.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And
about his conviction.

18:21.066 --> 18:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: I believe
to my core that there's only
one right way to do this job,

18:28.066 --> 18:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is with
strict independence,
by the book, playing it
straight, faithful to the

18:33.766 --> 18:35.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Constitution.

18:35.833 --> 18:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Wray spoke
about his 2004 pledge to leave
the Justice Department over

18:39.366 --> 18:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bush administration's use
of warrantless wiretaps, which
he believed were illegal.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was following the lead of
Comey, then the deputy attorney
general, and Robert Mueller,

18:51.466 --> 18:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the FBI director, and
now the man in charge of the
special Russia investigation.

18:56.866 --> 19:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: I view him as
the consummate straight-shooter,
and somebody I have enormous

19:00.300 --> 19:02.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
respect for.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would be pleased to
do what I can to support
him in his mission.

19:05.433 --> 19:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Wray also
worked on counterterrorism
at the Justice Department,
and was asked today

19:11.033 --> 19:12.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about torture.

19:12.566 --> 19:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: My view
is that torture is wrong.

19:14.633 --> 19:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unacceptable, it's illegal,
and I think it's ineffective.

19:17.533 --> 19:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And
about protecting Muslim
Americans from backlash.

19:21.066 --> 19:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY: I think
the FBI director and the FBI
needs to be -- the FBI and the

19:25.533 --> 19:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FBI director for all Americans,
including Muslim Americans.

19:29.866 --> 19:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my experience in terrorism
investigations has been that
some of the best leads we ever

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got were from members
of that community.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He stressed
the need to fight terrorism,
including cyber-terrorism, and

19:45.866 --> 19:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protect classified information.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the end, senators of
both parties seemed assured.

19:50.033 --> 19:52.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota:
Looking around, I'm feeling
that you have had a good hearing

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And best of luck to you, sir.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER WRAY:
Thank you, Senator.

19:58.133 --> 20:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That means a lot.

20:00.233 --> 20:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: If approved,
Wray would be the eighth FBI
director confirmed by the U.S.

20:05.633 --> 20:06.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

20:06.833 --> 20:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

20:12.500 --> 20:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:21.366 --> 20:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
why so many Russians from
that country's southern
region are joining

20:28.333 --> 20:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS; a view from both sides
of the political aisle on the
Russia controversy plaguing the

20:33.800 --> 20:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump administration; and from
dirt to shirt, bringing the
business of cotton back to the

20:38.966 --> 20:41.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

20:41.033 --> 20:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: Researchers have
been watching for months,
waiting for a huge iceberg to

20:45.933 --> 20:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
break away from an ice
shelf in Antarctica.

20:49.233 --> 20:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That break was confirmed today.

20:51.500 --> 20:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to give you a sense
of the size, the volume of the
iceberg is said to be twice

20:56.033 --> 20:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as large as Lake Erie.

20:58.533 --> 21:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has been watching
all this and digging into the
larger questions about the

21:02.700 --> 21:03.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ice shelf.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's an update to
an earlier report.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly segment
on the Leading Edge of science.

21:09.900 --> 21:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This fast-growing
rift in the Antarctica ice
just created one of the largest

21:17.033 --> 21:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icebergs ever recorded,
about the size of Delaware,
weighing more than one trillion

21:23.000 --> 21:24.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tons.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The event had been
anticipated for months.

21:27.900 --> 21:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, some time between
Monday and today, the Larsen
Sea Ice Shelf became 12 percent

21:34.866 --> 21:36.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
smaller.

21:36.366 --> 21:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have known about this
for quite a while, right?

21:38.433 --> 21:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT, University
of Maryland: We have
certainly known about
the bulk of this rift

21:40.966 --> 21:43.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a while.

21:43.066 --> 21:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kelly Brunt is a
glaciologist at the University
of Maryland and NASA's Goddard

21:46.566 --> 21:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Space Flight Center.

21:48.666 --> 21:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She used a wall of monitors
there to show me the growing
rift, fueled in part by rising

21:54.566 --> 21:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
air and sea temperatures.

21:56.666 --> 22:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the glaciers in West
Antarctica all dropped
into the water, global
sea level would rise

22:02.266 --> 22:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by more than 15 feet.

22:04.500 --> 22:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brunt showed me the big
picture, a composite of images
from several satellites.

22:10.566 --> 22:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is how the
glacier ice flows here.

22:12.700 --> 22:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Ice flows from
the center of the continent
out to the edges, much like

22:19.200 --> 22:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
syrup on the center of
your pancake flowing
towards the edges.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see there are
areas where it's moving pretty
slowly, and then there are areas

22:24.700 --> 22:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's moving very quickly.

22:27.066 --> 22:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those quick places
are generally in our
areas of ice shelves.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, when we
think about ice, we think
about something static.

22:34.466 --> 22:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not static, is it?

22:35.466 --> 22:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT: Not at all.

22:36.533 --> 22:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Actually, it's highly dynamic.

22:38.466 --> 22:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can see from this
image it looks to me a
lot like a river system.

22:42.800 --> 22:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice shelves
are connected to the glaciers
that sit on land, but they are

22:49.266 --> 22:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also floating, like ice
cubes in a glass of water.

22:51.566 --> 22:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you had a drink
with ice cubes in it, as those
ice cube melts, they don't

22:56.433 --> 23:00.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
add to the height of
the water in the glass.

23:00.866 --> 23:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when ice shelves break down
and collapse, they do not have
a direct impact on mean sea

23:07.033 --> 23:08.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
level rise.

23:08.266 --> 23:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
However, they have
an indirect effect.

23:10.300 --> 23:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These ice shelves buttress
the flow of the ice upstream,
the ice that's flowing into

23:15.500 --> 23:17.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

23:17.533 --> 23:20.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you lose that
buttressing force,
you allow the upstream
glaciers to flow faster.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's similar to putting
more ice cubes into the
glass and letting those melt.

23:24.933 --> 23:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice falls off the
edge of glaciers all the time.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is part of a natural
process called calving.

23:32.733 --> 23:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kelly Brunt says it is important
to judge the size of the
piece that breaks off relative

23:39.066 --> 23:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the size of the
glacier that is behind it.

23:41.333 --> 23:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says your fingernails
offer a handy model.

23:44.633 --> 23:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you break
your fingernail inside the
white part of your fingernail,

23:48.533 --> 23:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you probably don't
think much of it.

23:50.733 --> 23:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you break it below the
white part, you put a Band-Aid
on it, you think about it and

23:55.333 --> 23:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you keep an eye on it.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you lose your whole
fingernail, I don't
know what happens.

23:59.333 --> 24:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's pretty catastrophic.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This represents losing
the whole fingernail.

24:03.333 --> 24:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Like so many
features in Antarctica,
the Larsen Ice Shelf
is named for a famous

24:08.900 --> 24:11.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
19th century explorer.

24:11.666 --> 24:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it is disappearing,
section by section,
identified by letters.

24:17.533 --> 24:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Larsen A disintegrated in 1995.

24:20.033 --> 24:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in 2002, a series
of satellite images
captured the end of Larsen
B in dramatic fashion

24:27.533 --> 24:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the course of six weeks.

24:30.100 --> 24:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The piece that broke off was
the size of Rhode Island.

24:33.300 --> 24:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Losing this much
ice, losing ice that represents
roughly the state of Rhode

24:38.100 --> 24:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Island in a month-and-a-half,
just far exceeded
anybody's expectations
of what could happen

24:42.566 --> 24:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the time scale
that it could happen.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, it was kind
of like, we have to rethink
things here a little bit.

24:47.566 --> 24:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a wakeup call.

24:49.033 --> 24:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This was
absolutely a wakeup call.

24:51.433 --> 24:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists track
the ice using a half-dozen
U.S. and European satellites,

24:57.600 --> 25:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including Landsat, which
gathered these images.

25:01.033 --> 25:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But some of their best data came
from a satellite called ICESat.

25:04.933 --> 25:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Launched in 2003, it
ceased operation in 2009.

25:11.366 --> 25:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It precisely measured the
glaciers using laser beams.

25:13.800 --> 25:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This is quite
a few years of ICESat data
merged together to get a sense

25:20.200 --> 25:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in meters per year how
our ice sheet is changing.

25:23.266 --> 25:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see, the big picture
here is that our ice sheets
are changing where they are

25:27.033 --> 25:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in contact with both our warming
atmosphere and a warming ocean.

25:30.733 --> 25:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's basically along
the fringe of the continent.

25:33.366 --> 25:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When ICESat
failed, NASA started
tracking the ice using
radar and lasers on

25:39.466 --> 25:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
board low-flying aircraft.

25:42.500 --> 25:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The IceBridge program is NASA's
largest air campaign ever,
but it still could not match

25:48.233 --> 25:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the eye above the sky.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It goes without saying that you
would view these satellites,
the capability to look at

25:54.633 --> 25:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this, as essential?

25:56.666 --> 26:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: What we're talking
about is a calving of an iceberg
that's a size of a state.

26:00.433 --> 26:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get that, you really need
a satellite to be able to
see all of it in one shot.

26:05.266 --> 26:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a function of scale and
repeatability to go back and
look at that area again with

26:12.266 --> 26:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the satellite that makes these
the perfect tools for looking
at the large-scale change

26:15.033 --> 26:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we're seeing
in this region.

26:17.500 --> 26:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And that's
precisely what Kelly
Brunt and her colleagues
will be doing now,

26:21.400 --> 26:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using satellite data, data
from the scant weather stations
that are on the surface there,

26:27.833 --> 26:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and additionally with buoys
which are in the water itself.

26:30.833 --> 26:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be poring over this
data over the course of actually
years to try to make some

26:37.866 --> 26:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of definitive statement
-- and I put definitive in
quotes because it's science,

26:40.600 --> 26:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after all -- as to whether
this particular calving event
is linked to climate change

26:46.200 --> 26:48.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - Judy.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is
there a definitive answer
to that at this point?

26:49.900 --> 26:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It sounds like you're saying no.

26:51.166 --> 26:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Not just yet.

26:53.266 --> 26:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's what we know.

26:55.300 --> 26:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Larsen B, the previous big
calving event, scientists say
there is a very strong pile

26:58.933 --> 27:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of evidence indicating it
is linked to climate change.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Larsen A, they have
practically no data at all.

27:05.133 --> 27:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's one of these things
that, as Kelly Brunt put it,
this is where it gets exciting

27:11.266 --> 27:13.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for scientists.

27:13.233 --> 27:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will try to determine
if it's climate change that
actually caused this to happen,

27:16.200 --> 27:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also they will be
looking at the stability
of the ice shelf behind it.

27:20.633 --> 27:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does the flow increase?

27:22.300 --> 27:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What about the glacier
behind the ice shelf itself?

27:26.033 --> 27:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Looking at all that will give
them a lot of clues about what
this is going to mean ultimately

27:29.566 --> 27:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sea level rise.

27:31.666 --> 27:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
that, do they know the effect
this is going to have on sea

27:36.933 --> 27:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
levels in the area
and around the world?

27:39.133 --> 27:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes,
that's the big question.

27:41.266 --> 27:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Larsen C, even though
it's called a shelf,
it's kind of misleading.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was already in the water.

27:47.066 --> 27:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so like an ice cube in a
glass of water, it had already
done its bit of displacement

27:51.333 --> 27:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and already had made its
impact on sea level rise.

27:54.233 --> 27:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it had fallen off, scientists
estimate it would have
increased sea level across the

27:58.666 --> 28:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world by three millimeters.

28:00.733 --> 28:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That the gives you the
idea of the size of this.

28:02.833 --> 28:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, now the situation here is
to see whether the increased
rate, if there's an increased

28:09.666 --> 28:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate in the flow of that ice
shelf into the water, what
impact that might have on sea

28:14.433 --> 28:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
level rise in coming years.

28:16.433 --> 28:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, Judy, this is
long-term science, and we will
just have to watch it for years

28:19.900 --> 28:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

28:22.266 --> 28:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
Miles, what happens
to this gigantic piece
of ice now that it's

28:24.666 --> 28:26.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
broken off?

28:26.633 --> 28:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, it
will probably not stay
intact the size of Delaware.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will break up over time.

28:31.700 --> 28:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fortunately, where it is,
it's not going to be in the
way of any shipping channels.

28:36.033 --> 28:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it shouldn't be a hazard
to navigation, but that's a
big part of what is going to

28:40.033 --> 28:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happen along with
the other research.

28:42.166 --> 28:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will be tracking to see
how this iceberg breaks up.

28:45.233 --> 28:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it will be a big
iceberg to start, and over
time it will get smaller.

28:50.066 --> 28:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
our iceberg man, Miles
O'Brien, thank you very much.

28:56.200 --> 29:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Judy.

29:04.200 --> 29:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we
continue our series
Inside Putin's Russia, and
travel to the country's

29:12.500 --> 29:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
southernmost border.

29:14.533 --> 29:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republic of Dagestan
is in the North Caucasus,
near the Caspian Sea.

29:18.266 --> 29:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the past two decades, a
brutal separatist insurgency has
fought the Russian state, and

29:25.200 --> 29:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence has spilled over
from neighboring Chechnya,
where Russia fought two wars.

29:31.366 --> 29:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many Americans may recall
Dagestan as the original home
of the Boston Marathon bombers,

29:36.100 --> 29:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but now a new problem.

29:37.800 --> 29:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
By one estimate, as
many as 5,000 Dagestanis
are fighting for ISIS.

29:44.733 --> 29:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, in partnership with
the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting, special correspondent

29:49.300 --> 29:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nick Schifrin and producer
Zach Fannin examine why.

29:52.500 --> 29:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAZIM NURMAGOMETOV, Russia: It
is no accident that the youth
are tempted to go to Syria,

30:01.766 --> 30:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because, today, there
is a revival of Islam.

30:05.233 --> 30:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kazim
Nurmagometov is 62 years old,
and his son fought for ISIS.

30:12.266 --> 30:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was never tempted to go to
Syria, but he and his wife,
Rashida, understand why their

30:15.833 --> 30:17.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
son, Marat, was.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAZIM NURMAGOMETOV (through
translator): The Islamic call
I was talking about, the one

30:20.566 --> 30:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in every Muslim's soul,
is hidden deep down.

30:23.633 --> 30:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's like a light
in someone's heart.

30:26.033 --> 30:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nurmagometov
lives deep in the Caucasus
Mountains, where nearly dried-up

30:30.300 --> 30:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rivers meander through
1,000-foot-high cliffs,
and beyond ancient rock
formations, isolated

30:36.533 --> 30:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dirt roads connect
secluded villages.

30:39.766 --> 30:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of those villages is Karata.

30:41.733 --> 30:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Official population is
4,000, but residents
say it's half that size.

30:47.966 --> 30:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This area is nearly
100 percent Muslim.

30:50.433 --> 30:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Before Friday prayers,
men greet each other in
the small town center.

30:53.833 --> 30:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are few young people, in
part because this small village
sent as many as two dozen

30:57.666 --> 31:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to ISIS, al-Qaida, and the
wars in Syria and Iraq.

31:01.233 --> 31:02.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's her?

31:02.233 --> 31:03.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's your daughter.

31:03.733 --> 31:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMINA KONDAKOVA, Russia
(through translator): Yes.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Amina
Kondakova is a Muslim convert.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She shows me photos
from a happier time.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's very cute.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says they grew up
traditional and comfortable.

31:11.633 --> 31:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, two years ago, her
daughter Miryam and her son
Ali Askhat told her they were

31:15.400 --> 31:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going on vacation.

31:17.433 --> 31:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, they traveled
with Miriam's husband to
Mosul, Iraq, to join ISIS.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMINA KONDAKOVA (through
translator): They lied
to me about going there.

31:23.866 --> 31:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was so disappointed.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then I became afraid about
what could happen to them.

31:28.266 --> 31:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She says
this town is pious,
but wasn't religious
enough for her daughter.

31:32.266 --> 31:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did she feel judged by
people in this society?

31:36.400 --> 31:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMINA KONDAKOVA (through
translator): Yes,
they gave her looks.

31:39.433 --> 31:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't like how
she was dressing.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They wanted her to dress
like everyone else.

31:43.500 --> 31:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She wanted to dress to
way it's written for a
Muslim woman to dress.

31:47.033 --> 31:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kondakova
believes that judgment
drove her daughter away.

31:51.466 --> 31:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She reluctantly admits that,
in Mosul, her daughter is happy
raising her first grandson.

31:55.566 --> 31:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMINA KONDAKOVA (through
translator): "Mom, I feel
like I was reborn here.

31:59.033 --> 32:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I regret all those years
I spent in Dagestan.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Don't you want to come here too?

32:03.233 --> 32:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to live with you, want
you to see my boy growing up."

32:05.666 --> 32:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nurmagometov
gets to see his grandson.

32:09.833 --> 32:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When his son Marat left
for Syria, he abandoned
a pregnant wife.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alexey is now 3 years old.

32:17.766 --> 32:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They look at photos of Marat
as a boy, and a young Marat
clowning around with his older

32:21.666 --> 32:23.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
brother, Shamil.

32:23.633 --> 32:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you look at these, does
it make you wish that your
sons could all be here with you

32:27.500 --> 32:29.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together?

32:29.033 --> 32:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAZIM NURMAGOMETOV (through
translator): I am a realist.

32:30.466 --> 32:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know there's no return.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Life isn't a book where you
can tear out the pages if you
didn't like what you wrote, and

32:36.633 --> 32:38.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
write new ones.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The Dagestanis
who fought for ISIS continue
a decades-old legacy here of

32:42.400 --> 32:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
radicalism and militancy.

32:44.400 --> 32:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been a local insurgency
here in the capital of Dagestan,
Makhachkala, for years,

32:51.300 --> 32:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targeting both local
authorities and symbols of
the national government.

32:54.633 --> 32:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their most prominent
attacks targeted civilians
in larger cities.

32:58.200 --> 33:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Moscow in 2010, militants
allied with al-Qaida
blew up the subway.

33:02.833 --> 33:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2013 in Volgograd, they blew
up a bus station, and then a
commuter bus, as seen on Russian

33:08.400 --> 33:10.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

33:10.433 --> 33:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HABIB MAGOMEDOV, Former Police
Lieutenant Colonel (through
translator): There was no

33:13.400 --> 33:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
social or physical protection.

33:15.966 --> 33:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every day, there were
bombings, terror attacks
that cost people's lives.

33:20.266 --> 33:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Habib Magomedov
is a former police lieutenant
colonel and member of Dagestan's

33:24.400 --> 33:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anti-terrorism committee.

33:26.533 --> 33:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says conservative Islam,
combined with high rates of
unemployment and poverty, to

33:31.800 --> 33:34.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
radicalize.

33:34.300 --> 33:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HABIB MAGOMEDOV (through
translator): It's the
living conditions,
absence of possibilities,

33:39.033 --> 33:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absence of social mobility,
which creates waves
of anger and distress.

33:41.133 --> 33:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has to be some sort of
history that sets the person
on a certain track, where

33:45.433 --> 33:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you only need to light a
match for the fire to start.

33:49.200 --> 33:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That
match is often a brutal
security crackdown.

33:53.633 --> 33:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In January 2013, Russian
special forces flooded
into Dagestani villages.

34:00.733 --> 34:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Locals say security
services have practiced
collective punishment
against entire families,

34:03.366 --> 34:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
torture, even
extrajudicial executions.

34:06.833 --> 34:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Magomedov admits they went
too far, but he tries to
explain their motivation.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HABIB MAGOMEDOV (through
translator): If keeping
people safe requires
limiting rights and freedoms

34:14.800 --> 34:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of certain individuals,
it's probably worth it.

34:17.533 --> 34:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My brother died in 1998
when someone threw a
grenade in his house.

34:21.733 --> 34:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the freedom of
one man ends where the
freedom of another starts.

34:26.133 --> 34:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today, the
violence has diminished.

34:30.133 --> 34:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's still religious
Muslims whose freedoms
are most often restricted.

34:36.566 --> 34:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This mosque practices an austere
and aggressive form of Islam.

34:38.566 --> 34:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also rails against
government policy, and that
makes it a police target.

34:44.700 --> 34:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
After prayers, police
set up a checkpoint.

34:47.333 --> 34:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officers must meet a
monthly quota of arrests,
leading to what many call
indiscriminate detentions,

34:52.966 --> 34:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including of journalists trying
to tell the mosque's story.

34:55.600 --> 35:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were filming that scene
from across the street, just
standing on the sidewalk for

35:00.200 --> 35:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only about 90 seconds, when
police came up and arrested us.

35:03.466 --> 35:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They threw us into their car.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They drove us to the precinct.

35:06.266 --> 35:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They refused to tell us
why they were arresting us.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is he being arrested?

35:11.466 --> 35:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we were in the station,
we saw dozens of men who had
been in that mosque before

35:16.166 --> 35:17.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also arrested.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is simply how
people here act.

35:19.533 --> 35:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thirty-three-year-old
Mogamet Mogametov is
the mosque's spokesman.

35:22.533 --> 35:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOGAMET MOGAMETOV, Mosque
Spokesman (through translator):
As you saw yourself, they arrest

35:26.766 --> 35:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people not because they're
suspicious, but only because
they came to a mosque.

35:30.600 --> 35:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you think
that the tactics that the police
use can help to radicalize

35:34.200 --> 35:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
young people here?

35:35.700 --> 35:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MOGAMET MOGAMETOV (through
translator): Of course.

35:37.533 --> 35:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the thing
that provokes people.

35:39.633 --> 35:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since literally everyone can
be arrested, not on the basis
of actual cause, but something

35:43.933 --> 35:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
totally subjective, then
of course that irritates.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And that
helped lead so many to ISIS.

35:49.966 --> 35:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The group exploits the abuse.

35:52.866 --> 35:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian language propaganda says
Russia oppresses Muslims, and
presents Syria and Iraq as a

35:58.733 --> 36:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pious paradise fit for families.

36:00.900 --> 36:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as ISIS recruited
Dagestanis, Russian
security services showed
some the door, exporting

36:07.066 --> 36:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extremism by facilitating
their travel to Syria.

36:08.766 --> 36:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HABIB MAGOMEDOV (through
translator): It was
the right thing to do.

36:12.600 --> 36:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since the moment these people
left Dagestan for Syria, local
terrorism dropped dramatically.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they had stayed, there
would have been terror attacks.

36:20.433 --> 36:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There would have been
human casualties.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Who
helped you leave?

36:23.466 --> 36:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who facilitated your departure?

36:25.733 --> 36:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of those who was pushed
is this 27-year-old Dagestani
who now lives in Turkey.

36:30.066 --> 36:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We agreed to hide his
face and alter his voice.

36:33.033 --> 36:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
People who were on the federal
wanted list could somehow get

36:37.233 --> 36:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a passport and
leave the country.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some security officers said to
them, we will either kill you
or you can leave the country.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The way I was helped was that
every time I went to my local
government office, I was

36:46.666 --> 36:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
taken by the police
and interrogated.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But when I went to get a
passport, nobody stopped me.

36:50.800 --> 36:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And after the
Dagestanis left, Russia made
sure they never came back.

36:55.166 --> 36:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
simply said that, if I come
back, they will do bad things

36:59.033 --> 37:00.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I won't ever go back.

37:02.166 --> 37:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Many Dagestanis
who fought for ISIS have died
in Syria, and they're celebrated

37:06.133 --> 37:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by ISIS propaganda.

37:09.166 --> 37:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some managed to
escape, often to the port
city of Odessa, Ukraine.

37:13.866 --> 37:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former ISIS fighter Marat
agreed to talk to us if
we didn't show his face.

37:17.266 --> 37:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARAT, Former ISIS Fighter
(through translator):
The majority went to
Syria with the notion

37:20.066 --> 37:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of jihad, that Assad was
repressing Muslims and
we needed to help them.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: We have
actually already met Marat.

37:26.700 --> 37:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's the son of
Kazim Nurmagometov.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kazim is often in
Odessa to visit.

37:30.966 --> 37:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAZIM NURMAGOMETOV
(through translator): We
consider our family lucky.

37:34.833 --> 37:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is back, alive and healthy,
and realized that where he
ended up wasn't what he thought

37:39.266 --> 37:41.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it was.

37:41.366 --> 37:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: When his son
left for Syria, Kazim didn't
sit back and let him die.

37:44.266 --> 37:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He traveled to the outskirts of
Aleppo and saw the destruction.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He helped convince
Marat he made a mistake.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marat finally left when he
thought about his own son.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARAT (through translator):
I was thinking about him
constantly, hoping that I could

37:56.633 --> 37:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leave and see my child.

37:58.133 --> 38:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was always thinking about
what a big mistake I made.

38:00.433 --> 38:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank God I was able to leave
there alive, because practically
everyone I knew there,

38:04.866 --> 38:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no one is left alive.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They all died there.

38:07.400 --> 38:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Marat will
never return here, to Dagestan.

38:11.766 --> 38:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what has
inspired Kazim to speak on
camera for the first time.

38:15.100 --> 38:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAZIM NURMAGOMETOV (through
translator): There are thousands
of ISIS fighters in Syria who

38:18.533 --> 38:19.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
want to leave.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I feel it.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe my story will be
a lesson, how to do it,
what obstacles to expect.

38:24.533 --> 38:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I feel some sort of
responsibility to
use my experience to
help get others out.

38:28.866 --> 38:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: People like
Kazim's neighbor, Amina.

38:31.966 --> 38:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She fears her daughter is dead.

38:33.666 --> 38:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She hasn't heard from
her in four months.

38:35.766 --> 38:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would you say to that
mother in America who's
listening to your story?

38:42.733 --> 38:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMINA KONDAKOVA (through
translator): Don't let
your children go anywhere.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look after them.

38:47.033 --> 38:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look after their every step, but
don't let them leave you, ever.

38:51.366 --> 38:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But their
children have left this place.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And most will never return.

38:57.033 --> 39:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin in Karata, Dagestan.

39:01.733 --> 39:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our week-long
series Inside Putin's Russia
continues tomorrow with a look

39:08.133 --> 39:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at what happens to those who
dare to stand up to the Kremlin.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return now to the top story
of the day, Donald Trump Jr.'s
release of e-mails showing

39:28.000 --> 39:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he met with a Russian lawyer
during the 2016 presidential
campaign, in hopes of gaining

39:32.233 --> 39:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
damaging information
about Hillary Clinton.

39:35.200 --> 39:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a closer look at the
political fallout from all this,
we turn to Karine Jean-Pierre,

39:39.833 --> 39:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a senior adviser to
MoveOn.org and a veteran of
the Obama administration.

39:46.900 --> 39:50.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Matt Schlapp, he's
the chairman of the
American Conservative
Union and the former

39:50.066 --> 39:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deputy political director
for President George W. Bush.

39:54.233 --> 39:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's great to have you
both back on the program.

39:56.300 --> 39:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for being here.

39:57.300 --> 39:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Karine, to you first.

39:59.333 --> 40:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How damaging is all this
information about the
Donald Trump Jr. meeting?

40:01.300 --> 40:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE,
Democratic Strategist: I
think it's pretty damaging.

40:03.866 --> 40:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We finally have evidence,
e-mails, that were not
fake news, because it
was actually delivered,

40:09.900 --> 40:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released by Don Jr., that shows
that a foreign - - he met --
he and Paul Manafort and Jared

40:15.400 --> 40:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner met with a foreign
agent in the sole, sole purpose
of trying to get information

40:22.033 --> 40:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given by a foreign
adversary, intelligence
from a foreign adversary.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
pretty damaging.

40:27.533 --> 40:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, for a long time,
Republicans have been
moving that goalpost, right?

40:31.266 --> 40:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have been saying,
oh, there's no meeting.

40:34.133 --> 40:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, well, if there's no meeting,
there's no proof of collusion.

40:37.433 --> 40:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Nobody on the campaign
knows any -- or have
any Russian connections.

40:40.133 --> 40:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, now we're at a point
where, yes, there's a meeting.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It looks like there potentially
could have been collusion.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And now what?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now what do Republicans do?

40:48.566 --> 40:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt, how do
you see the damage, or not?

40:50.600 --> 40:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director of Political Affairs:
Well, you know, my -- what

40:52.633 --> 40:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have said continually is,
is that my guess is, in the
presidential campaign, they will

40:57.466 --> 41:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have e-mails or phone
conversations or meetings
with people that were
trying to be helpful

41:02.066 --> 41:03.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the campaign.

41:03.333 --> 41:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this doesn't come
as a big shock to me.

41:05.933 --> 41:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the big mistake
they have made is whenever
you're involved in one
of these investigations

41:12.466 --> 41:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - and I was in a White
House that had a special
counsel -- you search
your e-mails immediately.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You go through -- if you
have phone logs, and you look
through all your information,

41:17.800 --> 41:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you just fully comply,
you're as completely
as transparent as
you possibly can be.

41:21.900 --> 41:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, the reason we know
this is because Jared Kushner
and Paul Manafort updated the

41:28.800 --> 41:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disclosure to the government,
and they were much more
fulsome in the information they

41:31.633 --> 41:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gave, which was the
right thing to do.

41:33.733 --> 41:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just would have been
better if that could have
done as soon as possible.

41:36.333 --> 41:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the drip, drip, drip that
gives the press the ability to
write another story and another

41:40.433 --> 41:41.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the underlying facts still
prove absolutely no criminality.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Absolutely
no criminality?

41:46.700 --> 41:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We had a discussion
about this a few minutes
ago with two lawyers.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, we don't
know that for sure.

41:52.066 --> 41:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, look, to me, it looks
like textbook collusion.

41:55.300 --> 42:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looks like campaign finance
violation, at least for me,
someone who worked on campaigns

42:00.133 --> 42:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, just like yourself,
worked in the White House.

42:01.933 --> 42:03.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:03.466 --> 42:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, but you guys
were never under investigation.

42:04.533 --> 42:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

42:05.700 --> 42:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We were never under
investigation.

42:06.866 --> 42:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thanks goodness, Obama,
no investigation.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Because
we were pretty nice.

42:09.566 --> 42:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were pretty nice.

42:10.733 --> 42:12.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:12.266 --> 42:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But, look --
but I think this is the problem.

42:14.300 --> 42:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they want true transparency
-- this is they, the Trump
administration -- why don't

42:18.733 --> 42:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just they put it all out there?

42:20.066 --> 42:21.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:21.966 --> 42:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: That's why
Donald Trump Jr. did this,
because it's the right thing to

42:22.666 --> 42:24.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, but
the only reason they do it is
because you have The Washington

42:26.766 --> 42:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Post out there and The New
York Times doing the work and
putting out the information in

42:31.400 --> 42:32.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
piecemeal.

42:32.666 --> 42:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then the drip, drip,
drip stuff happens.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Or maybe they're
being leaked inside the White
House or inside the apparatus.

42:36.333 --> 42:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, then
that's Donald Trump's problem.

42:37.966 --> 42:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Can I go,
Judy, to this question
of an FEC violation?

42:38.766 --> 42:40.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

42:40.466 --> 42:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Because
I saw the conversation
in the show as well.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the FEC has put
on their Web site...

42:44.200 --> 42:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
Federal Elections Commission.

42:45.566 --> 42:46.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can go on their Web
site and check it out.

42:48.933 --> 42:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they already said
that the idea that you
could prove criminality
unless there was cash

42:52.300 --> 42:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that went directly to
a candidate is almost
impossible to prove.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think the FEC
violations here are absurd.

42:58.933 --> 43:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The idea that this is treason,
that this was taking up arms
against your own country, I

43:03.466 --> 43:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think, is absurd.

43:05.433 --> 43:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you have this question
of collusion, which isn't
really a legal term.

43:08.266 --> 43:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I love this, potential
collusion, and I don't even
know where you go on that.

43:11.333 --> 43:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, the bottom line
is, we want to know this.

43:13.866 --> 43:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did anybody on team Trump
do anything illegal with
the Putin government
that somehow subverted

43:20.133 --> 43:22.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the elections?

43:22.100 --> 43:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a pretty big
charge, but an easy charge
to eventually answer.

43:25.666 --> 43:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we all just
want to get that answer and
close the books on this.

43:28.766 --> 43:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The American people are
fair, and let's move on.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the standard
of legality, Karine, going
to be the only standard that

43:34.933 --> 43:36.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
matters here?

43:36.433 --> 43:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: So, I
think that matters as well.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do have -- we cannot
forget that Russians actually
attacked our country.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They tried to undermine
our democracy.

43:44.166 --> 43:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is actually
still happening.

43:46.700 --> 43:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a Washington
Post recent reporting
that showed that Russians
were currently trying

43:52.133 --> 43:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to hack into our infrastructure.

43:54.200 --> 43:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this is what I'm not
understanding why Republicans
aren't just standing up and

43:58.600 --> 44:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying something and keeping
Trump administration and
his associates accountable.

44:01.866 --> 44:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I agree with this.

44:03.866 --> 44:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what Russia has tried
to do in this most recent
election and previous elections

44:07.333 --> 44:09.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is wrong.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's wrong what the DNC
was doing with the government
of Ukraine to try to help

44:11.800 --> 44:13.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

44:13.066 --> 44:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think these things
really should be...

44:14.233 --> 44:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Not the same.

44:15.233 --> 44:17.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not the same.

44:17.733 --> 44:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, but
it is -- if you shouldn't
deal with a foreign
national, then you shouldn't

44:18.666 --> 44:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal with a foreign national.

44:20.166 --> 44:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Russia
is a foreign adversary.

44:20.966 --> 44:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not the same.

44:21.766 --> 44:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The DNC denied it.

44:22.966 --> 44:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Russia is not --
is a foreign adversary.

44:24.500 --> 44:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to come
to something, because there...

44:25.500 --> 44:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

44:28.066 --> 44:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What has
struck me, Matt Schlapp,
is the comments from
conservative commentators

44:31.066 --> 44:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the last day or so
about what's happening,
Charles Krauthammer,
who said last night:

44:35.266 --> 44:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been defending
this White House, this
administration for months.

44:38.233 --> 44:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I find out what they
were doing, and I'm left
basically hanging out to dry.

44:45.666 --> 44:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you seeing some Republicans,
some conservatives feeling as if
the administration hasn't been

44:51.400 --> 44:52.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
straight with them?

44:52.200 --> 44:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Of course.

44:54.533 --> 44:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you're seeing from
Republicans and conservatives,
when you see the drip,
drip, drip, and with

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this revelation that there
was a meeting, it does
get people concerned.

45:04.433 --> 45:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say, well, I didn't think
there was going to be a meeting.

45:05.666 --> 45:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I thought I would have
learned this by now.

45:07.366 --> 45:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's why getting all
the information out
is awfully important.

45:10.166 --> 45:12.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Get it all out.

45:12.266 --> 45:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My advice is to anybody
listening on the Trump
team, get the e-mails
out, get the calendar

45:15.133 --> 45:16.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
items out.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Get everything out.

45:17.633 --> 45:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you have nothing to hide,
just put it all out there.

45:19.700 --> 45:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's what now they
have done with the refiling
of their disclosures, which is

45:24.233 --> 45:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why we know about this meeting.

45:25.700 --> 45:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was their disclosure
that is the reason we know this.

45:28.433 --> 45:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Jr., yes, he put out
his e-mails, but it was also
true that the media had gotten

45:32.200 --> 45:34.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

45:34.266 --> 45:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, having full disclosure
will calm people down, because
all really conservatives care

45:37.500 --> 45:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about at the end, Judy,
is, was there wrongdoing?

45:39.900 --> 45:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, we are
seeing, in poll after poll --
I haven't seen polls since this

45:44.366 --> 45:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest information came
out -- but the conservative
- - Donald Trump's voting
base, they are sticking

45:50.766 --> 45:52.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

45:52.266 --> 45:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're saying, we don't care
about Russia, for the most part.

45:53.533 --> 45:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm making a bit
of a blanket statement here.

45:57.066 --> 45:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're saying, what we
want to see is, we want to see
something done about health

45:58.933 --> 46:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care, we want to see jobs.

46:00.433 --> 46:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I
think that's exactly right.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's the thing.

46:04.500 --> 46:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Voters didn't care about
Watergate, until they did.

46:07.533 --> 46:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the issue that I have with
that is, these elected officials
on the Hill have a duty,

46:14.233 --> 46:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have a responsibility,
regardless if
voters care or not.

46:16.766 --> 46:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They took an oath to
protect the Constitution,
to defend the Constitution
against all enemies,

46:22.566 --> 46:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreign or domestic.

46:24.666 --> 46:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, therefore, they
should care that there was
an attack on our country.

46:27.200 --> 46:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that is what is
really kind of getting under
my skin, is, this is truly,

46:32.900 --> 46:34.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truly important.

46:34.566 --> 46:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
do have the committees
doing the investigation.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, the only
thing I would say to that
is, is that what Russia tries

46:38.700 --> 46:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do with our cyber-security
in our society on a daily basis
with espionage is a big problem.

46:44.466 --> 46:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I agree with you on that.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I actually the Obama
administration -- he was
in charge during this
period of time -- he

46:49.266 --> 46:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually left us vulnerable.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He left our potentially -- if
you're making the charge that
they had something to do with

46:53.733 --> 46:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our election system, he
was the sheriff in town.

46:55.833 --> 46:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The DNC was hacked.

46:57.866 --> 47:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that what we need to
do is make sure that we work in
a bipartisan way to make sure

47:00.666 --> 47:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they can't affect
our society this way.

47:02.533 --> 47:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But
Republicans are making
this a partisan issue.

47:04.700 --> 47:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not being bipartisan.

47:06.233 --> 47:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think there is a
little bit of that to go around.

47:08.266 --> 47:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Mitch
McConnell hasn't stood up basic
rhetoric, not real conversation

47:10.433 --> 47:11.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about it, and Paul Ryan.

47:11.666 --> 47:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They need to stand
up and speak louder.

47:13.266 --> 47:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

47:14.866 --> 47:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We may have another chance
to talk about this again.

47:18.233 --> 47:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It may not be the last chance.

47:19.800 --> 47:20.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:20.800 --> 47:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Sorry, Judy.

47:21.966 --> 47:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Karine Jean-Pierre.

47:22.800 --> 47:23.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's all right.

47:23.800 --> 47:24.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Matt Schlapp.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for being here.

47:25.966 --> 47:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: I'm
hopeful for a new topic.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:27.800 --> 47:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I bet you are.

47:29.733 --> 47:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thanks, Judy.

47:36.300 --> 47:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

47:43.300 --> 47:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, take a moment now to
check that label inside the
collar of your cotton shirt.

47:49.933 --> 47:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chances are, it doesn't say
made in the USA, even though
the cotton it's made from was

47:54.233 --> 47:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
probably grown in the USA.

47:56.733 --> 48:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cotton farmers in North Carolina
are trying to change that,
teaming up with local textile

48:01.600 --> 48:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mills to produce garments
that are truly homegrown.

48:05.266 --> 48:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now around a dozen companies
are selling clothing
that can be traced back
to local cotton fields.

48:12.766 --> 48:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From PBS station WTVI in
Charlotte, Jeff Sonier
shows us how Carolina
textile towns are bouncing

48:18.066 --> 48:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
back after years of
mills closing down
and jobs moving out.

48:25.066 --> 48:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: Inside this North
Carolina textile factory, it's
the sound of survival, or maybe

48:33.600 --> 48:35.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
revival.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC HENRY, Textile Factory
Owner: When NAFTA hit, they
basically said textiles in this

48:37.900 --> 48:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country are dead.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You either go overseas,
or you go out of business.

48:42.233 --> 48:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: That was the hard
choice facing textile factory
owner Eric Henry, the same

48:49.266 --> 48:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard choice that killed these
other Carolina textile mills,
along with the textile jobs

48:53.166 --> 48:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they provided for generations.

48:54.700 --> 48:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: Time was when cotton
was king of the coastal plain.

48:57.833 --> 48:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIC HENRY: There would be over
100 people working in here.

48:59.966 --> 49:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our customers were Tommy,
Nike, Gap, Polo, Adidas,
high-level branded companies.

49:08.100 --> 49:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Within two years, we laid
off 80 percent of our staff.

49:11.633 --> 49:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The brands could not get
overseas quick enough.

49:14.833 --> 49:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when I realized
there's more to business
than a bottom line.

49:18.433 --> 49:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's when we realized
we wanted to be a
different business.

49:21.333 --> 49:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: And for Henry's
business, being different
means not just made in the USA,

49:28.233 --> 49:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but what he calls dirt-to-shirt,
products sewn here in the
Carolinas from cotton that's

49:34.300 --> 49:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
grown here in the Carolinas.

49:36.366 --> 49:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, you know, with all the
struggles that Carolina cotton
mills have been through over

49:40.733 --> 49:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the past couple of years, you
would figure Carolina cotton
farmers would be struggling,

49:45.000 --> 49:46.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, actually, it's
just the opposite.

49:48.800 --> 49:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the farmers
say, just like this field
we're standing in right
now, that their business

49:51.566 --> 49:53.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is actually growing.

49:53.366 --> 49:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUTCH BROOKS, Cotton Farmer:
Well, I think it's great.

49:59.766 --> 50:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just we're blessed to be able
to grow a crop like this.

50:01.700 --> 50:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: Butch Brooks grows
his cotton on a 100-year-old
family farm, picking it

50:07.966 --> 50:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from behind the wheel of a
half-million-dollar harvester.

50:10.066 --> 50:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cotton experts say the crop
itself is high-quality, which
translates into high demand.

50:16.600 --> 50:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: This is the cotton
that textile companies
want, absolutely.

50:22.200 --> 50:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Textiles want this quality
cotton for expensive garments,
for high-quality clothing.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: Problem is, after
it's cleaned and baled and
bar coded for sale, most of

50:32.966 --> 50:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this local cotton winds
up in the same place those
local jobs went, overseas.

50:37.566 --> 50:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES MORGAN, Business Owner: This
area of North Carolina was the
center of cotton in the world

50:41.833 --> 50:43.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at one time.

50:43.900 --> 50:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People wanted to be able to go
to the store and buy a shirt
made in the United States.

50:47.033 --> 50:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, right now, there's
almost none of that.

50:49.366 --> 50:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Could we get that again?

50:50.900 --> 50:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Could we have something
completely made
in the Carolinas?

50:53.633 --> 50:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC HENRY: We just believe
there's more to a T-shirt than
just the cost of a T-shirt,

51:00.666 --> 51:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it's made, how it's
made, the impact it has on the
people, the impact it has on

51:05.366 --> 51:06.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the planet.

51:06.266 --> 51:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We grow cotton here.

51:07.266 --> 51:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can make apparel here.

51:09.833 --> 51:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: In fact,
the homegrown, home-sewn
shirts here at Henry's
factory even have special

51:15.300 --> 51:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
color-coded threads in
the hem and the sleeves,
so you can track back
your shirt to the very

51:20.400 --> 51:22.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beginning.

51:22.833 --> 51:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC HENRY: If you take
those two colors, and go
to a Web site, Where --
W-H-E-R-E -- yourclothing.com,

51:28.466 --> 51:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you put in these two colors,
a map pops up, and from that
map, I will introduce you to

51:32.333 --> 51:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the farmer, the ginner,
the spinner, the knitter,
the finisher, the
cut-sew, and T.S. designs.

51:39.300 --> 51:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We make our supply chain
completely transparent all
the way back to the farmer.

51:42.366 --> 51:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: Henry admits his
dirt-to-shirt concept isn't
all that different from those

51:46.900 --> 51:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
popular farm-to-fork
restaurants, and
that's no coincidence.

51:50.533 --> 51:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC HENRY: Offering people
alternatives if they're looking
for something how they can

51:54.466 --> 51:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support their community and
have a better product, and
know where it comes from.

51:59.366 --> 52:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have had great cotton in
this state for a long time.

52:03.133 --> 52:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all we're doing is
reconnecting that cotton to jobs
and textiles back in our state.

52:07.633 --> 52:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SONIER: With a goal of
not putting the cheap overseas
shirt-makers out of business,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but maybe growing and
sewing a whole new business.

52:17.700 --> 52:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeff Sonier in Stanly
County, North Carolina.

52:22.033 --> 52:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And

52:25.766 --> 52:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online
right now: NASA's Juno
spacecraft recently got its
first up-close-and-personal

52:32.700 --> 52:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
view with Jupiter's Great
Red Spot, and today the space
agency has released photos from

52:37.766 --> 52:39.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the flyby.

52:39.666 --> 52:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The images reveal many
tantalizing details about what's
happening in Jupiter's giant

52:44.233 --> 52:46.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
storm.

52:46.333 --> 52:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

and Friday, correspondent

Putin's Russia.

52:59.933 --> 53:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: In Russia today,
resurgent nationalism.

53:03.566 --> 53:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: And authoritarianism
is organic.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not artificial.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Built by
and around one man.

53:10.533 --> 53:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russians told
pollsters that suddenly they
felt like a superpower again.

53:15.266 --> 53:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: But for
Putin's opponents:

53:17.300 --> 53:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: People who have tried
to leave the Putin family
voluntarily have not fared very

53:21.533 --> 53:23.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: A rare look inside
Putin's Russia all next
week on the "PBS NewsHour."
