WEBVTT

00:06.139 --> 00:09.576
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan. Judy
Woodruff is away.

00:09.576 --> 00:15.215
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
nation reflects, from New York,
where the towers fell, to the

00:15.215 --> 00:21.355
Pentagon and a field in
Pennsylvania, remembering those
lost 14 years ago.

00:21.355 --> 00:26.960
Then: the faces of this great,
desperate migration. Our own
William Brangham gets up close
with

00:26.960 --> 00:30.864
some of the families on their
journey, hopscotching their way
through Europe.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.334
Plus, Mark Shields and David
Brooks are here, to analyze the
week's news.

00:34.334 --> 00:40.440
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:40.440 --> 00:44.611
(BREAK)

00:44.611 --> 00:54.621
HARI SREENIVASAN: Americans
looked back today on a day that
changed the world, 9/11.

00:54.621 --> 00:59.059
Crowds were somewhat smaller for
the latest anniversary of the
attacks, but many brought

00:59.059 --> 01:10.537
renewed determination to never
forget. It's become a tradition
on this day of remembrance.

01:10.537 --> 01:23.050
Bells tolled in New York,
Washington, and Shanksville,
Pennsylvania, the sites where

01:23.050 --> 01:29.389
nearly 3,000 people died at the
hands of al-Qaida skyjackers 14
years ago.

01:29.389 --> 01:34.294
The day began with a moment of
silence at the White House, 8:46
a.m., when the first

01:34.294 --> 01:39.132
of two airliners hurtled into
the Twin Towers in New York. And
hundreds of families and

01:39.132 --> 01:44.271
survivors marked the moment
there, at Ground Zero, near the
new One World Trade Center.

01:44.271 --> 01:48.976
The pain and emotions from 2001
were again visible on their
faces.

01:48.976 --> 01:54.514
WOMAN: Anthony Luparello.
Gary Frederick Lutnick.

01:54.514 --> 01:58.418
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in the
voices of relatives who read out
the names of lost loved ones,

01:58.418 --> 02:00.721
along with personal messages.

02:00.721 --> 02:05.892
MAN: I know you're looking down
smiling and shaking your head,
saying that I'm nervous,

02:05.892 --> 02:11.631
but I am. So, God bless,
son. Love you. Keep smiling.

02:11.631 --> 02:16.570
WOMAN: Dad, thank you so much
for your memories. And I really
wish you could meet your
granddaughter,

02:16.570 --> 02:20.173
because she reminds
me of you so much.

02:20.173 --> 02:28.248
HARI SREENIVASAN: Somber
ceremonies played out at the
Pentagon as well, where the Navy

02:28.248 --> 02:33.387
Brass Quintet played and a giant
American flag marked the site
where a third plane struck.

02:33.387 --> 02:37.657
Defense Secretary Ashton Carter
took aim at attackers then and
now.

02:37.657 --> 02:41.661
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: Terrorists who hope
to intimidate us will find no
satisfaction

02:41.661 --> 02:46.600
and no success in threatening
the United States.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.737
HARI SREENIVASAN: A short time
later, in Shanksville, crowds
turned out for a second day at
the

02:50.737 --> 02:55.675
new memorial to the United
flight that went down in an open
field.

02:55.675 --> 03:01.348
It was also a day for honoring
the sacrifice by U.S. forces in
Iraq and Afghanistan since

03:01.348 --> 03:09.890
9/11. President Obama met this
afternoon with soldiers at Fort
Meade, Maryland. In turn,

03:09.890 --> 03:13.693
American troops in Kabul marked
the first anniversary of the
attacks since U.S. combat

03:13.693 --> 03:33.780
operations in Afghanistan
formally ended.

03:33.780 --> 03:38.919
The flow of refugees and
migrants across Austria turned
into a mass march today.
Hundreds of

03:38.919 --> 03:43.690
people gave up waiting at the
Hungarian border, after Austrian
officials stopped running
special

03:43.690 --> 03:48.862
trains. Instead, they started
the 40-mile walk to Vienna. More
than 10,000 arrived at

03:48.862 --> 03:51.998
the border in the last 24 hours
alone, bound for Germany.

03:51.998 --> 03:56.436
And United Nations officials
appealed today for humane
treatment.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.539
WILLIAM SPINDLER, United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees:
Refugees who are coming to
Europe

03:59.539 --> 04:04.845
looking for protection who have
already suffered so much and
risked their lives to come here

04:04.845 --> 04:10.517
to find safety should be treated
in a humane way. They shouldn't
be received with police

04:10.517 --> 04:15.655
batons and with tear gas and
with barbed wire and with fences
and walls.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.659
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
video from Human Rights Watch
showed Hungarian police throwing

04:19.659 --> 04:24.798
food at crowds in a border camp.
The group said the refugees are
being treated like animals.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.001
In turn, Hungary's prime
minister, Viktor Orban, praised
police, and said they face

04:28.001 --> 04:31.304
an open rebellion.

04:31.304 --> 04:35.408
And in Brussels, European Union
diplomats worked toward a
critical Monday meeting on

04:35.408 --> 04:39.946
resettling 160,000 people. We
will take a closer look at
families making the journey

04:39.946 --> 04:43.683
to Europe after
the news summary.

04:43.683 --> 04:47.420
Disaster struck in Saudi Arabia
today when a construction crane
collapsed in Mecca. At

04:47.420 --> 04:53.026
least 87 people were killed, and
more than 180 hurt. The crane
plunged into the east

04:53.026 --> 04:57.564
side of the Grand Mosque
complex, the world's largest.
The site had been buffeted by
high

04:57.564 --> 05:03.470
winds and rain as crews prepared
for the annual Muslim pilgrimage
to Mecca.

05:03.470 --> 05:09.042
President Obama is warning
Russia that its military buildup
in Syria is bound to fail.

05:09.042 --> 05:14.381
Moscow has been sending more
troops and weapons to bolster
Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad.

05:14.381 --> 05:18.251
And the Kremlin called today for
military talks with the U.S. to
avoid -- quote -- "unintended

05:18.251 --> 05:20.687
incidents."

05:20.687 --> 05:24.691
But at Fort Meade, Virginia
(sic), the president said any
talks should have a different
goal.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.961
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We are going to
be engaging Russia to let

05:27.961 --> 05:35.969
them know that you can't
continue to double down on a
strategy that's doomed to
failure,

05:35.969 --> 05:40.640
and that if they're willing to
work with us and the 60-nation
coalition that we have put

05:40.640 --> 05:46.346
together, then there's the
possibility of a political
settlement in which Assad would

05:46.346 --> 05:49.082
be transitioned out.

05:49.082 --> 05:53.587
HARI SREENIVASAN: Russia says
its buildup is designed to
battle Islamic State forces

05:53.587 --> 05:59.092
in Syria. The U.S. has been
conducting airstrikes against
ISIS targets there for a year.

05:59.092 --> 06:03.897
House Republicans staged
symbolic votes against the
nuclear deal with Iran today.
They first

06:03.897 --> 06:09.002
rejected the agreement, then
voted to delay lifting sanctions
on Iran. But there's little

06:09.002 --> 06:13.607
chance the House actions will
matter. That's because Democrats
have blocked the Senate

06:13.607 --> 06:17.210
from rejecting the nuclear deal,
meaning no such bill will ever
reach the president's

06:17.210 --> 06:20.113
desk.

06:20.113 --> 06:25.385
Republican Rick Perry has become
the first major candidate to
drop out of the 2016
presidential

06:25.385 --> 06:28.989
race. The former Texas governor
announced his decision this
afternoon in Saint Louis.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.325
It was his second bid for the
White House, but he'd struggled
to raise funds and was

06:32.325 --> 06:35.862
polling near zero.

06:35.862 --> 06:42.736
In India, a judge has convicted
12 Islamist militants for the
2006 bombings in Mumbai,

06:42.736 --> 06:48.975
after a trial that lasted seven
years; 188 people were killed
and more than 800 wounded

06:48.975 --> 06:54.714
in the evening rush hour attack.
Seven bombs exploded in a span
of 10 minutes. The trial

06:54.714 --> 06:58.151
concluded a year ago, but it
took the judge a year to write
the verdict. The defendants

06:58.151 --> 07:02.088
could be sentenced
to death by hanging.

07:02.088 --> 07:06.926
The flood disaster in Japan
intensified today as more rivers
overflowed their banks. Three

07:06.926 --> 07:12.198
people have died and 23 others
are still missing since a
tropical storm touched off the
deluge.

07:12.198 --> 07:16.369
Many of the homes destroyed in
the hardest-hit areas northeast
of Tokyo are still being
inundated

07:16.369 --> 07:21.775
by muddy water. Disaster experts
assessed the devastation today.

07:21.775 --> 07:27.480
MAN (through translator): It is
worse than I had expected. The
buildings near the river

07:27.480 --> 07:31.184
are completely destroyed by the
power of the water current. I
have been to many disaster

07:31.184 --> 07:34.587
sites, but, once again, I was
reminded of the energy of water
disasters.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.490
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some parts of
Japan got more than twice the
normal amount of rainfall

07:37.490 --> 07:41.795
for all of September in the
span of just 48 hours.

07:41.795 --> 07:47.667
The government of Indonesia
promised action today to
disperse a thick, smoky haze.
Officials

07:47.667 --> 07:52.872
said they're sending more than
10,000 troops to fight fires in
Southern Sumatra. The smoke

07:52.872 --> 07:57.477
has made thousands of people
sick, and delayed flights across
the region, including in
neighboring

07:57.477 --> 08:02.382
Singapore and Malaysia. The
fires in Sumatra are set in part
to clear land for pulp companies

08:02.382 --> 08:05.185
and palm oil plantations.

08:05.185 --> 08:11.224
Cuba says it is releasing more
than 3,500 prisoners, ahead of
next week's visit by Pope

08:11.224 --> 08:16.830
Francis. They include a mix of
women, young people and the
sick, but apparently no
political

08:16.830 --> 08:19.265
prisoners. This is the third
time that Cuba's communist
government has freed inmates
ahead

08:19.265 --> 08:22.635
of a papal visit.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.139
And Wall Street closed out the
week on a positive note. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained

08:26.139 --> 08:32.679
more than 100 points to close
above 16430. The Nasdaq rose 26
points, and the S&P 500

08:32.679 --> 08:38.585
added eight. For the week, the
Dow and the S&P gained 2
percent. The Nasdaq rose 3
percent.

08:38.585 --> 08:43.857
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the many faces of another great
migration, and the

08:43.857 --> 08:48.495
U.S. decision to open its doors
to more refugees; then, the
analysis of Shields and Brooks,

08:48.495 --> 09:05.245
and much more.

09:05.245 --> 09:09.783
The numbers of people on the
move into Western Europe by
foot, by road, by rail are
staggering,

09:09.783 --> 09:13.019
and still growing.

09:13.019 --> 09:17.257
On that new and exhausting
journey, our William Brangham
met several families from all
over

09:17.257 --> 09:20.794
Syria. Tonight, he
reports from Austria.

09:20.794 --> 09:25.932
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's midday in
Budapest's Keleti train station.
Hundreds of refugees

09:25.932 --> 09:30.370
and migrants have been waiting
here for hours, waiting for
trains to Austria and then on

09:30.370 --> 09:34.040
to one of the other European
nations who have laid out the
welcome mat.

09:34.040 --> 09:39.479
The kids here, despite standing
for hours, barely able to move a
foot in any direction,

09:39.479 --> 09:43.216
seem to be taking it all in
stride. Of course, they have
been on the road too for weeks
and

09:43.216 --> 09:48.188
months, so today is nothing new.
While she's waiting, 2-year-old
Maral (ph) Diab tries

09:48.188 --> 09:53.092
to get some shut-eye on her
dad's head. Maral and her family
have traveled over 3,000 miles

09:53.092 --> 10:00.133
so far, by car, by boat,
on foot and now by train.

10:00.133 --> 10:05.939
Maral's parents, Majdoleen and
Ahmad (ph), are Palestinians.
They lived in Syria their

10:05.939 --> 10:10.677
entire lives. But after four
years of brutal civil war,
Majdoleen says staying in Syria

10:10.677 --> 10:12.946
became impossible.

10:12.946 --> 10:17.417
MAJDOLEEN DIAB, Refugee (through
translator): We planned this
trip about two months ago.

10:17.417 --> 10:23.122
We decided to leave the country
as the situation got worse and
there was no works or schools.

10:23.122 --> 10:27.961
And the area we were staying in
was not safe anymore, so we
decided to leave and then
started

10:27.961 --> 10:31.731
preparing for our trip.

10:31.731 --> 10:36.803
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Majdoleen's
husband, Ahmad, designed metal
fabrication tools back in Syria.

10:36.803 --> 10:41.107
She worked as a hairstylist and
also went to school. When they
left Syria, they traveled

10:41.107 --> 10:45.245
into Turkey and then crossed the
Aegean Sea to Greece in a boat.
From there, they went

10:45.245 --> 10:51.918
to Macedonia, Serbia and up into
Hungary, where we met them.

10:51.918 --> 10:56.389
As mom and dad tried to sleep,
their first sleep in a couple
days, little Maral seems

10:56.389 --> 11:01.160
anything but tired. While the
rest of the train is passed out,
she is a bundle of energy,

11:01.160 --> 11:03.963
playing in the crowded aisles
and chucking her little purple
dinosaur at me so often,

11:03.963 --> 11:08.535
I had to play along.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.304
It's hard to know what this
2-year-old makes of all the
upheaval in her life.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.541
Do you think she understands
what's going on?

11:14.541 --> 11:17.277
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: No.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.013
(LAUGHTER)

11:20.013 --> 11:23.917
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do you
think she thinks is happening
with all of this travel and
trips

11:23.917 --> 11:27.086
and boats and...

11:27.086 --> 11:34.727
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: She think the
journey is bye-bye-bye. But she
doesn't know anything.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.864
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
it's better that way, that she
doesn't know?

11:37.864 --> 11:42.035
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: I don't know.

11:42.035 --> 11:50.009
MAN: They play. They don't know.
Always be happy, because we not
let them to feel scared.

11:50.009 --> 11:54.814
Ever we scared, but we not
let them to feel scared.

11:54.814 --> 11:58.952
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thirty-five
miles north, Hamid Yakti (ph) is
also a Syrian refugee

11:58.952 --> 12:03.756
who has been traveling for weeks
with his kids. His wife is Hosun
(ph) and their children

12:03.756 --> 12:08.194
are Adam (ph), who is 3, and
Fatin (ph), who is 4. Hamid says
they have tried to shelter

12:08.194 --> 12:12.098
the kids from the violence back
home, but it hasn't worked.

12:12.098 --> 12:17.103
MAN: I travel for my kids,
because when the bombs coming
near our house, only this -- my

12:17.103 --> 12:20.440
daughter, she's too much afraid.
She don't want me even I go
outside, because she afraid

12:20.440 --> 12:31.351
I will not come back. But she
know everything about the gun,
about the bombing, land -- she

12:31.351 --> 12:36.189
know everything.

12:36.189 --> 12:42.228
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back on the
train to Austria, we met another
refugee who has plenty of reason

12:42.228 --> 12:44.797
to fear for his
family's well-being.

12:44.797 --> 12:50.370
Sifan Ibrahim is a Syrian Kurd.
He proudly showed me photos of
himself in one of the

12:50.370 --> 12:55.742
Kurdish militias who fought
ISIS, or Da'esh, as many call
that group. Even though we could

12:55.742 --> 13:00.013
barely communicate with each
other he, Sifan demonstrated why
he says he fought ISIS, because

13:00.013 --> 13:02.281
they killed his mother.

13:02.281 --> 13:06.786
Your mother was
killed by Da'esh?

13:06.786 --> 13:10.390
MAN: My mother, Da'esh...

13:10.390 --> 13:17.430
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes. A suicide
bomber blow up a bomb?.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.966
MAN: My mother.

13:19.966 --> 13:24.303
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm sorry.

13:24.303 --> 13:28.941
Several hours and another train
ride later, the Diab family is
told they have got a two-mile

13:28.941 --> 13:32.679
walk to the Austrian border to a
bus station, where they can
transfer to Vienna. Maral
quickly

13:32.679 --> 13:38.317
retakes her position on
her dad's shoulders.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.921
Majdoleen says they hope to end
up in Germany. They have heard
from friends that it's the

13:41.921 --> 13:44.624
best place, somewhere they can
recreate the life they had
before all hell broke loose

13:44.624 --> 13:45.858
in Syria.

13:45.858 --> 13:49.328
Before the war, was life good?

13:49.328 --> 13:55.101
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: Yes, beautiful,
and just good. It was beautiful.

13:55.101 --> 13:59.305
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And your
husband was working and you were
raising your daughter.

13:59.305 --> 14:04.711
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: I'm working and
my husband's working. And I
said, everything -- and we

14:04.711 --> 14:13.152
-- we can't live this. We
won't live in our house.

14:13.152 --> 14:17.223
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Yakti
family also wants to go to
Germany. They have already got
children's

14:17.223 --> 14:20.893
books written in German so their
kids can learn the language.

14:20.893 --> 14:24.030
Hamid says he knows this isn't
the right way to move to another
country, but he says they

14:24.030 --> 14:26.966
had no choice.

14:26.966 --> 14:32.405
MAN: I understand the situation,
but we are sorry. Our situation,
like, we come, we run

14:32.405 --> 14:46.919
from the death. This is a dead
journey. This is what I call it,
and everybody knows. The

14:46.919 --> 14:50.189
children is -- too much hard for
the children, this journey.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.692
MAJDOLEEN DIAB:
Future, our future.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.594
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her future.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.363
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: Yes.

14:57.363 --> 15:01.868
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we're
talking, a horn sounds for the
buses. Everybody scrambles

15:01.868 --> 15:06.305
to pick up their belongings and
get out the door and into the
lines.

15:06.305 --> 15:11.477
The crowds build up fast. People
start pressing in. And then
everything seems to stop. The

15:11.477 --> 15:17.550
buses are very slow-coming. As
the sun goes down, people get
impatient and mad. Hundreds

15:17.550 --> 15:21.487
are pushing and
shoving from behind.

15:21.487 --> 15:28.461
With Maral hanging on his
shoulders, Ahmad lashes out.
Over an hour, it's gotten to be

15:28.461 --> 15:33.266
too much for them. Even though
they were so close to the front,
they decide to give up

15:33.266 --> 15:38.404
and go back inside. They will
sleep tonight on the concrete
floor of this huge warehouse,

15:38.404 --> 15:40.840
their trip north held up for
another night at least. They
will try to make it to Vienna

15:40.840 --> 15:45.378
again tomorrow.

15:45.378 --> 15:55.354
MAJDOLEEN DIAB: I want to sleep
now. And we wait. We wait. What
happened now? I haven't

15:55.354 --> 15:57.089
an idea. But we wait. We
haven't another choice now.

15:57.089 --> 16:01.260
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm William Brangham
in Nickelsdorf, Austria.

16:01.260 --> 16:06.365
HARI SREENIVASAN: For some
refugees, the United States will
be the final stop on that
exhausting

16:06.365 --> 16:09.702
journey. Yesterday, the White
House announced that 10,000
Syrians will be resettled in the

16:09.702 --> 16:12.438
U.S. over the next year.

16:12.438 --> 16:17.410
For more on how those 10,000
will be screened and selected,
I'm joined by Daryl Grisgraber,

16:17.410 --> 16:20.947
senior advocate for the Middle
East at Refugees International,
and Juan Zarate, former deputy

16:20.947 --> 16:23.115
national security adviser
for combating terrorism.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.418
So, Daryl, let me
start with you.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.422
How does a refugee get from some
of those scenes that we have
seen in this program and

16:29.422 --> 16:32.625
so many others to a
country like the U.S.?

16:32.625 --> 16:33.860
DARYL GRISGRABER, Refugees
International: Yes, it's a
fairly complicated process with

16:33.860 --> 16:36.362
quite a lot of steps.

16:36.362 --> 16:40.233
When a person first -- for
example, if we use Syrians as an
example -- flee Syria, goes

16:40.233 --> 16:45.404
to say, Jordan, in Jordan, they
register with the United
Nations, specifically the United

16:45.404 --> 16:50.509
Nations Refugee Agency. The
United Nations will then do an
interview, get a lot of
biographical

16:50.509 --> 16:55.214
information, history, family
members, that sort of thing, and
try to decide if that person's

16:55.214 --> 17:00.052
eligible for resettlement and if
that's the appropriate tool to
protect that person.

17:00.052 --> 17:03.589
Not everybody gets resettled.
It's quite a small number. And
then from there, the U.N.

17:03.589 --> 17:08.294
will make referrals to various
countries that accept refugees,
for example, the United States.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.697
And the United States then goes
another huge process of vetting
those people to make sure

17:11.697 --> 17:14.734
it's OK to let
them into the U.S.

17:14.734 --> 17:19.438
It takes about two years on
average, sometimes longer. So
it's quite a slow process, yes.

17:19.438 --> 17:24.911
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how do you
do that for 10,000, 100,000 or
whatever the final number

17:24.911 --> 17:27.546
is, whichever the countries
are that are accepting them?

17:27.546 --> 17:28.848
JUAN ZARATE, Senior Adviser,
Center for Strategic and
International Studies: Well,
keep in mind,

17:28.848 --> 17:32.251
last year, we settled only
1,500. And now we're talking
about 10,000. It's an
exponential

17:32.251 --> 17:34.887
increase in the numbers.

17:34.887 --> 17:40.593
And in terms of screening for
security purposes, as Daryl
indicated, you have an entire
additional

17:40.593 --> 17:45.665
process in the U.S. context,
where refugees receive the
highest level of security check

17:45.665 --> 17:49.335
of anyone traveling to the U.S.,
and in that context, the Syrian
refugees, the highest

17:49.335 --> 17:52.104
level of scrutiny.

17:52.104 --> 17:56.776
And so that is biometric data
that's checked, biographic data
that's checked, interviews

17:56.776 --> 18:01.113
from the Department of Homeland
Security, the intelligence
community looking at whatever

18:01.113 --> 18:04.951
information they have around
that individual, their family,
their networks, to determine

18:04.951 --> 18:08.688
whether or not there's a
security risk in that person
resettling to the U.S.

18:08.688 --> 18:13.693
So that is time-intensive. And
in the context of Syria, where
the U.S. hasn't had the benefit

18:13.693 --> 18:18.664
of being on the ground, like it
was in Iraq or Afghanistan, you
don't have a lot of information.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.968
And so we're grasping in the
dark to determine what the risk
is of bringing some of these

18:21.968 --> 18:24.070
people to the U.S.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.706
HARI SREENIVASAN: So what are
the agencies involved? Who pays
for all this?

18:26.706 --> 18:30.276
DARYL GRISGRABER: Well, within
the government, the State
Department is involved.

18:30.276 --> 18:34.814
U.S. CIS, Citizenship and
Immigration Services, which is
within the Department of
Homeland

18:34.814 --> 18:39.585
Security, the Office of Refugee
Resettlement, which is within
Health and Human Services,

18:39.585 --> 18:42.088
and there are a number of
voluntary agencies involved as
well. So there's some
private-public

18:42.088 --> 18:44.323
partnership once people actually
reach the United States.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.392
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

18:46.392 --> 18:51.697
I think the concern also, Juan,
is these security checks,
especially considering ISIS and
how

18:51.697 --> 18:57.636
dominant it is in Syria, what is
the likelihood of a bad actor
getting through the system?

18:57.636 --> 19:00.706
JUAN ZARATE: Well, you have
already heard the director of
national intelligence, Director

19:00.706 --> 19:06.512
Clapper, talk about the
intelligence community's
concerns about precisely that,
the fact that

19:06.512 --> 19:12.251
the Islamic State, for example,
could use refugee flows to
implant individuals, operatives,

19:12.251 --> 19:15.721
sleeper cells into
the United States.

19:15.721 --> 19:19.358
And the challenge, of course,
for the counterterrorism
community, not unlike other
challenges that

19:19.358 --> 19:23.829
they have to face, is that we're
not talking about huge numbers.
You can talk about just

19:23.829 --> 19:28.801
a handful or a dozen among that
population that you're letting
in that could be problematic,

19:28.801 --> 19:32.204
hitting soft targets and
presenting other problems.

19:32.204 --> 19:37.009
And so the intelligence
community is incredibly
conservative. As part of its
vetting process,

19:37.009 --> 19:41.647
you have the National
Counterterrorism Center and
others looking at as much data
as possible.

19:41.647 --> 19:46.018
And, frankly, at the end of the
day, it's about risk management.
How much risk are we

19:46.018 --> 19:50.189
willing to take, given what is
likely to be a lack of clear
information about who is
actually

19:50.189 --> 19:52.458
coming in?

19:52.458 --> 19:56.128
And we know terrorists in the
past have tried to use this
process. We have got a few cases

19:56.128 --> 20:02.101
in the U.S. of populations
within refugees supporting
terrorist groups. Not a lot, but

20:02.101 --> 20:06.439
the risk of just one or two is
considered high for the
intelligence community.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.075
HARI SREENIVASAN: So considering
that there's going to be this
many layers of checks and

20:09.075 --> 20:11.977
it could take this long, how do
we deal with this kind of
volume?

20:11.977 --> 20:15.314
DARYL GRISGRABER: Well, we get
it going as quickly as possible.

20:15.314 --> 20:20.286
I would say first, the 1,500
refugees that Juan mentioned is
a very small number for

20:20.286 --> 20:24.223
the U.S. addressing an emergency
situation like this. We're
talking about four million

20:24.223 --> 20:28.828
Syrians who potentially need
protection. Not all of them will
be resettled, only a small

20:28.828 --> 20:33.766
number. But it's important to
get the flow of the process
going as quickly as possible,

20:33.766 --> 20:38.170
because the security checks in
particular take quite a long
time, as you know.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.640
And sometimes it has to be done
more than once. Sometimes,
medical checks or security

20:41.640 --> 20:46.078
clearance have expired while
another process is going on. So,
there's a lot of stopping

20:46.078 --> 20:50.382
and restarting in many cases.
And so all of this needs to be
addressed as quickly as
possible,

20:50.382 --> 20:53.452
so really dedicating the
financial resources and machine
power to it will make a lot of

20:53.452 --> 20:55.254
difference.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.123
HARI SREENIVASAN: And during
this time, these people are not
in the United States. They're

20:57.123 --> 20:59.125
in that sort of first country
where they registered.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.994
DARYL GRISGRABER: Yes. Yes. No,
they stay in that country.

21:01.994 --> 21:05.898
And, remember, resettlement is a
protection tool. They're --
people are chosen for settlement

21:05.898 --> 21:09.835
because they're vulnerable and
need to be relocated for their
own safety. But with how

21:09.835 --> 21:13.305
slow the process is, sometimes,
they will stay in that
vulnerable situation for a
couple

21:13.305 --> 21:16.542
of years at a time until the
resettlement process is done.

21:16.542 --> 21:22.548
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so what
about the increased threat level
when -- I guess it depends on

21:22.548 --> 21:25.918
how they're received in these
different communities, even in
the place where they're waiting
or

21:25.918 --> 21:28.521
in the country where
they finally get to.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.991
JUAN ZARATE: It's a great point,
because this in some ways is the
perfect storm of both

21:31.991 --> 21:35.828
a humanitarian crises, but also
security crisis short and long
term.

21:35.828 --> 21:39.932
The short term is what we talked
about, which is the Islamic
State taking advantage, putting

21:39.932 --> 21:45.938
sleeper cells in, et cetera,
maybe not a high likelihood, but
perhaps high consequence.

21:45.938 --> 21:51.810
But you also do have the
challenge of displaced
communities and populations
being radicalized,

21:51.810 --> 21:59.518
falling prey to the lure of the
ideology that has brought others
to the forces of the Islamic

21:59.518 --> 22:04.156
State, and a real challenge, I
think, for all of the receiving
countries to make sure

22:04.156 --> 22:10.529
that there's welcoming
environment, resources and an
ability to integrate as well as
possible

22:10.529 --> 22:15.534
these populations, because one
of the things we have seen in
counterterrorism is one factor,

22:15.534 --> 22:19.004
not the only, but one factor
that leads to radicalization,
that leads to individuals

22:19.004 --> 22:23.576
going to fight abroad is not
being integrated, not finding a
way into the society in which

22:23.576 --> 22:25.711
they have moved.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.380
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Juan Zarate, Daryl Grisgraber,
thanks so much.

22:28.380 --> 22:32.218
DARYL GRISGRABER: Thank you.

22:32.218 --> 22:36.355
JUAN ZARATE: Thank you.

22:36.355 --> 22:42.428
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

22:42.428 --> 22:47.466
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
looking back at the creations of
a towering architect;

22:47.466 --> 22:54.039
and it's an upset, Serena
Williams' quest for tennis'
grand slam is dashed; Joe Biden

22:54.039 --> 22:58.210
grapples with a possible
presidential bid; the field is
set for next week's Republican

22:58.210 --> 23:03.148
debate; and is the Iran
nuclear deal a done deal?

23:03.148 --> 23:05.918
But first to the analysis of
Mark Shields and David Brooks.
That's syndicated columnist

23:05.918 --> 23:09.121
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

23:09.121 --> 23:14.927
We just had a segment where we
laid out in painful detail how
difficult it is for a refugee

23:14.927 --> 23:19.198
to gain asylum in the United
States. And there are several
people who say, you know what?

23:19.198 --> 23:25.004
If it wasn't for the United
States' foreign policy of
perhaps disbanding the Iraqi
army,

23:25.004 --> 23:31.844
creating a tremendous amount of
regional instability that
perhaps in -- fueled ISIS,
destabilized

23:31.844 --> 23:38.350
Syria further, and has caused
this migrant crises -- is the
United States responsible

23:38.350 --> 23:41.320
or should they be more
responsible in taking more
asylum seekers?

23:41.320 --> 23:44.089
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I would
be one of those people.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.726
I think all the things you
mentioned. And then a couple
years ago, we had a big debate

23:47.726 --> 23:51.730
about Syria and whether we
should be helping the moderates,
the moderates, such as they

23:51.730 --> 23:53.599
are, in Syria and whether we
should arm those moderates. And
people like John McCain and

23:53.599 --> 23:56.268
Lindsey Graham said yes.

23:56.268 --> 24:00.973
Eventually, the current
administration did arm them, but
with very little, much too late.

24:00.973 --> 24:06.578
And so you have this war between
Assad's forces and ISIS. And so
I do think it was partially

24:06.578 --> 24:11.383
our -- the vacuum created by the
U.S. and the West, when there
was still some sort of

24:11.383 --> 24:13.686
moderate solution possible, that
helped create this crisis. And,
therefore, we have a
responsibility

24:13.686 --> 24:16.121
to take in more refugees.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.892
It's still, though, bizarre to
me that most of the debate is on
this side of the pipeline,

24:19.892 --> 24:23.729
the flow of people on the
receiving end. There are
hundreds of millions -- not
hundreds,

24:23.729 --> 24:27.232
but there are a lot of --
millions of people in Syria. Are
they all going to come? What

24:27.232 --> 24:31.837
about dealing with that Syria
there and creating safe havens,
creating places where people

24:31.837 --> 24:35.908
can go to be safe, when you can
have islands of stability inside
these two evil forces?

24:35.908 --> 24:39.545
MARK SHIELDS: I agree 100
percent with 50 percent of what
David said.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.580
(LAUGHTER)

24:41.580 --> 24:47.653
MARK SHIELDS: I think that it
didn't begin with the United
States' withdrawal from Iraq.

24:47.653 --> 24:51.757
It began with the United States'
invasion of Iraq and the entire
destabilization of

24:51.757 --> 24:54.426
the region.

24:54.426 --> 24:59.832
And there's no question that
Iran was strengthened by the
United States' invasion of Iraq,
that

24:59.832 --> 25:09.108
sectarian violence was
encouraged and that --
destabilization. As far as our
-- the United

25:09.108 --> 25:13.946
States' commitment to Syria,
it's certainly been halting. But
that part of that halting

25:13.946 --> 25:20.285
has been lack of any domestic
political support, as a
consequence of what happened in
Iraq.

25:20.285 --> 25:26.258
And it was just an unmitigated
disaster. But the reality is
that the moral leadership of

25:26.258 --> 25:32.297
the planet, or at least of the
Western world right now, has
become in Berlin and Stockholm.

25:32.297 --> 25:35.634
Germany and Sweden have stepped
up. And people say, oh, well,
that is in the self-interest

25:35.634 --> 25:37.903
of Germany.

25:37.903 --> 25:43.208
It is in the self-interest of
Germany to take talented,
energetic, able, committed
people

25:43.208 --> 25:49.181
who have the resources, the
initiative and the strength to
get out. It's a tragedy. David

25:49.181 --> 25:55.754
makes the point that a nation
the size of Syria, four million
people have left the country.

25:55.754 --> 26:00.325
I mean, that's a stain on us and
it's a stain on all of the
civilized world that we have

26:00.325 --> 26:01.894
allowed that to continue.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.897
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
let's take a look at the Iran
deal.

26:04.897 --> 26:10.068
There were kind of machinations
in both sides of Congress this
week, one side saying, hey,

26:10.068 --> 26:14.673
there's this opportunity for you
to pass this up or down, the
other one saying, how about

26:14.673 --> 26:17.209
you block, that it not
pass this forward?

26:17.209 --> 26:22.047
It was just one of those moments
where you realize what are you
really voting for and

26:22.047 --> 26:25.951
how often is this going to come
up? Is this going to become like
the Affordable Care Act,

26:25.951 --> 26:30.489
where Republicans will continue
to try to figure out ways to
stop any progress on it?

26:30.489 --> 26:32.658
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

26:32.658 --> 26:36.995
It's, first of all, bizarre that
you pass something with a
minority, especially what

26:36.995 --> 26:41.099
is effectively a treaty with a
minority. Treaties are supposed
to be ratified by two-thirds,

26:41.099 --> 26:44.603
but now we have got like 42 or
whatever it was. But that's the
way the situation was

26:44.603 --> 26:46.638
set up.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.608
And once the Republicans agreed
that they only -- the Obama --
the administration only

26:49.608 --> 26:52.010
needed a third of the votes in
the Senate to pass the thing,
then it was going to be

26:52.010 --> 26:55.147
a done deal. He was
going to get a third.

26:55.147 --> 27:02.154
And so they got that and a
little more. And so the
Republicans are going to hang
whatever

27:02.154 --> 27:08.961
happens in the Middle East on
this treaty, and not only
whether Iran gets a nuclear
option

27:08.961 --> 27:11.997
or whether they begin to cheat
or fudge with the inspectors,
but the most immediate effect

27:11.997 --> 27:16.902
and whether it postpones an Iran
nuclear program, yes, it
probably does.

27:16.902 --> 27:20.472
But there's an immediate
negative effect and that is
you're enriching a power that
funds

27:20.472 --> 27:27.946
Hezbollah. And so as, for
example, Syria deteriorates and
if Hezbollah gets stronger, then
the Iranian

27:27.946 --> 27:30.749
regime will probably be funding
it more and more and that will
be a knock-off of this

27:30.749 --> 27:34.353
deal. And so the Republicans
will be able to use that.

27:34.353 --> 27:37.589
I think there's a legitimate
argument against something the
administration did that, at

27:37.589 --> 27:41.193
least in the short term,
destabilized the Middle East.

27:41.193 --> 27:48.934
MARK SHIELDS: Iran was two to
three months away from nuclear
capability.

27:48.934 --> 27:55.307
That's the best estimate of
people that I pay attention to
who are in a position of

27:55.307 --> 28:03.849
leadership. And the reality is
now that they are now at least
10 years away. Their own

28:03.849 --> 28:12.524
capacity at Arak will in
fact be decommissioned.

28:12.524 --> 28:23.402
But the politics here are
entirely different. David's
right, in the legislative office
area,

28:23.402 --> 28:28.473
you can never get in trouble by
voting against something that
passes. You can say, well,

28:28.473 --> 28:33.245
I was going to make it better.
Or voting for something that
doesn't pass, the same thing,

28:33.245 --> 28:35.480
because there's no
responsibility.

28:35.480 --> 28:42.254
This was a mirror vote of the
Iraqi war vote. Ever since that
vote, people who voted against

28:42.254 --> 28:47.025
it said we were right, and the
people who voted for it and
supported that war have been

28:47.025 --> 28:53.298
on the defensive. And Lindsey
Graham was very blunt. He said,
it's all the Democrats' now.

28:53.298 --> 28:59.137
It's theirs. And it's everything
that happens, the whole deal.

28:59.137 --> 29:05.811
I happen to think it's a good
step. It's a positive step. I
agree with Prime Minister

29:05.811 --> 29:12.351
Cameron. I agree with Chancellor
Merkel and President Hollande
that this is the best step.

29:12.351 --> 29:16.888
These are nations that know war
from their own people's
experience on their own home

29:16.888 --> 29:19.424
fronts.

29:19.424 --> 29:29.034
So I do think the reality
politically here is that what
had been bipartisan overwhelming

29:29.034 --> 29:35.807
support for Israel has been
politicized, and I think
basically by Prime Minister
Netanyahu,

29:35.807 --> 29:42.014
who endorsed Mitt Romney in
2012, and who, as a campaign
event and stunt for himself,

29:42.014 --> 29:46.184
wrangled an invitation from the
Republican Congress to come and
speak to the Congress

29:46.184 --> 29:50.455
and use it as a campaign post
basically to criticize the
policy of the president of the

29:50.455 --> 29:53.058
United States.

29:53.058 --> 29:59.331
And I think that there's been a
wedge now between what had been
overwhelming bipartisan

29:59.331 --> 30:04.136
support for Israel, and I think
quite frankly the responsibility
lies with Mr. Netanyahu.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.372
DAVID BROOKS: I agree
with that last point.

30:07.372 --> 30:12.010
But on the Iran deal, if we
conceded that Iran was going to
get a nuclear weapon, that

30:12.010 --> 30:16.081
there was no way we could stop
them, then maybe this was a good
treaty to sign. I don't

30:16.081 --> 30:18.583
think it was important
necessarily to concede that. I
don't think it was inevitable. I
think

30:18.583 --> 30:21.653
we sort of conceded a defeat
basically too early, when the
sanctions could have avoided

30:21.653 --> 30:23.388
that defeat.

30:23.388 --> 30:27.993
But the larger issue here with
both the Syrian and the Iranian
thing is sometimes when you

30:27.993 --> 30:31.930
lean in and do something, you
get blamed for it, the Iraq war.
Sometimes, when you lean

30:31.930 --> 30:36.034
out and don't do anything, you
get blamed for it, Syria.

30:36.034 --> 30:41.673
And so you got to have a foreign
policy that is very tied to the
circumstance at hand.

30:41.673 --> 30:46.545
Is this a smart move in this
particular space? My problem, in
retrospect, with the Bush
administration,

30:46.545 --> 30:48.213
they were like leaning in all
the time. My problem with the
Obama administration is they're

30:48.213 --> 30:51.116
leaning out all the time.

30:51.116 --> 30:54.219
And so neither are that
context-specific. And I think
that's just a lesson we have
learned

30:54.219 --> 30:56.121
from the last two
administrations.

30:56.121 --> 31:01.393
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
shifting gears now to Vice
President Biden.

31:01.393 --> 31:06.698
On Monday, he seemed to make, on
Labor Day, almost a campaign
rally-like speech. And then

31:06.698 --> 31:09.501
he had an appearance on "The
Late Show With Stephen Colbert"
last night. Let's play a

31:09.501 --> 31:11.103
clip.

31:11.103 --> 31:15.574
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States: I don't think
any man or woman should

31:15.574 --> 31:23.381
run for president unless, number
one, they know exactly why they
would want to be president,

31:23.381 --> 31:28.987
and, two, they can look at the
folks out there and say, I
promise you, you have my whole

31:28.987 --> 31:34.259
heart, my whole soul, my energy
and my passion to do this.

31:34.259 --> 31:42.434
And I would be lying if I
said that I knew I was there.

31:42.434 --> 31:47.706
HARI SREENIVASAN: The cynical
side of folks says, you know
what? This is a politician.

31:47.706 --> 31:51.343
He's got a great opportunity
here. And there's the other side
that he's in the midst of
incalculable

31:51.343 --> 31:53.245
grief.

31:53.245 --> 31:59.951
MARK SHIELDS: In this campaign
in 2016, Joe Biden's greatest
weakness -- that is, he talks,

31:59.951 --> 32:05.490
he says what he thinks off the
cuff, he is unfiltered -- is his
greatest strength.

32:05.490 --> 32:12.264
I urge, which I have never done
before on this broadcast,
everybody to watch that
exchange,

32:12.264 --> 32:16.902
that interview with Stephen
Colbert. Stephen Colbert in my
judgment proved himself to be

32:16.902 --> 32:22.607
a national resource last night.
I was, like, eavesdropping on a
very intimate personal

32:22.607 --> 32:29.714
conversation between two people
on subjects of great and intense
importance to them emotionally.

32:29.714 --> 32:38.456
I just thought it was
phenomenal, in the sense that he
was just as open, as emotionally
accessible,

32:38.456 --> 32:46.064
however you want to put it. I
mean, it was a great strength of
his, what has been sort

32:46.064 --> 32:51.236
of Joe tells you and Joe tells
too much. Joe spoke last night
from the heart. And in this

32:51.236 --> 32:56.441
campaign, with positioning and
focus groups and readjusting and
all the rest of it, I

32:56.441 --> 32:59.044
got to tell you,
it was refreshing.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.345
DAVID BROOKS: It was a really
beautiful thing and beautiful
moment. And it reveals what

33:00.345 --> 33:02.981
a beautiful man he was.

33:02.981 --> 33:08.086
But to me, surprisingly, it
reveals that maybe he does have
an opening this year. The
newspaper

33:08.086 --> 33:12.023
earlier in the week had a story
that Hillary Clinton has a plan
to become more spontaneous.

33:12.023 --> 33:12.958
And so...

33:12.958 --> 33:13.758
MARK SHIELDS: Organized
spontaneity.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.927
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

33:15.927 --> 33:20.665
But Joe Biden is sincere down to
the bones. He's always sincere,
sometimes to a fault.

33:20.665 --> 33:24.102
But that sincerity comes
through. And that may actually
play this year. It's a little

33:24.102 --> 33:26.671
counterpolitical, in a weird
way, to be that sincere. But
that's who he is. And so that

33:26.671 --> 33:29.007
may actually work.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.510
Also, he's become more
disciplined. He used to -- when
you would go out and would cover

33:32.510 --> 33:35.747
a Joe Biden rally, he would give
a great speech, and then he
would follow with a second
speech,

33:35.747 --> 33:39.117
and a third speech and a forth
speech, and they would get
decliningly good, or bad, or

33:39.117 --> 33:41.453
whatever, decline.

33:41.453 --> 33:45.724
So, he's more disciplined by the
vice presidency. He's had to be.
And so I'm beginning to think

33:45.724 --> 33:49.961
there's an opening. And it's
just a testament to two men who
had severe losses in their

33:49.961 --> 33:52.264
lives in conversation.

33:52.264 --> 33:56.968
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, finally,
the debates, the platforms are
set for next week. Carly

33:56.968 --> 34:04.009
Fiorina moves up to the -- kind
of the marquee event, and not
the warm-up show.

34:04.009 --> 34:07.812
But somebody's dropping out. We
talked about Rick Perry today. I
want to just pull a quote

34:07.812 --> 34:12.284
out of his concession speech --
or his departure speech.
"Demeaning people of Hispanic
heritage

34:12.284 --> 34:16.988
is not just ignorant. It betrays
the example of Christ."

34:16.988 --> 34:21.026
And I think he's referring
specifically to Donald Trump
here. And he goes on: "It's time

34:21.026 --> 34:24.429
to elevate our debate from
divisive name-calling, from
sound bites without solutions."

34:24.429 --> 34:27.432
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

34:27.432 --> 34:31.670
There's no question he's talking
about Donald Trump there. We
have had harsh words back

34:31.670 --> 34:38.276
and forth between the two men.
But Rick Perry spent the last
two years preparing for this

34:38.276 --> 34:43.281
race. But it comes down to,
sadly, you don't -- very rarely
get a second chance to make

34:43.281 --> 34:47.185
a first impression. And oops in
the three department he was
going to abolish dogged

34:47.185 --> 34:50.488
him. And that's the reason.

34:50.488 --> 34:53.925
But on the way out, he certainly
gave Mr. Trump a salute.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.895
DAVID BROOKS: He ran a much
better campaign this time, a
good speech on
African-Americans,

34:56.895 --> 35:02.500
a good speech on Hispanics, much
better campaign, worse outcome.
It's too bad.

35:02.500 --> 35:06.237
On the debates, I think Jeb
Bush, this is a debate where
he's got to -- he's leaking

35:06.237 --> 35:08.974
air. And so I think the
pressure's on him more than
anybody else in this debate.

35:08.974 --> 35:12.310
MARK SHIELDS: I agree.
I would say this.

35:12.310 --> 35:17.182
Everybody knew Donald Trump in
the fourth grade, I mean, the
bully. And if you correct

35:17.182 --> 35:21.987
him or criticize him in any way,
you're stupid or you're dumb, or
you're ugly. That is what

35:21.987 --> 35:26.358
he accused Carly Fiorina
of being this week.

35:26.358 --> 35:33.365
And I think he may have stepped
one step beyond. If Carly
Fiorina is disqualified because
of

35:33.365 --> 35:38.470
her looks, what does that mean
Donald Trump would say about
Golda Meir or Angela Merkel

35:38.470 --> 35:44.109
or Mother Teresa? It just tells
you something about the depth of
the man.

35:44.109 --> 35:49.614
And I think that it's really
going to be determined. Rubio
and Kasich have hidden from him.
Cruz

35:49.614 --> 35:54.819
has tried to be his best buddy,
his closest friend. Scott Walker
tried to emulate him

35:54.819 --> 35:59.924
and fell flat on his face. Jeb
Bush has decided he is going to
take on the bully. And I think

35:59.924 --> 36:03.561
Chris Christie will throw a
haymaker on the way out.

36:03.561 --> 36:07.365
It's going to be -- it's not
going to be ballroom dancing.
It's going to be a slugfest.

36:07.365 --> 36:21.646
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thanks so much.

36:21.646 --> 36:25.817
Now for an iconic architect with
an inventive style, whose
buildings almost seem to move,

36:25.817 --> 36:30.688
and are known for sweeping
curves and unusual materials.

36:30.688 --> 36:34.793
Jeffrey Brown catches up with
Frank Gehry, now in his ninth
decade, but still breaking

36:34.793 --> 36:39.431
new ground. An exhibition all
about his work is opening in Los
Angeles this weekend.

36:39.431 --> 36:43.701
FRANK GEHRY, Architect: This
is City Hall, New York.

36:43.701 --> 36:50.341
JEFFREY BROWN: A visit to the
studio of Frank Gehry is a bit
like a whirlwind tour of the

36:50.341 --> 36:53.845
globe, with a tour guide who has
helped create what we see around
us.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.947
You got cities all
over the world here.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.383
FRANK GEHRY: That's
Toronto, where I was born.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.386
JEFFREY BROWN: Part of his
motivation, says Gehry, is that
so many buildings are just

37:01.386 --> 37:03.555
plain boring.

37:03.555 --> 37:09.327
FRANK GEHRY: Anybody I talk to
agrees that maybe 2 percent of
the building environment

37:09.327 --> 37:12.497
since the war, we could
call architecture.

37:12.497 --> 37:14.165
JEFFREY BROWN: And the rest
you call nothing, junk?

37:14.165 --> 37:16.634
FRANK GEHRY: It's built.

37:16.634 --> 37:23.141
JEFFREY BROWN: And so Gehry, now
86, builds, but adds in more
than a bit of flair, dash,

37:23.141 --> 37:28.780
you could call it art, as with
his 2014 Louis Vuitton
Foundation Building in Paris,
wrapped

37:28.780 --> 37:31.616
in sails of swirling glass.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.853
Are you better at this than
you were as a young man?

37:34.853 --> 37:40.658
FRANK GEHRY: Probably a little
bit more secure about it,
although there is a sort of
healthy

37:40.658 --> 37:45.597
insecurity that I think is
necessary. If you think you got
everything, forget it.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.399
JEFFREY BROWN: Gehry has been
the world's most famous
architect since he graded the

37:48.399 --> 37:53.938
Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao, Spain, in 1997.

37:53.938 --> 37:59.010
And there have been plenty other
eye-catching buildings, the
Dancing House in Prague, the

37:59.010 --> 38:02.046
Olympic Fish in Barcelona
and many more.

38:02.046 --> 38:05.783
FRANK GEHRY: It was working
with very inexpensive material.

38:05.783 --> 38:10.889
JEFFREY BROWN: It actually
started, though, at home, his
own home in Santa Monica, where

38:10.889 --> 38:18.062
Gehry still lives, a 1920s
bungalow that he reimagined
using corrugated metal and
chain-link

38:18.062 --> 38:23.635
fence, unusual building
materials, but elements of his
future work all there.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.338
FRANK GEHRY: I found the
material that people hated the
most and used the most. So, I
was

38:27.338 --> 38:31.476
going and try and see if I could
play with it sculpturally.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.779
STEPHANIE BARRON, Curator, Los
Angeles County Museum of Art: I
see an amazing thinker. I

38:34.779 --> 38:39.217
see a humanist, a thinker,
somebody who is really sensitive
to what buildings do and

38:39.217 --> 38:42.921
how people interact in them.

38:42.921 --> 38:48.560
JEFFREY BROWN: Now Gehry is
being honored in his longtime
home town with a retrospective

38:48.560 --> 38:53.598
exhibition curated by Stephanie
Barron at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. We visited

38:53.598 --> 38:55.967
during the installation.

38:55.967 --> 39:02.173
Here are the drawings,
photographs and, most of all,
models of myriad projects.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.777
STEPHANIE BARRON: This is one of
the models for the Lewis
Residence.

39:05.777 --> 39:10.448
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the most
important, Barron says, started
out as a small addition

39:10.448 --> 39:15.386
to the home of Peter Lewis. It
was never built, but turned into
a fantastical playground of

39:15.386 --> 39:19.090
ideas that Gehry
would later develop.

39:19.090 --> 39:26.097
STEPHANIE BARRON: Look at the
roof, for instance. It drapes
the building, and it's like
fabric

39:26.097 --> 39:35.006
that has been moistened and then
carefully kind of connects it.
It becomes the connector.

39:35.006 --> 39:42.981
On the far side, you see very
kind of constructivist, very
rectilinear, kind of simple
geometric

39:42.981 --> 39:47.151
forms, and it brings together
styles and ideas. And I think
this is the project where he
began

39:47.151 --> 39:53.524
to see what the computer
technology could do.

39:53.524 --> 39:58.630
JEFFREY BROWN: The computer
system, called CATIA, was based
on an aerospace program.

39:58.630 --> 40:03.635
It became key to Gehry's
practice, allowing his team to
work out its elaborate designs

40:03.635 --> 40:06.804
and giving contractors a
map for fabricating them.

40:06.804 --> 40:09.274
TENSHO TAKEMORI, Designer: As a
designer, we can clearly
understand where we need to

40:09.274 --> 40:11.009
focus.

40:11.009 --> 40:15.913
JEFFREY BROWN: Tensho Takemori
and Sameer Kashyap showed us the
program used to develop

40:15.913 --> 40:22.720
the bumpy facade, or curtain, of
a recent 76-story New York
apartment building.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.391
Having the computer work out the
technical specs reduced the time
and cost for the contractors

40:26.391 --> 40:28.593
to build it.

40:28.593 --> 40:32.330
TENSHO TAKEMORI: If you were to
do this by hand, you might get
two or three tries within

40:32.330 --> 40:38.603
the allowable design period. We
had thousands of iterations. And
because of that, we were

40:38.603 --> 40:43.908
actually able to hone the thing
down to such great efficiency
that we could essentially

40:43.908 --> 40:47.679
reduce the cost to almost the
same as a flat curtain wall.

40:47.679 --> 40:53.685
The proof in this is there were
no change orders, and that's a
pretty unheard-of result

40:53.685 --> 40:55.119
for a 76-story tower.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.522
FRANK GEHRY: It's
like an old friend.

40:57.522 --> 41:00.158
JEFFREY BROWN: The computer
program helped Gehry build what
is certainly one of his most

41:00.158 --> 41:02.627
iconic works.

41:02.627 --> 41:09.834
FRANK GEHRY: I was trying to
express movement with the shape
of these walls, and juxtaposing

41:09.834 --> 41:13.705
two walls that are both moving.

41:13.705 --> 41:19.077
JEFFREY BROWN: Disney Hall in
downtown Los Angeles opened in
2003 and quickly became

41:19.077 --> 41:24.382
a landmark where tourists and
even models come to take photos
amid the sweeping stainless

41:24.382 --> 41:30.688
steel walls. The outside gets
most of the attention, but Gehry
wanted to take us inside

41:30.688 --> 41:35.426
to explain that his first
concern, as always, was a
practical one, the acoustics.

41:35.426 --> 41:40.865
FRANK GEHRY: In the concert
hall, the orchestra has to hear
each other. They play better
when

41:40.865 --> 41:47.538
they hear each other. That's A.
B is then you have to
communicate with the audience.

41:47.538 --> 41:53.111
If you connect with the
orchestra and they love it and
people like coming here, bingo,

41:53.111 --> 41:58.950
I'm happy. Everything
else is, you know, extra.

41:58.950 --> 42:03.588
JEFFREY BROWN: Gehry was so into
the audience experience, he
insisted on narrower arm rests

42:03.588 --> 42:06.224
to increase the seat sides.

42:06.224 --> 42:13.064
FRANK GEHRY: The arms usually
are thick all the way down,
which takes one inch off of

42:13.064 --> 42:20.405
the width of the seat, so people
of larger weight, so to speak,
are happier here.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.240
(LAUGHTER)

42:22.240 --> 42:26.577
JEFFREY BROWN: Frank Gehry has
at times been knocked for
creating showy buildings that

42:26.577 --> 42:31.916
overwhelm their surroundings,
for being a starchitect more
than an architect.

42:31.916 --> 42:37.655
At Disney Hall, he insisted that
function always comes first,
then the artful expression.

42:37.655 --> 42:42.026
FRANK GEHRY: They're not ego
trips in the negative sense of
an ego trip. I mean, you

42:42.026 --> 42:45.263
see a lot of so-called
architecture that part of the
ego trip overpowers the
functionality

42:45.263 --> 42:49.667
and the budget and
all that stuff.

42:49.667 --> 42:55.940
So, it's the essence. It's
finding an essence. Why be
expressive on the outside?
Because

42:55.940 --> 42:57.375
everything around isn't.

42:57.375 --> 42:58.543
JEFFREY BROWN: It's
as simple as that?

42:58.543 --> 43:00.678
FRANK GEHRY: Yes.

43:00.678 --> 43:04.081
JEFFREY BROWN: In addition to
the retrospective, Gehry is the
subject of a new biography by

43:04.081 --> 43:06.484
architecture critic
Paul Goldberger.

43:06.484 --> 43:10.221
FRANK GEHRY: The blue one is one
we did for Brad Pitt in New
Orleans.

43:10.221 --> 43:14.459
JEFFREY BROWN: Later this month,
he will receive a lifetime
achievement award from the
L.A.-based

43:14.459 --> 43:20.364
Getty Trust, and he's now
developing a master plan to
revitalize the 51-mile Los
Angeles

43:20.364 --> 43:22.200
River, sure to be controversial.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.936
Why are you still doing
this? You're 86.

43:24.936 --> 43:25.870
FRANK GEHRY: At my age?

43:25.870 --> 43:27.038
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

43:27.038 --> 43:28.072
FRANK GEHRY: I don't
know what else to do.

43:28.072 --> 43:28.539
(LAUGHTER)

43:28.539 --> 43:30.575
JEFFREY BROWN: Is that true?

43:30.575 --> 43:35.880
FRANK GEHRY: I love doing it. I
love working. I don't know what
the word vacation means.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.884
JEFFREY BROWN: All in all, it's
a major moment for Frank Gehry
in Los Angeles.

43:39.884 --> 43:41.652
FRANK GEHRY: And
that's Australia.

43:41.652 --> 43:44.589
JEFFREY BROWN: And well beyond.

43:44.589 --> 43:53.764
From L.A., I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS NewsHour."

43:53.764 --> 44:03.140
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's news
out from the National Institutes
of Health today that could

44:03.140 --> 44:08.012
change the way we deal with
blood pressure. Researchers
found that, for many patients

44:08.012 --> 44:13.284
over 50, blood pressure far
below the commonly recommended
targets can drastically reduce

44:13.284 --> 44:17.688
the risk of heart attacks,
strokes and deaths.

44:17.688 --> 44:22.193
Doctors said the top line of a
blood pressure reading should be
below 120 for many. Prior

44:22.193 --> 44:27.632
recommendations put the number
at 140. In fact, the NIH
announced the end of a major

44:27.632 --> 44:33.304
blood pressure study a year
early, saying it was potentially
lifesaving information.

44:33.304 --> 44:38.242
Dr. Gary Gibbons is director of
the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute at NIH, which

44:38.242 --> 44:40.978
sponsored the trial.
He joins us now.

44:40.978 --> 44:44.382
Dr. Gibbons, first of all, break
this down for us. Why is this
significant?

44:44.382 --> 44:46.183
DR. GARY GIBBONS, Director,
National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute: Well, as you know,

44:46.183 --> 44:51.822
Hari, 70 millions Americans
have high blood pressure.

44:51.822 --> 44:58.229
It predisposes to the leading
causes of death, such as heart
disease and stroke. And we knew

44:58.229 --> 45:03.668
for a long time that treating
high blood pressure was
important to prevent these
complications.

45:03.668 --> 45:07.271
But there was a lot of
uncertainty as to how low
doctors should go and bringing
that pressure

45:07.271 --> 45:09.574
down.

45:09.574 --> 45:15.146
The SPRINT study, Systolic Blood
Pressure Intervention Trial, was
designed to ask and

45:15.146 --> 45:21.485
answer that question. And now we
have those interim results that
make it very clear that

45:21.485 --> 45:28.359
being aggressive an intensive
treatment regimen that goes to
that lower target below 120
millimeters

45:28.359 --> 45:33.831
of mercury shows great benefit
in reducing the complications
such as heart attacks, heart

45:33.831 --> 45:37.168
failure and stroke
and saves lives.

45:37.168 --> 45:40.738
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you start
to say low blood pressure,
people are going to start

45:40.738 --> 45:45.343
becoming concerned about the
elderly, for whom low blood
pressure can lead to dizziness

45:45.343 --> 45:49.347
or fainting. How do you figure
out if 120 is right for you?

45:49.347 --> 45:54.251
DR. GARY GIBBONS: Well, as in
all things, that we must balance
the benefits against

45:54.251 --> 46:00.157
potential harms. And that's why
it's important for each patient
to consult their care provider

46:00.157 --> 46:04.095
to see what's the right
target for them.

46:04.095 --> 46:10.001
But it's important to note that
this study included individuals
50 and over, and indeed

46:10.001 --> 46:18.042
included -- one-fourth of the
study sample with age 75 or
older. So it was inclusive

46:18.042 --> 46:23.648
of the elderly. Indeed, our
preliminary analyses suggest
that the benefit, we're seeing
across

46:23.648 --> 46:28.886
the diverse group of people in
the study sample, including
those over 75.

46:28.886 --> 46:33.024
So, we think that this may be
broadly applicable to those 50
and older who are at increased

46:33.024 --> 46:36.260
risk of cardiovascular disease.

46:36.260 --> 46:39.563
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just a couple
of years ago, it seemed that the
guidelines went in the

46:39.563 --> 46:43.934
opposite direction, taking the
number from 140 up to 150, and
now we're bringing it back

46:43.934 --> 46:47.304
down again. What is to say in a
couple of years this number or
this target doesn't change?

46:47.304 --> 46:50.841
DR. GARY GIBBONS: Well, as you
point out, there was some
element of debate about what

46:50.841 --> 46:53.878
the right target should be.

46:53.878 --> 46:59.050
And, indeed, it's because of
that uncertainty that trials
like SPRINT were so important

46:59.050 --> 47:04.522
to conduct. And, indeed, now
that we have the data, now we
have more definitive evidence,

47:04.522 --> 47:10.461
this brings clarity to --
within that fog of uncertainty.

47:10.461 --> 47:16.333
We look forward to the
publication of the full results.
And we anticipate it will inform

47:16.333 --> 47:21.839
those organizations that develop
clinical practice guidelines
that should provide patients

47:21.839 --> 47:27.078
and their care providers with
much clearer guidance about what
the right target is. And

47:27.078 --> 47:32.817
we're confident that the
definitiveness of this study
will provide that clarity.

47:32.817 --> 47:38.255
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, a lot
of this in your studies was
brought down by medications.

47:38.255 --> 47:41.892
But if you add more drugs to the
mix, don't they have perhaps
side effects that counter

47:41.892 --> 47:43.828
what you're doing?

47:43.828 --> 47:47.932
DR. GARY GIBBONS: Well, as you
point out, it's very important,
as clinicians routinely

47:47.932 --> 47:54.371
do, to again recognize the
benefits and potential side
effects.

47:54.371 --> 47:59.977
It's important to recognize that
what this study showed is that
there was a combination

47:59.977 --> 48:05.216
of therapies to get to the
target goal of 120 that was
well-tolerated by individuals,

48:05.216 --> 48:13.424
again, across a spectrum of ages
and degrees of renal
dysfunction, kidney dysfunction,

48:13.424 --> 48:18.329
suggesting that indeed these
regimens can be done in a way
that's both safe and effective

48:18.329 --> 48:21.465
at reaching targets in a way
that saves lives and indeed,
again, prevents heart attacks

48:21.465 --> 48:23.300
and strokes.

48:23.300 --> 48:24.769
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Dr.
Gary Gibbons from the National
Institutes of Health, thanks

48:24.769 --> 48:26.971
so much for joining us.

48:26.971 --> 48:35.513
DR. GARY GIBBONS: Thank you.

48:35.513 --> 48:41.118
HARI SREENIVASAN: When Serena
Williams took to the court this
afternoon, her match was

48:41.118 --> 48:47.958
expected by many to be one more
victory on the road to a
spectacular Grand Slam triumph.

48:47.958 --> 48:52.563
Williams had won all three prior
major titles this year, the
French Open, Australian Open

48:52.563 --> 48:58.102
and Wimbledon. She defeated her
sister, Venus, in a tough match
earlier this week. But her

48:58.102 --> 49:03.240
opponent, unseated Roberta Vinci
of Italy, dashed the hopes of
the 21-time major champion

49:03.240 --> 49:06.076
in a stunning upset.

49:06.076 --> 49:10.047
Serena was going for history and
trying to become the first woman
to win a Grand Slam,

49:10.047 --> 49:16.320
all four majors in the same
season, since Steffi Graf last
did that in 1988.

49:16.320 --> 49:20.457
Christine Brennan of USA Today
and a commentator for ABC News
joins us now.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.493
We were all watching.
What happened?

49:22.493 --> 49:24.995
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
Yes, exactly. What happened?

49:24.995 --> 49:31.001
Well, Vinci happened. And one of
the biggest upsets, Hari, we
have ever seen in sports,

49:31.001 --> 49:36.407
men or women's, any sport around
the world happened, one of the
biggest. I'm not saying

49:36.407 --> 49:42.413
it's the biggest. But Buster
Douglas beat Mike Tyson in 1990.
You have had upsets in

49:42.413 --> 49:44.882
golf. Of course, people remember
the U.S. beating the Soviets in
hockey at the Olympics

49:44.882 --> 49:47.918
in 1980.

49:47.918 --> 49:52.089
I don't know where that ranks
That, to me, is always going to
be the biggest. But in

49:52.089 --> 49:56.060
terms of a story that had been
building not just for the last
week-and-a-half, almost

49:56.060 --> 50:01.065
two weeks of the U.S. Open, but
all summer, as we have been
looking at the stories of

50:01.065 --> 50:05.669
American Pharoah and Jordan
Spieth, and we have been talking
Grand Slams and Triple Crowns,

50:05.669 --> 50:10.374
and here comes Serena just
blazing the trail with the
Australian, the French,
Wimbledon.

50:10.374 --> 50:14.812
And she is at her home
tournament. Wow. No one ever saw
this coming.

50:14.812 --> 50:18.682
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why did it
happen? Did she play poorly? Did
Vinci play better?

50:18.682 --> 50:22.953
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, she ran
into someone who, in the third
set, was able to play better

50:22.953 --> 50:25.990
and stand up to Serena, and not
let Serena do what she always
does, which is come back

50:25.990 --> 50:28.225
at the end.

50:28.225 --> 50:32.696
Serena has had an emotional run
through the U.S. Open. By that,
I mean fantastic player

50:32.696 --> 50:37.768
hitting 100 miles, 200 --
120-mile-per-hour serves. But in
terms of having her emotions

50:37.768 --> 50:41.171
get -- she's a smart woman. She
gets it. We saw it with Venus,
trying to beat her sister.

50:41.171 --> 50:43.540
That's tough anyway.

50:43.540 --> 50:47.912
But this week especially, this
moment, the idea of winning a
Grand Slam, first man or

50:47.912 --> 50:52.349
woman to do it since '88, it was
weighing on her. And I think we
finally saw in that

50:52.349 --> 50:56.620
third set with the double
faults. Just those things she
needed to muster, those things

50:56.620 --> 51:00.591
she needed, to pull out that
energy and be able to do it one
last time, and she couldn't.

51:00.591 --> 51:03.027
All credit to her opponent, but
this also was Serena's loss.
There's no doubt about

51:03.027 --> 51:04.695
that.

51:04.695 --> 51:08.666
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we're
taking a long look at this
specific loss, but where is she

51:08.666 --> 51:12.636
in the pantheon of tennis
players, even besides this loss?

51:12.636 --> 51:15.572
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, I think
she's the greatest female tennis
player of all time.

51:15.572 --> 51:18.842
And, frankly, I think she's the
greatest female athlete of all
time, Serena Williams.

51:18.842 --> 51:24.548
And that doesn't change with
what happened today. I just --
with the power and the strength

51:24.548 --> 51:28.285
and the durability -- she will
be 34 in two weeks. Steffi Graf,
we thought, was old. Steffi

51:28.285 --> 51:29.420
retired at 30.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.555
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wow.

51:31.555 --> 51:35.859
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Here's Serena
playing her best tennis almost
34 years old. That is
remarkable.

51:35.859 --> 51:39.863
The toughest day in women's
sports is today, until tomorrow.
The competition is so strong.

51:39.863 --> 51:42.766
And that's why I think Serena
is the best of all time.

51:42.766 --> 51:46.437
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this is
one of the reasons, I guess,
that we like sport, because
there

51:46.437 --> 51:49.840
is this possibility that
the upset could happen.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.476
And even in the press conference
-- or I guess in the on-court
interview after, Vinci was

51:52.476 --> 51:54.144
-- you had to love her.

51:54.144 --> 51:55.779
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Yes. Oh, yes.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.881
HARI SREENIVASAN: Because she
didn't wake up thinking she was
going to win this morning.

51:57.881 --> 52:01.418
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: No. I didn't
-- she had no chance either. She
said "Sorry," like apologizing

52:01.418 --> 52:05.522
to a whole nation for
ending this storyline.

52:05.522 --> 52:10.427
The old adage is, this is why
they play the game. And this is
absolutely it. And it's

52:10.427 --> 52:14.732
-- sports is the best realty TV
showing going. It is the best
thing about -- the greatest

52:14.732 --> 52:17.901
escape we can have. And a
day like today proved it.

52:17.901 --> 52:19.737
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.
Christine Brennan, thanks so
much.

52:19.737 --> 52:28.278
CHRISTINE BRENNAN:
Hari, thank you.

52:28.278 --> 52:34.018
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
"NewsHour" online: It was once
an amusement park fixture,
roaring

52:34.018 --> 52:38.689
with the sound of screaming
passengers along the Jersey
Shore. But months after
superstorm

52:38.689 --> 52:44.194
Sandy hit, the Jet Star roller
coaster lie wasting in the
Atlantic ocean. That's where

52:44.194 --> 52:47.331
photographer Matthew Clark found
it, only, first, he had to make
his way past a barricade

52:47.331 --> 52:50.134
and a security guard.

52:50.134 --> 52:53.971
He explains his story behind the
photo. It's part of our new
series on Art Beat called

52:53.971 --> 53:00.244
Parallax, and it's on our home
page. That's PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:00.244 --> 53:03.714
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs from our PBS
colleagues.

53:03.714 --> 53:07.951
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening. Here's a
preview:

53:07.951 --> 53:15.759
GWEN IFILL: The twists and turns
of 2016, as Hillary Clinton
slides, Joe Biden deliberates,

53:15.759 --> 53:20.631
Donald Trump attacks, and the
rest of the field tries to
decide how to react. Plus,

53:20.631 --> 53:25.269
the White House scores a big
victory on the Iran deal, even
as new questions arise about

53:25.269 --> 53:30.007
how far the U.S. will go to help
relieve the migration crisis in
Europe.

53:30.007 --> 53:32.543
We will cover it all tonight
on "Washington Week" -- Hari.

53:32.543 --> 53:35.212
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Gwen.

53:35.212 --> 53:38.782
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: stopping the cycle of
incarceration for young girls

53:38.782 --> 53:41.652
in trouble.

53:41.652 --> 53:48.392
WOMAN: Everybody had an attitude
of, you're not going to make it
anyways. So, I started

53:48.392 --> 53:53.530
believing it. Back then, I was
like, I ain't got nothing to
lose. I'm going to get locked
