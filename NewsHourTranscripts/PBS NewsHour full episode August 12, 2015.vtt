WEBVTT

00:06.173 --> 00:06.640
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.542
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.542 --> 00:13.447
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: The raucous primary
campaign tightens, as Donald

00:13.447 --> 00:20.053
Trump reaches out, Jeb Bush goes
on offense, Bernie Sanders
rises, and Hillary Clinton

00:20.053 --> 00:23.190
hands over her private
e-mail server.

00:23.190 --> 00:28.562
JUDY WOODRUFF: China's currency
falls further. Wall Street is
jolted, but recovers for the

00:28.562 --> 00:33.634
day -- what a weakened yuan
means for American pocketbooks
and paychecks.

00:33.634 --> 00:38.839
GWEN IFILL: Plus, changing the
face of classical music,
nurturing talent at an early age
to

00:38.839 --> 00:43.076
train a new generation
of diverse musicians.

00:43.076 --> 00:48.048
NJERI GREVIOUS, Yale University:
When we're engaging with our
instruments, it's just us,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.550
ourselves, our instruments, our
music. And then when we're
playing with other people,

00:50.550 --> 00:53.587
it's all of that times
-- to the nth power.

00:53.587 --> 01:00.928
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:00.928 --> 01:05.766
(BREAK)

01:05.766 --> 01:16.510
JUDY WOODRUFF: Enormous
explosions tore through a
container port tonight in
Northeastern China.

01:16.510 --> 01:22.716
Officials reported at least 13
dead and up to 400 injured. It
happened in Tianjin at

01:22.716 --> 01:28.088
a warehouse for hazardous
materials, shortly before
midnight, local time. Police
said the

01:28.088 --> 01:35.295
first blast lit off a much
larger one, with the force of 21
tons of TNT. It sent a gigantic

01:35.295 --> 01:41.234
fireball into the air, and the
shockwave sent people flooding
into hospitals.

01:41.234 --> 01:47.341
GWEN IFILL: Former President
Jimmy Carter announced this
afternoon he has cancer. In

01:47.341 --> 01:51.178
a statement, he said recent
surgery showed it's spread from
his liver to other parts

01:51.178 --> 01:54.715
of his body. He said he will
begin treatment in Atlanta.

01:54.715 --> 01:59.286
In a recent interview with the
"NewsHour," the 39th president
noted that both his parents

01:59.286 --> 02:02.322
and all three siblings
died of cancer.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.792
JIMMY CARTER, Former President
of the United States: They all
smoked cigarettes. And I

02:05.792 --> 02:11.231
never have smoked a cigarette.
So, I think that may be a
triggering device to some
genetic

02:11.231 --> 02:18.672
factor. I don't know what the
background is. But the health
service of America kind of

02:18.672 --> 02:23.043
adopted me as a target for -- we
were the only family in the
world for a number of years

02:23.043 --> 02:26.413
that was known to have
pancreatic cancer deaths four --
in four members.

02:26.413 --> 02:30.751
GWEN IFILL: Former President
Carter is 90 years old.

02:30.751 --> 02:36.590
JUDY WOODRUFF: Protesters in
Arlington, Texas, say they will
keep demanding criminal charges

02:36.590 --> 02:42.362
in the police killing of
Christian Taylor. The unarmed
college football player was
killed

02:42.362 --> 02:47.768
Friday night at an auto
dealership. Last night, the
Arlington police chief fired
Officer Brad

02:47.768 --> 02:51.705
Miller, citing -- quote --
"serious concerns" about his
actions.

02:51.705 --> 02:56.543
WILL JOHNSON, Arlington, Texas,
Police Chief: These concerns,
however, are best addressed

02:56.543 --> 03:02.349
through the criminal
investigation process. However,
based on the preponderance of
the

03:02.349 --> 03:07.888
evidence available to me and the
facts revealed by the
investigative team, I have
decided

03:07.888 --> 03:11.858
to terminate Officer Miller's
employment with the Arlington
Police Department for exercising

03:11.858 --> 03:14.261
poor judgment.

03:14.261 --> 03:20.500
JUDY WOODRUFF: The chief said
it's clear from security video
that Taylor vandalized vehicles

03:20.500 --> 03:25.038
at the auto lot and drove one
into the building. But he said
that doesn't excuse the
officer's

03:25.038 --> 03:27.107
mistakes.

03:27.107 --> 03:33.713
GWEN IFILL: A new blaze added to
California's wildfire woes
today. This one is burning
across

03:33.713 --> 03:39.319
26 square miles north of San
Francisco. Gusty winds have
spread the flames, and more than

03:39.319 --> 03:43.990
1,100 firefighters are on the
fire lines. But they're not
expected to have it contained

03:43.990 --> 03:51.431
until Monday. At least 150
people had have to leave their
homes, including some who just

03:51.431 --> 03:54.301
recently had to run
from another big fire.

03:54.301 --> 03:59.873
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's not fire,
but floods in Myanmar, the worst
in decades. Officials say

03:59.873 --> 04:06.012
more than a million people are
critically affected. Nearly
4,000 were evacuated today

04:06.012 --> 04:11.785
from the stricken capital of
Chin State in the Southeast
Asian nation. Mudslides
triggered

04:11.785 --> 04:17.057
by torrential rains have
destroyed hundreds of homes in
low-lying areas since late June.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.527
More than 100 people have died.

04:20.527 --> 04:24.764
GWEN IFILL: Beleaguered
officials in Greece bolstered
security today on a holiday
island

04:24.764 --> 04:29.102
where tensions with migrants are
growing. They're fleeing war in
Syria and elsewhere,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.638
but finding little relief.

04:31.638 --> 04:35.375
Harry Smith of Independent
Television News has this report.

04:35.375 --> 04:41.014
HARRY SMITH: By night and by
day, they're coming ashore now
in the thousands. It's just

04:41.014 --> 04:45.652
a short crossing from Turkey
to the island of Kos.

04:45.652 --> 04:51.691
But the celebrations are
short-lived. The authorities
here are overwhelmed; 2,000 of

04:51.691 --> 04:60.000
the new arrivals have been
locked in a football stadium
without food, water, shade or
sanitation.

04:60.000 --> 05:04.938
They have to be registered
before they can move on. Those
with the strength to do so

05:04.938 --> 05:07.774
push to try to reach the
front of the queue.

05:07.774 --> 05:12.646
MAN: I think it's very bad, very
bad situation there. You see it
as deadly bad. They are

05:12.646 --> 05:17.951
running from the death to the
death. I don't know. We come to
a country respect human rights

05:17.951 --> 05:20.887
and don't know -- they
must respect our rights.

05:20.887 --> 05:24.858
HARRY SMITH: A team of doctors
from Medecins Sans Frontieres
said they have been struggling

05:24.858 --> 05:28.962
to treat the numbers overcome by
the heat, many of them children.

05:28.962 --> 05:35.068
MAN: By putting 2,000 people
inside an area that wasn't
prepared, meaning it had only

05:35.068 --> 05:39.673
two toilets, no access for
water. They now have just the
water -- for all the people,

05:39.673 --> 05:45.445
when -- a situation that
is really dramatic inside.

05:45.445 --> 05:50.817
HARRY SMITH: These pictures said
to have been taken today in the
Damascus suburb of Ghouta

05:50.817 --> 05:56.489
provide a sharp reminder of why
so many are so desperate to
cross the sea to Europe. The

05:56.489 --> 05:59.693
route to Greece has become the
most popular crossing since the
fighting in Libya made

05:59.693 --> 06:03.697
the trip to Italy too dangerous.

06:03.697 --> 06:08.268
But they are now arriving in a
country already struggling with
a crisis of its own. Extra

06:08.268 --> 06:12.839
riot police have been sent to
Kos and the other islands in the
Aegean to help control

06:12.839 --> 06:17.143
the influx. There have also been
calls for more ferries to take
the migrants to the mainland.

06:17.143 --> 06:20.680
But that only moves the
problem somewhere else.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.784
GWEN IFILL: The Greek government
said it's also sending a cruise
liner to Kos, to be

06:24.784 --> 06:29.422
converted into a processing
center for the migrants.

06:29.422 --> 06:34.961
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
rode a roller coaster today, as
China allowed its currency

06:34.961 --> 06:41.101
to fall for a second day. The
Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 277 points before
heading

06:41.101 --> 06:47.774
back up. In the end, the Dow was
just a fraction of a point
lower, closing near 17400. The

06:47.774 --> 06:53.747
Nasdaq rose seven points
and the S&P 500 added two.

06:53.747 --> 06:59.986
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
politics, policy and polls on
the campaign trail; Hillary

06:59.986 --> 07:05.025
Clinton agrees to hand over her
private e-mail server; how
China's currency could affect

07:05.025 --> 07:12.465
American business and
jobs, plus much more.

07:12.465 --> 07:24.077
GWEN IFILL: The last few days
have brought yet another twist
in the already dramatic

07:24.077 --> 07:28.281
race for president, with a new
New Hampshire poll showing
Democratic Senator Bernie
Sanders

07:28.281 --> 07:32.185
ahead of Hillary Clinton
for the first time.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.422
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports on the
changing campaign landscape in
both

07:35.422 --> 07:38.024
political parties.

07:38.024 --> 07:43.229
LISA DESJARDINS: What was a blur
of could-bes and would-bes now
is moving to the beginning

07:43.229 --> 07:49.769
of a defined 2016 horse race,
including a major twist on the
Democrats' side.

07:49.769 --> 07:53.673
When Vermont Senator Bernie
Sanders entered the race, it
seemed unlikely he could shake

07:53.673 --> 07:57.977
the assumption that Hillary
Clinton would be the Democratic
nominee, but this summer

07:57.977 --> 08:03.983
is blowing momentum his way in
the Northeast. Sanders has a
seven-point lead over Clinton

08:03.983 --> 08:08.054
in a New Hampshire poll released
yesterday. He still trails by
wide margins in national

08:08.054 --> 08:10.523
polls.

08:10.523 --> 08:15.829
But Sanders' biggest numbers are
his crowd numbers. He has
attracted eye-popping audiences

08:15.829 --> 08:21.735
like this one, 27,000 people at
a rally in Los Angeles over the
weekend. That's more

08:21.735 --> 08:27.874
than either Democrats or
Republicans have seen. As
Hillary Clinton pushes policy
ideas,

08:27.874 --> 08:32.946
including college tuition cuts,
Sanders' message of income
equality is resonating, here
earning

08:32.946 --> 08:36.049
endorsement of a
national nurses union.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.018
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: All of
you will remember when Martin
Luther

08:39.018 --> 08:43.890
King led the March on
Washington. You know what that
march was called? It was called

08:43.890 --> 08:46.159
Jobs and Justice.

08:46.159 --> 08:51.731
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, on
the GOP side, it's still
anyone's race. In Iowa, Donald

08:51.731 --> 08:56.403
Trump leads, followed by these
three Republicans. But take a
look at the latest New Hampshire

08:56.403 --> 08:58.772
poll, and those faces behind
Trump change completely.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.874
As for Trump:

09:00.874 --> 09:03.843
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We're going to have a
little fun tonight.

09:03.843 --> 09:08.782
LISA DESJARDINS: The CEO is now
looking to expand his need,
campaigning in more places

09:08.782 --> 09:14.220
like this event in Michigan last
night. Not that Trump is without
problems. He lost a

09:14.220 --> 09:18.758
top adviser this weekend
following his sharp comments
about FOX News anchor Megyn
Kelly.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.227
As Trump aims to
keep first place:

09:21.227 --> 09:25.165
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: We're facing an ISIS
and its ideology. What it is,

09:25.165 --> 09:29.836
is, to borrow a phrase, the
focus of evil in the modern
world.

09:29.836 --> 09:33.740
LISA DESJARDINS: Jeb Bush, who
was thought to be potential
front-runner before he entered

09:33.740 --> 09:39.145
the race, is hoping to actually
gain the top spot using policy,
foreign policy. He outlined

09:39.145 --> 09:43.616
it in this address at the Reagan
Library last night, blaming
President Obama and Hillary

09:43.616 --> 09:46.886
Clinton for the rise of the
Islamic State in Iraq.

09:46.886 --> 09:52.625
JEB BUSH: Where was Secretary of
State Clinton in all of this?
Like the president himself,

09:52.625 --> 09:58.364
she had opposed the surge, then
joined in claiming credit for
its success, then stood

09:58.364 --> 10:03.102
by as that hard-won victory by
American allied forces was
thrown away.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.638
LISA DESJARDINS: As for Clinton,
this week, she indicated she's
ready for challenges from

10:05.638 --> 10:07.974
both sides.

10:07.974 --> 10:11.411
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I'm
looking forward to debating,
first my

10:11.411 --> 10:15.615
friends and colleagues in the
Democratic side, and then, you
know, finally having a chance

10:15.615 --> 10:20.153
to debate the Republicans about
whatever their nominee has to
say.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.655
LISA DESJARDINS: Of course, all
candidates will have much more
to say in the days and

10:22.655 --> 10:24.457
weeks ahead.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.461
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Lisa Desjardins in Washington.

10:28.461 --> 10:33.500
GWEN IFILL: And there was other
news on Hillary Clinton's
campaign today, her surprise
move

10:33.500 --> 10:37.637
to turn her personal e-mail
server over to the Justice
Department. It followed new
details

10:37.637 --> 10:42.141
that some of them contained
classified information.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.279
Secretary Clinton has been
responding to questions about
her e-mail correspondence for
months.

10:46.279 --> 10:55.421
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I didn't
e-mail any classified material
to anyone on my e-mail.

10:55.421 --> 11:02.362
There is no classified material.
So I'm certainly well aware of
the classification requirements

11:02.362 --> 11:07.033
and didn't send
classified material.

11:07.033 --> 11:12.038
I am confident that I never sent
nor received any information
that was classified at the

11:12.038 --> 11:16.176
time it was sent and received.
This is really a question for
the State Department. They're

11:16.176 --> 11:22.949
the ones that are bearing the
responsibility to, you know,
sort through these thousands

11:22.949 --> 11:30.123
and thousands of e-mails and
determine at what pace they can
be released. And, you know,

11:30.123 --> 11:34.360
I really hope that it would
be as quickly as possible.

11:34.360 --> 11:39.232
GWEN IFILL: We are joined now by
Anita Kumar, White House
correspondent for McClatchy
Newspapers.

11:39.232 --> 11:44.103
Anita, we just saw the way her
questions have changed -- her
answers have changed ever so

11:44.103 --> 11:48.508
slightly over the summer. What
is the difference between what
she said in the answers to these

11:48.508 --> 11:51.010
questions when they first came
up and what she is saying now?

11:51.010 --> 11:50.643
ANITA KUMAR, White House
Correspondent, McClatchy
Newspapers: I think there is
actually a lot

11:50.643 --> 11:53.379
of similarities.

11:53.379 --> 11:58.918
She said -- she stuck to the
fact that she didn't send or
receive classified information.

11:58.918 --> 12:02.822
Now, her response has changed
because she said she wouldn't
give up the server, she

12:02.822 --> 12:04.524
wouldn't give up the thumb
drives with the e-mails, and
she's clearly changed her mind

12:04.524 --> 12:06.759
about that.

12:06.759 --> 12:10.897
But what she has said still is
that she didn't send or receive
classified information.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.067
GWEN IFILL: The other thing she
said today in a statement that
her campaign put out today

12:14.067 --> 12:17.270
was that she was only one four
secretaries of state who were
asked to turn over these

12:17.270 --> 12:21.007
e-mails who did. Is that so?

12:21.007 --> 12:25.311
ANITA KUMAR: Yes, the
investigation is actually into
the five. They have looked at
the last

12:25.311 --> 12:28.848
five secretaries of state and
their aides, if they want to get
those -- they're allowed

12:28.848 --> 12:31.250
to look at the aides.

12:31.250 --> 12:35.154
Their jurisdiction is to look at
the aides, so they are looking
at that, but she has said,

12:35.154 --> 12:39.158
I have turned over more
information than anyone else.
She also was the last sitting
secretary

12:39.158 --> 12:41.494
of state and probably had
more e-mail than anyone.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.596
GWEN IFILL: And probably the
only one actually running for
president.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.131
(CROSSTALK)

12:45.131 --> 12:51.004
GWEN IFILL: So let's talk about
what we think or what she has
said is on this thumb drive

12:51.004 --> 12:55.942
in these classified server -- or
-- not a classified server --
private server that she

12:55.942 --> 12:58.778
turned over today. What do we
think it -- what does she say is
in it?

12:58.778 --> 13:03.149
ANITA KUMAR: Well, she says --
so she had 60,000 e-mails on the
server. It was everything

13:03.149 --> 13:05.852
that she e-mailed, personal and
work e-mail while she was
secretary of state for four

13:05.852 --> 13:08.154
years.

13:08.154 --> 13:13.860
She turned 30,000 over to the
State Department, and the others
she said were personal and

13:13.860 --> 13:17.697
she wiped it clean. So it's
really unclear what's on the
server now. I have talked to

13:17.697 --> 13:21.234
experts who say you can get rid
of everything on a server, and I
have talked to experts

13:21.234 --> 13:24.671
who say, unless you really know
what you're doing, you're not
getting rid of everything.

13:24.671 --> 13:29.108
GWEN IFILL: So when you say
wiped clean, that's not just
simply deleting it for storage
reasons?

13:29.108 --> 13:32.345
ANITA KUMAR: If you delete for
storage, it's still there
somewhere. You have to use the

13:32.345 --> 13:35.782
appropriate tools. And these are
technology experts who say it
depends really on the tools

13:35.782 --> 13:37.917
she used.

13:37.917 --> 13:42.121
If someone is in this field and
knows what they're doing, they
might be wiped clean.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.690
GWEN IFILL: And you mentioned
Clinton's aides. They are being
investigated on this front

13:43.690 --> 13:45.591
as well?

13:45.591 --> 13:50.296
ANITA KUMAR: They are. The State
Department inspector general
told us this week that they're

13:50.296 --> 13:55.068
looking into some of her top
aides who did use personal
e-mail for work as well. At
least

13:55.068 --> 14:00.573
one aide also had an account on
her -- on Clinton's private
server.

14:00.573 --> 14:06.212
GWEN IFILL: One of the things
that Secretary Clinton has said
is that she didn't use -- send

14:06.212 --> 14:08.748
anything to her home server that
was classified at the time.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.283
ANITA KUMAR: Right.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.486
GWEN IFILL: What does that
distinction mean, the difference
between what's classified,

14:13.486 --> 14:17.690
what is sensitive and what may
have been just purely personal?
Is there a distinction? And

14:17.690 --> 14:18.558
can you reclassify things?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.026
(CROSSTALK)

14:20.026 --> 14:23.129
ANITA KUMAR: You can classify
later. And that's basically
what's happening.

14:23.129 --> 14:27.834
There were no markings that said
this was -- something was
classified. And that's really

14:27.834 --> 14:31.671
what she's relying on. And her
language is very clear. And she
talks about the markings.

14:31.671 --> 14:36.109
There were no markings, she
says. But what is happening now
is that since the State
Department

14:36.109 --> 14:39.579
is looking through them, they're
releasing them to the public,
part of a lawsuit that

14:39.579 --> 14:42.048
says they have to release State
Department e-mails, they're
looking through and they're

14:42.048 --> 14:44.684
redacting things that
need to be redacted.

14:44.684 --> 14:49.288
Now, some of it is personal.
They're not listing someone's
e-mail address. It's other
things.

14:49.288 --> 14:54.227
This doesn't mean it's
classified or top secret. But
the inspector general for the
intelligence

14:54.227 --> 14:59.098
community has started to look at
these e-mails. And that's where
these five e-mails come in

14:59.098 --> 15:04.437
that he says are classified, not
that they were at the time, but
they should be classified.

15:04.437 --> 15:09.008
GWEN IFILL: It is easy to
confuse, especially when the
person is running for president,

15:09.008 --> 15:13.613
a legal dilemma with a political
dilemma. How is this being
treated by all the parties,

15:13.613 --> 15:16.549
as a legal question or is
it a mix of all of it?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.184
ANITA KUMAR: Isn't
everything political?

15:18.184 --> 15:20.253
GWEN IFILL: Yes, I suppose.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.257
ANITA KUMAR: There are legal
questions, there's no doubt
about it.

15:24.257 --> 15:29.228
But the FBI, which is looking
into the matter, the inspector
generals of two agencies that

15:29.228 --> 15:34.300
are looking into it have been
very clear that what they're
doing is not a criminal
investigation

15:34.300 --> 15:37.937
at this time. That doesn't mean
it wouldn't be at some point. It
could be. We will see

15:37.937 --> 15:41.507
what happens, but they are
pretty -- they are very adamant
she is not the target of

15:41.507 --> 15:45.111
a criminal probe right
now. So that could change.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.480
I think it's really politics
now. I'm not saying that no one
did anything wrong, but

15:47.480 --> 15:49.515
the ramifications for her...

15:49.515 --> 15:50.349
GWEN IFILL: The reason
why it doesn't go away.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.418
ANITA KUMAR: Yes -- is politics.

15:52.418 --> 15:56.556
GWEN IFILL: But there is also a
House investigation that is
still outstanding.

15:56.556 --> 16:00.159
ANITA KUMAR: Yes, there is a
House investigation, and she's
going to testify October 22, so

16:00.159 --> 16:02.695
that will be a big deal.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.399
And the other thing that keeps
coming up is, the State
Department is releasing the
e-mails.

16:06.399 --> 16:11.204
They have to by -- as part of a
lawsuit. So at the end of every
month -- and we will see

16:11.204 --> 16:14.574
this at the end of August -- we
will see more e-mails. And every
time a new batch comes

16:14.574 --> 16:16.309
out, there is all sorts of
new stories to talk about.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.678
GWEN IFILL: We know who
will be reading them all.

16:18.678 --> 16:26.953
Anita Kumar from McClatchy
Newspapers, thank you very much.

16:26.953 --> 16:33.092
ANITA KUMAR: Thanks so much.

16:33.092 --> 16:38.698
JUDY WOODRUFF: World stock and
currency markets were rocked for
a second straight day today,

16:38.698 --> 16:43.469
as China continued to devalue
its currency, the yuan.

16:43.469 --> 16:48.174
While the drop is not expected
to have a big affect on most
Americans, and the tumult on

16:48.174 --> 16:53.880
Wall Street had calmed by day's
end, some analysts are saying
that for U.S. companies

16:53.880 --> 16:59.752
who are doing a lot of business
inside China, among them Apple,
Coca-Cola, and fast food

16:59.752 --> 17:05.258
retailer Yum! Brands, the change
could hurt sales and trim
profits.

17:05.258 --> 17:11.097
For more on China's move and its
ripple effects, we turn to Eswar
Prasad, professor of trade

17:11.097 --> 17:17.103
policy at Cornell University,
and Mike McDonough. He's chief
global economist at Bloomberg
Intelligence.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.605
Welcome to you both.

17:19.605 --> 17:24.076
Eswar Prasad, to you first. What
does it say that the Chinese
Central Bank for the second

17:24.076 --> 17:29.515
day in a row has decided to let
its currency be decided by
market forces?

17:29.515 --> 17:32.451
ESWAR PRASAD, Professor of Trade
Policy, Cornell University:
Well, China is doing exactly
what

17:32.451 --> 17:37.556
it said it would do, which is to
let the currency's value be
determined by the market, and
the

17:37.556 --> 17:43.562
market wants to push the yuan a
little lower because China's
economy isn't doing so well.

17:43.562 --> 17:48.100
But there is also a good side to
it, because China has been
trying to open up its capital

17:48.100 --> 17:52.672
account, that is, make it easier
for money to flow in and out of
China. And for good

17:52.672 --> 17:56.309
reasons, for diversification and
so forth, a lot of money had
been going out of China

17:56.309 --> 17:59.912
because households and
corporations want to invest
abroad.

17:59.912 --> 18:05.518
Now, the difficulty is that
China is undertaking this move
at a time when it's good for
China,

18:05.518 --> 18:10.089
but not necessarily for the rest
of the world. So, the Chinese
economy has been weak. The

18:10.089 --> 18:14.460
Central Bank has been trying to
do everything it can to prop up
the economy, through interest

18:14.460 --> 18:18.631
rate cuts, reducing the amount
of reserves that Chinese banks
have to keep with the Central

18:18.631 --> 18:22.401
Bank, so that there can be more
credit flowing to the economy.

18:22.401 --> 18:26.405
Nothing has worked that well.
So, now they're turning to the
currency as an added boost.

18:26.405 --> 18:29.542
This may be good for China, but
it is going to be complicated
for the rest of the world.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.145
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mike
McDonough, are we better able to
today to tell whether this

18:33.145 --> 18:38.884
is driven by true -- a desire
for reform, to let these
currency rates be determined

18:38.884 --> 18:45.491
by market forces, or is it all
about boosting China's lagging
growth rate?

18:45.491 --> 18:47.126
MIKE MCDONOUGH, Bloomberg
Intelligence: Well, I think
Eswar hit the nail on the head,
where

18:47.126 --> 18:50.096
the timing is perfect.

18:50.096 --> 18:55.334
It's about the reform, but it's
also about the devaluation that
you saw. Basically, China

18:55.334 --> 18:59.572
took a measure that is certainly
going to help bolster their
export sector, but then

18:59.572 --> 19:02.742
they put this caveat on the end
saying, going forward, we're
going to let the market set

19:02.742 --> 19:05.177
the rate.

19:05.177 --> 19:09.715
So, if you were a policy-maker,
you got exactly what you want.
But the problem is, by doing

19:09.715 --> 19:15.488
this sudden devaluation, they
did lose a bit of credibility.
So there's talk about the

19:15.488 --> 19:20.893
yuan being an SDR, the IMF
recognizing it as a sort of
global currency.

19:20.893 --> 19:26.565
They really hurt their
credibility by doing this sudden
devaluation, this one-off 2
percent.

19:26.565 --> 19:31.837
So, what they need to do now is
prove, follow through, continue
letting the market set the

19:31.837 --> 19:36.075
yuan. And what you're seeing and
why you're seeing so much
turbulence in the market is

19:36.075 --> 19:39.712
because, because they did the 2
percent, they lost the
credibility.

19:39.712 --> 19:44.717
People are scared now. People
are concerned that if China
continues slowing down, they're

19:44.717 --> 19:50.256
going to do another one-off
devaluation, and that's a big
risk. They need to now follow

19:50.256 --> 19:53.492
through. There is an execution
risk. They need to follow
through with what they said.

19:53.492 --> 19:57.530
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eswar, I know
that there are implications
globally for this, but let's

19:57.530 --> 20:02.368
try to focus on the United
States right now. We mentioned
U.S. companies that are deeply

20:02.368 --> 20:06.872
invested in China. Where do they
stand to come out of this, or is
it just too early

20:06.872 --> 20:09.442
to know yet?

20:09.442 --> 20:13.579
ESWAR PRASAD: So far, the
depreciation of the yuan has
been relatively modest.

20:13.579 --> 20:18.184
And, remember, the U.S. dollar
has been very, very strong over
the last year. It's appreciated

20:18.184 --> 20:22.822
by about 20 percent relative to
currencies like the euro and the
yen. There is only one

20:22.822 --> 20:26.692
major currency against which it
is appreciated by this 2 percent
before this devaluation,

20:26.692 --> 20:29.462
and that's the Chinese yuan.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.932
So this is just adjusting for
that a little bit. But for the
U.S., it is going to be in

20:32.932 --> 20:37.770
a slightly uncomfortable if the
yuan and every other major
currency is on the other side

20:37.770 --> 20:40.873
trying to weaken their currency
relative to the dollar.

20:40.873 --> 20:46.579
Now, for companies that are in
the U.S., but are operating in
China, it's a double blow.

20:46.579 --> 20:51.550
First of all, this signals that
the Chinese economy is going to
remain weak. And the government

20:51.550 --> 20:54.854
in China is certainly very
concerned about the weakness in
the economy, so that's going

20:54.854 --> 20:58.624
to affect earnings of a
company like Apple in China.

20:58.624 --> 21:03.462
But, in addition, a lot of the
foreign earnings in China and
elsewhere are going to be
affected

21:03.462 --> 21:08.334
when that money comes back to
the U.S., because the U.S.
dollar is stronger and China's
move

21:08.334 --> 21:12.338
is certainly going to keep the
dollar even stronger than it
would otherwise be. And that

21:12.338 --> 21:15.741
will is going to earnings in
dollars, so it could potentially
be a double blow for companies

21:15.741 --> 21:19.178
like Apple operating in China.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.847
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike McDonough,
what would you add to that? What
do you see as the effect

21:21.847 --> 21:22.414
in the U.S.?

21:22.414 --> 21:22.915
(CROSSTALK)

21:22.915 --> 21:25.017
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.820
MIKE MCDONOUGH: What you really
need to look at isn't the
devaluation. It was relatively

21:27.820 --> 21:29.955
minor.

21:29.955 --> 21:36.328
The problem is, why did they do
it? China's economy is hurting.
It is slowing down. They're

21:36.328 --> 21:41.767
doing everything they can to --
in a best-case scenario, in my
view, China, they don't have

21:41.767 --> 21:46.071
a resurgence in growth.
They stabilize growth.

21:46.071 --> 21:51.043
So you have the world's second
largest economy, which has been
this big tailwind for global

21:51.043 --> 21:55.748
growth, not just in the U.S.,
but everywhere -- they're a big
consumer of our exports --
suddenly

21:55.748 --> 22:00.052
sputtering. So this tailwind is
becoming a headwind. That's the
real concern. It's not

22:00.052 --> 22:03.489
the devaluation. It's,
why did they do it?

22:03.489 --> 22:07.860
China's economy is slowing.
Demand is slowing for goods in
general, and that's the real

22:07.860 --> 22:10.496
problem. They need to
basically buoy growth.

22:10.496 --> 22:16.035
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Eswar, as
you're saying, that has real
effects on countries around

22:16.035 --> 22:21.173
the globe and including in the
U.S., I mean, these companies
that we mentioned and others.

22:21.173 --> 22:25.844
I think some American consumers
may also be asking, is this
going to affect me?

22:25.844 --> 22:30.649
ESWAR PRASAD: For the American
consumers, it could be a mixed
blessing, because if China's

22:30.649 --> 22:35.354
currency continues to weaken and
if other currencies around the
world try to weaken

22:35.354 --> 22:38.157
themselves even more in order to
compete more effectively with
China, that's going to mean

22:38.157 --> 22:40.459
a stronger dollar.

22:40.459 --> 22:44.463
And a stronger dollar means a
couple of good things for U.S.
consumers. Number one, it

22:44.463 --> 22:49.401
means cheaper imports from the
rest of the world. And, second,
it also means lower interest

22:49.401 --> 22:53.472
rates, because even if the Fed
were to hike short-term policy
interest rates sometimes

22:53.472 --> 22:57.876
later this year, long-term rates
in the U.S. are likely to remain
low.

22:57.876 --> 23:03.415
And long-term rates are what
determine mortgage rates, auto
loan rates and so on. So that's

23:03.415 --> 23:07.753
all good for U.S. consumers. But
there are some sectors of the
economy that are very

23:07.753 --> 23:12.324
export-oriented that are going
to get hurt, because, first of
all, foreign companies are

23:12.324 --> 23:15.961
going to be much more
competitive here and Americans
are going to find it much harder

23:15.961 --> 23:18.697
to export to the
rest of the world.

23:18.697 --> 23:22.868
So the benefits are going to be
widespread, but the pain is
going to be concentrated in

23:22.868 --> 23:28.007
some sectors that could face
fairly significant job losses
and the loss of economic
momentum.

23:28.007 --> 23:31.644
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike McDonough,
just quickly, so, what do you
suspect now? What are you

23:31.644 --> 23:35.681
looking for now as we watch
what China is doing?

23:35.681 --> 23:40.486
MIKE MCDONOUGH: You know, I
think, you know, China is going
to have to continue implementing

23:40.486 --> 23:46.125
a bit more stimulus. I think
they have the firepower to at
least stabilize growth that

23:46.125 --> 23:51.196
you have seen in China, but I
think you're not going to see
the China of the past.

23:51.196 --> 23:56.802
China is going to continue to
slow. They're going to try to
stabilize that slowdown. They're

23:56.802 --> 24:00.873
going to continue trying to
reform their economy. And
they're going to continue
opening up,

24:00.873 --> 24:05.477
but it is going to be these
basically short cycles where
everyone gets really euphoric

24:05.477 --> 24:08.781
about China because they think
things are looking better, and
then they're going to

24:08.781 --> 24:11.250
implement some reforms, there
will be some signs that things
are sputtering again, and

24:11.250 --> 24:14.520
then there will be these
concerns about the hard landing.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.090
Right now, we're in one of these
down periods, but eventually
things will stabilize. But

24:18.090 --> 24:21.627
it's going to, going forward, be
this panic and euphoria very
short period phases going

24:21.627 --> 24:23.462
on in China.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.731
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have
certainly gotten everybody's
attention for the last two days.

24:25.731 --> 24:26.965
MIKE MCDONOUGH: Definitely.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.169
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mike McDonough
with Bloomberg, Eswar Prasad at
Cornell University, we thank

24:30.169 --> 24:30.769
you both.

24:30.769 --> 24:31.337
MIKE MCDONOUGH: Thank you.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.237
ESWAR PRASAD: Thank you.

24:32.237 --> 24:36.308
MIKE MCDONOUGH: Thank
you very much.

24:36.308 --> 24:45.751
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

24:45.751 --> 24:51.857
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
a major opponent of the Iran
nuclear deal changed his mind;

24:51.857 --> 24:56.495
unleashing musical gifts early
in life; and the rise of heroin
in the heartland of small-town

24:56.495 --> 24:58.630
America.

24:58.630 --> 25:04.002
But, first, tonight, we launch a
series of conversations on the
pros and cons of the

25:04.002 --> 25:08.440
contentious debate over the
nuclear agreement with Iran,
which Congress has 36 more days

25:08.440 --> 25:12.411
to review, Deal or No Deal.

25:12.411 --> 25:16.582
Tonight, Hari Sreenivasan talks
to a well-respected nuclear
expert who just resigned as
president

25:16.582 --> 25:20.252
of a group which
publicly opposes it.

25:20.252 --> 25:25.624
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gary Samore
helped establish the advocacy
group United Against a Nuclear

25:25.624 --> 25:31.730
Iran in 2008, before serious
negotiations had begun over
Iran's nuclear program. The

25:31.730 --> 25:35.534
goal? Strengthen sanctions
against Tehran in the face of
what Samore and others believed

25:35.534 --> 25:39.171
was a clandestine
nuclear program.

25:39.171 --> 25:44.943
From 2009 to 2013, Samore served
as President Obama's White House
coordinator for arms control

25:44.943 --> 25:48.480
and weapons of mass destruction,
while serious talks between the
so-called P5-plus-one and

25:48.480 --> 25:51.817
Iran were under way.

25:51.817 --> 25:55.120
After leaving the White House,
Samore went to the Belfer Center
for Science and International

25:55.120 --> 25:59.458
Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government. When the
nuclear deal was signed with
Iran

25:59.458 --> 26:04.563
last month, there was
near-unanimous opposition to the
pact from Samore's fellow
members of

26:04.563 --> 26:09.134
the anti-Iran-nuclear advocacy
group. It is resuming a
multimillion-dollar advertising

26:09.134 --> 26:12.638
campaign denouncing the deal.

26:12.638 --> 26:15.441
But Samore's judgment was
different. He was satisfied with
the Iran agreement, and he

26:15.441 --> 26:19.244
has now stepped down as
the group's president.

26:19.244 --> 26:23.549
On Monday, former Connecticut
Democratic and independent
Senator Joseph Lieberman, a
decided

26:23.549 --> 26:27.286
opponent of the Iran deal, was
named as the chairman of United
Against a Nuclear Iran

26:27.286 --> 26:28.454
organization.

26:28.454 --> 26:31.423
And Gary Samore joins me now.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.660
So, you worked with an
organization. At least for the
past two years, you helped lead
an

26:34.660 --> 26:38.530
organization that's core mission
was to prevent Iran from getting
nuclear weapons. What made

26:38.530 --> 26:40.499
you want to step down?

26:40.499 --> 26:42.334
GARY SAMORE, Former Presidential
Adviser on Arms Control: Well,
as you said, I disagreed

26:42.334 --> 26:47.139
with the organization on whether
or not to support the agreement.

26:47.139 --> 26:52.811
In my judgment, this agreement
is the best available option to
prevent Iran from acquiring

26:52.811 --> 26:58.250
nuclear weapons. Others in the
group came to a different
conclusion. I respect that,

26:58.250 --> 27:04.022
but under the circumstances, I
didn't feel I could continue to
be president of the organization

27:04.022 --> 27:07.359
at the same time that they were
mounting a campaign to encourage
Congress to reject the

27:07.359 --> 27:09.127
agreement.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.464
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, are they
wrong in doing that? They seem
to be doubling down on this

27:12.464 --> 27:15.400
campaign to try to convince and
the U.S. public that this is a
bad deal.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.303
GARY SAMORE: Well, I can
understand their views.

27:18.303 --> 27:22.174
I think there are elements of
this agreement that I'm not
comfortable with. I think it

27:22.174 --> 27:27.946
leaves Iran with a larger
enrichment program than I would
prefer and I think the duration

27:27.946 --> 27:31.884
of the agreement isn't as long
as I would like. But, on the
other hand, I think the

27:31.884 --> 27:34.820
agreement has some
positive elements.

27:34.820 --> 27:40.726
It constrains Iran's ability to
produce fissile material for
nuclear weapons at its declared

27:40.726 --> 27:47.900
facilities for at least 15
years. And it establishes a
verification and enforcement
mechanism that

27:47.900 --> 27:53.238
I think will improve our ability
to catch Iran cheating and our
ability to reimpose

27:53.238 --> 27:55.207
sanctions.

27:55.207 --> 28:01.046
So, on balance, I think the
advantages outweigh the
disadvantages. And I'm skeptical
we can

28:01.046 --> 28:06.451
negotiate a significantly better
deal within a short period of
time.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.887
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
about some of those concerns.
You have actually expressed

28:08.887 --> 28:12.891
this in writings and
speeches and elsewhere.

28:12.891 --> 28:17.429
One of the concerns you had was
that Iran, even in a recent
paper that you published

28:17.429 --> 28:23.268
at the Belfer Center, is that
this might increase Iran's
ability to create nuclear
weapons in

28:23.268 --> 28:29.608
a covert manner. While there
might be opportunities for us to
catch that, it doesn't prevent
it.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.778
GARY SAMORE: Well, I think you
have to recognize that any
inspection mechanism will have
strengths

28:32.778 --> 28:35.781
and weaknesses.

28:35.781 --> 28:41.086
The system that the agreement
puts in place will improve our
ability to catch Iran if

28:41.086 --> 28:47.392
they try to build secret
facilities to process nuclear
material, like a covert
enrichment

28:47.392 --> 28:53.131
plant. We already have good
capability through national
intelligence and by working with

28:53.131 --> 28:56.935
our allies and their national
intelligence agencies, but the
agreement, I think, will

28:56.935 --> 29:01.573
amplify our national
intelligence.

29:01.573 --> 29:07.579
In other areas, like
weaponization research, it's
very difficult for either
national intelligence

29:07.579 --> 29:14.753
or an inspection system to
really have confidence in
catching and detecting that kind
of activity.

29:14.753 --> 29:20.959
So, on balance, I think you have
to say that the agreement
strengthens our ability to deal

29:20.959 --> 29:27.766
with any effort by Iran to build
a covert nuclear processing
facility, but probably

29:27.766 --> 29:31.870
is not going to be able to catch
them if they do small-scale
weapons research.

29:31.870 --> 29:35.974
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
time limits? You have said you
were a little uncomfortable.

29:35.974 --> 29:40.979
You said you wished it was
longer. But in these 10 to 15
years, do we clamp down enough

29:40.979 --> 29:44.349
on their ability
to enrich uranium?

29:44.349 --> 29:51.790
GARY SAMORE: I think, for 15
years, the limits on enrichment
and the limits on their efforts

29:51.790 --> 29:58.163
to construct any capability to
produce plutonium are very solid
at the declared facilities.

29:58.163 --> 30:03.435
So Iran really won't have an
option to produce fissile
material for nuclear weapons for
at

30:03.435 --> 30:09.808
least 15 years. Even at year 15,
when the physical limits are
lifted, it would still

30:09.808 --> 30:15.580
take Iran a couple of more years
to expand its program and have a
credible capacity.

30:15.580 --> 30:20.686
The gamble, of course, is that
we just don't have any way of
predicting, in 15 years, what

30:20.686 --> 30:24.790
kind of government in Iran
we're going to be facing.

30:24.790 --> 30:30.896
And the concern is that we may
still have a government in
Tehran in 15 years that has

30:30.896 --> 30:35.634
ambitions to develop nuclear
weapons, and the question will
be whether -- whoever is

30:35.634 --> 30:40.439
president at that time, whether
they're going to be able to
reassemble international
pressure

30:40.439 --> 30:45.243
if Iran has actually complied
with this agreement for 15
years.

30:45.243 --> 30:49.815
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
through-lines from critics is,
was there a better deal to

30:49.815 --> 30:54.386
be had? Was the extension of
sanctions, perhaps, over a
longer period of time, would
that have

30:54.386 --> 30:59.091
forced Iran to the table in
less of a strong position?

30:59.091 --> 31:03.729
GARY SAMORE: You know, it's very
difficult to replay history, and
unless you're actually

31:03.729 --> 31:09.468
sitting in the negotiating room,
I think it's very hard to make a
judgment about whether

31:09.468 --> 31:14.139
a better deal, significantly
better deal could have been
negotiated. So I'm not really
able

31:14.139 --> 31:17.142
to make that judgment.

31:17.142 --> 31:23.281
The question, I think, is this
deal compared to a better deal
if we reject it and try to

31:23.281 --> 31:29.988
renegotiate? And I think, in the
near term, it's unlikely that we
could negotiate a deal

31:29.988 --> 31:34.593
that would be significantly
better. My judgment at the end
of the day is that it's better

31:34.593 --> 31:39.097
to have a bird in hand than two
in the bush, and I think this
deal is good enough so that

31:39.097 --> 31:40.732
we should support it.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.101
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gary Samore,
thanks so much for joining us.

31:43.101 --> 31:46.571
GARY SAMORE: Thank you, Hari.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.407
On our next Deal or No Deal
segment, we will hear from an
opponent of the Iran nuclear

31:49.407 --> 31:53.478
agreement.

31:53.478 --> 32:05.791
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: If you take
a look at musical orchestras
across the country, you

32:05.791 --> 32:12.264
will find a striking lack of
black and Latino players. For
more than 30 years, Project
STEP,

32:12.264 --> 32:17.469
based just beneath the Symphony
Hall stage in Boston, has been
trying to change that.

32:17.469 --> 32:23.108
Now its mentoring program for
young musicians is even getting
attention from the White House.

32:23.108 --> 32:28.613
Jared Bowen of PBS station
MD-BöWGBH in Boston has the
story.

32:28.613 --> 32:36.321
JARED BOWEN, WGBH: They have all
the bearings of the classically
trained and the classically

32:36.321 --> 32:51.269
gifted, years of study at play,
despite their few years. And
they are, in many respects,

32:51.269 --> 32:53.104
the unlikely.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.408
MARY JAFFEE, Executive Director,
Project STEP: Some kids are born
with a musicality that

32:56.408 --> 33:01.213
really shows through at age 5.
You can see it in the way that
they move to music. You

33:01.213 --> 33:04.382
can see it in the way
they follow rhythms.

33:04.382 --> 33:09.588
MAN: One, two, three, four.

33:09.588 --> 33:16.494
JARED BOWEN: Mary Jaffee is the
executive director of Project
STEP, a Boston organization

33:16.494 --> 33:21.600
that teases talent out of kids
who might otherwise find it
squandered. Her mission is
simple:

33:21.600 --> 33:25.237
to change the face
of classical music.

33:25.237 --> 33:32.277
MARY JAFFEE: There are so few --
in fact, virtually -- almost no
African-American and

33:32.277 --> 33:36.548
Latino musicians in
orchestras and in audiences.

33:36.548 --> 33:42.654
JARED BOWEN: Since 1982, Project
STEP has pushed to correct that
imbalance. Each year,

33:42.654 --> 33:48.360
it fans out across Boston
kindergarten classes,
identifying students with
unusual potential.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.464
MARY JAFFEE: From that 50 to 100
kids, we take in three to four a
year, so it's a very

33:52.464 --> 33:57.469
narrow bottleneck. Those
kids are highly talented.

33:57.469 --> 34:01.339
MAN: So, the trick is to play
them all in the right time.

34:01.339 --> 34:05.510
JARED BOWEN: These young
children are among the finalists
for acceptance into Project

34:05.510 --> 34:10.849
STEP. If chosen, they will be
plunged into an intensive music
immersion program.

34:10.849 --> 34:15.687
From now until they graduate
high school, they will take
weekly classes, receive
one-on-one

34:15.687 --> 34:21.593
lessons and they're expected to
complete hours of at-home
practice. And that's all on top

34:21.593 --> 34:27.532
of their regular schoolwork. At
this last stage of selection,
the students are divided

34:27.532 --> 34:32.203
into small groups for a month of
violin lessons perfecting how
they hold their bow, position

34:32.203 --> 34:35.974
their feet and read music.

34:35.974 --> 34:41.613
Susan Jarvis has been teaching
the class for 13 years,
scrutinizing their mastery of
music.

34:41.613 --> 34:45.317
SUSAN JARVIS, Teacher, Project
STEP: It's a matter of finding
which child -- which children

34:45.317 --> 34:52.023
can adapt to it the fastest.
Every child can do it in their
own time, but some kids are

34:52.023 --> 34:58.163
maybe a little more innately
coordinated or have a really
strong interest in it.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.598
Hands up if you know
where A-string is.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.600
JARED BOWEN: They are so young.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.868
SUSAN JARVIS: These
guys are old.

35:03.868 --> 35:05.637
(LAUGHTER)

35:05.637 --> 35:10.442
SUSAN JARVIS: These are a joy to
teach every year, because
they're 5 and 6 years old. And

35:10.442 --> 35:14.980
that's a big difference from the
3- and 4-year-olds, which I -- I
normally teach.

35:14.980 --> 35:20.185
JARED BOWEN: Just as important
as the music is what happens at
home. Project STEP will

35:20.185 --> 35:24.723
select only students who have
full parental involvement. In
class, they are fully behind

35:24.723 --> 35:26.858
the students.

35:26.858 --> 35:31.229
SUSAN JARVIS: Let's get some
help from your parents. They're
going to be your beat partners.

35:31.229 --> 35:36.001
They're going to keep your eyes
on the music, and you're going
to keep your eyes on their

35:36.001 --> 35:40.171
fingers.

35:40.171 --> 35:49.114
The parents are the lifeline. We
work pretty hard to tell the
parents what to do, how to

35:49.114 --> 35:52.851
do it, and how many times to do
it, because in teaching a string
instrument, there's just

35:52.851 --> 35:55.887
not a lot of room for
error at the beginning.

35:55.887 --> 36:00.025
AJANI BOYD, Student, Project
STEP: Personally, music just
calms me down. Like, it makes me

36:00.025 --> 36:02.293
feel good inside.

36:02.293 --> 36:07.098
JARED BOWEN: At 11 years old,
Ajani Boyd has now played with
Project STEP longer than he

36:07.098 --> 36:12.504
hasn't. He's all about the bass
now, but he was 4 when he chose
the cello.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.673
AJANI BOYD: I picked the cello.
And, honestly, I kind of picked
the cello because I could

36:15.673 --> 36:17.742
sit down.

36:17.742 --> 36:22.147
JARED BOWEN: He can be forgiven
the easy choice, given the
program's demands, practice
daily

36:22.147 --> 36:26.351
and up to nine hours
every Saturday.

36:26.351 --> 36:33.291
MARY JAFFEE: It's pretty
intense. The new measure of
10,000 hours of preparation,
rehearsal,

36:33.291 --> 36:37.195
practice, whatever it is, they
put it in by the time they're in
high school. It's an -- it's

36:37.195 --> 36:39.697
just an awful lot.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.902
JARED BOWEN: But it served Njeri
Grevious well. She's now a
sophomore at Yale University

36:43.902 --> 36:46.271
studying mathematics.

36:46.271 --> 36:50.508
Do you think about what would
have been if you didn't have an
opportunity like this?

36:50.508 --> 36:57.182
NJERI GREVIOUS, Yale University:
Very difficult, almost
impossible. I actually don't
want to

36:57.182 --> 36:59.951
think about that. I definitely
think it's -- I have been so
blessed.

36:59.951 --> 37:04.022
JARED BOWEN: Grevious spent 12
years in Project STEP, including
a time, she says, when her

37:04.022 --> 37:06.724
family was left homeless.

37:06.724 --> 37:11.796
NJERI GREVIOUS: When we were
living out of the car, when
sometimes it was very, very

37:11.796 --> 37:17.702
cold waking up in the morning,
no heating in the house, and
trying to practice, we pull

37:17.702 --> 37:20.472
-- were able to put all that
aside, because, when we're
engaging with our instruments,

37:20.472 --> 37:23.374
its just us, ourselves, our
instruments, our music.

37:23.374 --> 37:27.912
And then when we're playing with
other people, it's all of that
times -- to the nth power.

37:27.912 --> 37:32.884
And we're able to find
peace and solace.

37:32.884 --> 37:38.423
JARED BOWEN: Working off a tight
budget with money it receives
from foundations and individual

37:38.423 --> 37:42.894
donors, Project STEP subsidizes
virtually all the students'
expenses, roughly $9,000

37:42.894 --> 37:46.498
to $11,000 annually.

37:46.498 --> 37:50.168
It gives them opportunity, while
their base in the basement of
Symphony Hall gives them

37:50.168 --> 37:52.070
access.

37:52.070 --> 37:56.407
MARY JAFFEE: One parent put it
that she didn't think she could
touch Symphony Hall. She used

37:56.407 --> 38:00.678
to walk by it and thought it
just wasn't for her. And now
she's learned to navigate the

38:00.678 --> 38:04.382
halls and say hello to
some of the musicians.

38:04.382 --> 38:10.054
JARED BOWEN: And even play with
them. There are not many people,
let alone 11-year-olds,

38:10.054 --> 38:15.193
who can claim to have performed
on stage with one of the most
famous musicians of our time.

38:15.193 --> 38:19.330
NJERI GREVIOUS: Here is Yo-Yo
Ma, and then a little bit next
to him is me.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.833
(LAUGHTER)

38:21.833 --> 38:29.674
NJERI GREVIOUS: That was an
incredible opportunity that I
got, and I will never forget
that moment.

38:29.674 --> 38:33.678
JARED BOWEN: The moments don't
get much bigger, though, than
when Project STEP was honored

38:33.678 --> 38:38.516
by the White House late last
year with a National Arts and
Humanities Youth Program Award,
presented

38:38.516 --> 38:41.686
by first lady Michelle Obama.

38:41.686 --> 38:45.657
AJANI BOYD: It's just crazy to
be able to say, "when I came
back from the White House."

38:45.657 --> 38:50.395
I mean, it's -- being -- going
to the White House was amazing.
It was such a fun experience.

38:50.395 --> 38:55.266
Met a lot of people. I got to
meet the first lady. So it was
just awesome in all.

38:55.266 --> 38:59.837
JARED BOWEN: All of this is a
testament to the music and the
instruction, that in an

38:59.837 --> 39:04.509
age of attention deficits, these
students will practice thousands
of hours. In moments

39:04.509 --> 39:09.147
of crisis, music is
their salvation.

39:09.147 --> 39:14.085
All of Project STEP's 60
students have graduated high
school, and half of them have
gone on

39:14.085 --> 39:19.057
to the country's most
prestigious Ivy League schools
or conservatories. And Jaffee
says

39:19.057 --> 39:22.794
more than half of them are now
professional musicians
themselves.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.563
Does the program change lives?

39:25.563 --> 39:29.000
MARY JAFFEE: It does change
lives. I believe it does change
lives. It's certainly changed

39:29.000 --> 39:30.368
my life.

39:30.368 --> 39:34.606
JARED BOWEN: And many others
through the power of music.

39:34.606 --> 39:41.746
This is Jared Bowen from WGBH
for the "PBS NewsHour" in
Boston.

39:41.746 --> 39:54.926
GWEN IFILL: We will be back with
a look at the American heroin
epidemic.

39:54.926 --> 39:59.130
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your local PBS
station. You can have the
opportunity

39:59.130 --> 40:08.206
to offer your support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

40:08.206 --> 40:12.443
(BREAK)

40:12.443 --> 40:18.850
Now the latest addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

40:18.850 --> 40:24.989
According to the Centers for
Disease Control, heroin usage in
the U.S. has doubled among

40:24.989 --> 40:29.894
young adults in the last decade
and deaths have quadrupled.

40:29.894 --> 40:36.067
Former Los Angeles Times
reporter Sam Quinones looks at
what's driving that surge in his

40:36.067 --> 40:40.772
new book, "Dreamland: The True
Tale of America's Opiate
Epidemic."

40:40.772 --> 40:45.843
He recently talked with Jeffrey
Brown and painted a graphic
portrait of a national problem.

40:45.843 --> 40:52.750
SAM QUINONES, Author,
"Dreamland: The True Tale of
America's Opiate Epidemic": This
is

40:52.750 --> 40:58.122
the quietest epidemic, drug
epidemic or drug scourge, we
have ever had in this country,

40:58.122 --> 41:01.259
certainly in the
last 50, 60 years.

41:01.259 --> 41:04.796
No public violence is
associated, not like crack,
where the people were battling
for

41:04.796 --> 41:11.669
street corners and this kind of
thing. People are dying alone in
their bedrooms, in a McDonald's

41:11.669 --> 41:16.574
bathroom. And there's no
publicity. Families are
stigmatized, horribly mortified
that their

41:16.574 --> 41:21.179
kids are addicted and then that
their kids die of this stuff.

41:21.179 --> 41:26.351
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this came
from reporting on the drug trade
in Mexico and the U.S. What

41:26.351 --> 41:28.886
grabbed your attention?

41:28.886 --> 41:36.494
SAM QUINONES: Well, I discovered
in the course of my reporting
the story of one small town

41:36.494 --> 41:38.996
in Mexico on the Pacific Coast,
where everybody in that town had
migrated to the United States,

41:38.996 --> 41:41.766
had developed a system
for selling heroin.

41:41.766 --> 41:46.204
They were master heroin
retailers in the United States,
selling heroin like pizza, like
delivery

41:46.204 --> 41:51.309
model. And they had used this
system to, first of all, employ
hundreds of people in the town

41:51.309 --> 41:54.979
and spread across the country,
so they were in like half the
country.

41:54.979 --> 41:58.816
What I also came to understand,
though, was that they had this
enormous market for heroin.

41:58.816 --> 42:04.889
This one small town became one
of the major suppliers of heroin
to the United States.

42:04.889 --> 42:09.794
That market was due entirely to
a whole new supply of addicts
who got addicted to prescription

42:09.794 --> 42:11.629
painkillers.

42:11.629 --> 42:15.466
JEFFREY BROWN: So it's actually
a tale of two kinds of drugs,
right, two opiates.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.635
SAM QUINONES: Two opiates.

42:17.635 --> 42:21.205
JEFFREY BROWN: One is legal in
the U.S., prescription drugs for
pain.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.707
SAM QUINONES: Right.

42:22.707 --> 42:26.244
JEFFREY BROWN: And then there's
this heroin market on top of
that.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.279
Somehow, they're linked.

42:28.279 --> 42:32.617
SAM QUINONES: Yes. And what
connects them is that this is a
new kind of drug trafficking

42:32.617 --> 42:36.521
in a sense. It's all based
on branding and marketing.

42:36.521 --> 42:40.758
It's no longer based on the old
style of gunplay and shoot-outs
for street corners and all

42:40.758 --> 42:43.261
that kind of scuff.

42:43.261 --> 42:46.431
JEFFREY BROWN: It's not the
cartels that we have been
hearing, where all the violence

42:46.431 --> 42:48.433
is.

42:48.433 --> 42:53.004
SAM QUINONES: Exactly. These are
the anti-cartels, the
anti-"Scarface," you might say.
These

42:53.004 --> 42:58.910
guys are all about low profile.
They're all about branding their
drugs, making sure that

42:58.910 --> 43:04.782
you know, every time you buy a
little 10th-of-a-gram balloon of
heroin from them, that you know

43:04.782 --> 43:11.355
exactly what's in it, that you
can call if it's no good and
have it replaced.

43:11.355 --> 43:17.128
At the same time, though, the
companies that promoted the
pills have also used branding

43:17.128 --> 43:20.631
and marketing to convince
doctors all across America that
these pills can be used without

43:20.631 --> 43:21.699
risk, without risk of addiction,
virtually nonaddictive when used
to address...

43:21.699 --> 43:23.601
(CROSSTALK)

43:23.601 --> 43:27.138
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that is
where the story starts in the
U.S., right, is the rise of

43:27.138 --> 43:28.940
these kinds of pills that many
people are familiar with,
whether you're an athlete or

43:28.940 --> 43:30.575
any -- all kinds
of people, right?

43:30.575 --> 43:32.977
SAM QUINONES: Sure. Right.

43:32.977 --> 43:36.981
JEFFREY BROWN: Pain, you get
prescribed these kinds of pills.
And you were told that they

43:36.981 --> 43:39.784
were nonaddictive, or
mostly not addictive.

43:39.784 --> 43:44.322
SAM QUINONES: You were told they
were nonaddictive, or you
weren't told anything. You were
just

43:44.322 --> 43:49.660
given a big whack of pills. I
had my appendix out, they gave
me 60 Vicodin to take home.

43:49.660 --> 43:52.530
The message in that bottle was,
doesn't matter how many of these
you take. It's not going

43:52.530 --> 43:55.066
to addict you.

43:55.066 --> 44:04.308
You're not -- they didn't tell
me anything about what was in
them. I think is kind of

44:04.308 --> 44:09.780
common practice all across the
country because of this pain
revolution that took place in

44:09.780 --> 44:14.452
the '80s and well into the '90s,
gaining a lot of momentum then.

44:14.452 --> 44:17.321
JEFFREY BROWN: Much of it to
benefit to people, right?

44:17.321 --> 44:21.025
SAM QUINONES: Of course. No,
these are legitimate pills, and
many people use them to great
benefit.

44:21.025 --> 44:26.664
And it has assuaged the pain of
many, many people, chronic pain,
as well as post-surgical

44:26.664 --> 44:29.133
pain.

44:29.133 --> 44:34.739
The problem is, there is not a
lot of attempt to just determine
who should be taking them,

44:34.739 --> 44:48.052
how many pills they should take
home with them. And there is not
a lot of time spent

44:48.052 --> 45:07.438
by doctors on dealing with maybe
a patient's history of
addiction, say, in the past,
what

45:07.438 --> 45:16.113
-- do you have any addiction,
history of alcoholism?

45:16.113 --> 45:20.484
JEFFREY BROWN: And what's been
the result? This is -- you
describe it, throughout Middle

45:20.484 --> 45:21.118
America especially.

45:21.118 --> 45:22.887
SAM QUINONES: Right.

45:22.887 --> 45:25.623
JEFFREY BROWN: An epidemic?
What do you see?

45:25.623 --> 45:28.893
SAM QUINONES: I see epidemic.

45:28.893 --> 45:34.966
I see a scourge that has
attacked communities that are
completely unprepared for this.
They

45:34.966 --> 45:41.439
have never seen anything like
it. It's families who never
really had this kind of
addiction

45:41.439 --> 45:45.943
to hard drugs ever in their
lives. It's hitting rural areas.
It's hitting suburban areas.

45:45.943 --> 45:52.116
Athletes -- it now seems to me,
frankly, that at times football
is almost a gateway to heroin

45:52.116 --> 45:56.487
addiction, because so many
football players are treated for
their chronic pain with these

45:56.487 --> 46:00.391
pills. They then get addicted
and eventually -- if it's not
treated, eventually, you have

46:00.391 --> 46:05.863
to transition to heroin
after using these pills.

46:05.863 --> 46:10.601
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what kind of
awareness is there now, either
in the medical community,

46:10.601 --> 46:15.573
in government? What
is or could be done?

46:15.573 --> 46:39.130
SAM QUINONES: I think what needs
to be happen is very much what
began happening with the AIDS
epidemic, and

46:39.130 --> 46:45.936
that is a recognition and
talking a lot about it, removing
that stigma.

46:45.936 --> 46:59.183
Once you remove it, then people
who get -- who are new to it can
figure out what their kids

46:59.183 --> 47:16.434
need. But that's what has not
happened. That's why I think it
has spread.

47:16.434 --> 47:43.594
JEFFREY BROWN: All
right, the book

47:43.594 --> 47:48.899
is "Dreamland."

47:48.899 --> 48:05.549
Sam Quinones, thank you so much.

48:05.549 --> 48:20.965
SAM QUINONES: My
pleasure. Thank you.

48:20.965 --> 48:48.626
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Almost everyone makes
one big mistake when negotiating

48:48.626 --> 49:22.626
a higher salary, says jobs guru
Nick Corcodilos. But there's a
surefire way to elegantly open
that conversation

49:22.626 --> 49:49.587
with potential employers. If you
want more money, you have to
prove why you're worth more, he
says.

49:49.587 --> 50:04.068
On our Making Sense page, he
explains just how to do that.

50:04.068 --> 50:17.248
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:17.248 --> 50:26.724
Have you read it?

50:26.724 --> 50:49.380
GWEN IFILL: I think I know I
have made that big -- one
mistake, and I'm looking for

50:49.380 --> 50:53.617
the elegant solution, so
I will be logging on.

50:53.617 --> 50:54.551
(LAUGHTER)

50:54.551 --> 51:02.393
GWEN IFILL: That's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

51:02.393 --> 53:33.577
On Thursday: an inside
look at the fight to

53:33.577 --> 53:35.746
take down the Islamic
State in Syria.

53:35.746 --> 53:36.880
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.583
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:39.583 --> 53:43.020
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:43.020 --> 54:36.974
thank you, and good night.
