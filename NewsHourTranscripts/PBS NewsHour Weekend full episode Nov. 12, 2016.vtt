BE ATTRACTIVE TO REPUBLICANS.

BUT THE STICKING POINT FOR MANY

SO, YOU KNOW, INTERESTINGLY

10:58.191 --> 10:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

MANY DEMOCRATS, THE EXTENT TO

11:02.962 --> 11:04.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES

11:04.197 --> 11:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS IS AN

11:05.899 --> 11:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION BECAUSE

11:06.766 --> 11:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THEIR VIEW, THE TYPES OF

PROJECTS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO

BE BUILT WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDING

11:11.871 --> 11:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THE ONES LEAST LIKELY TO BE

11:13.540 --> 11:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILT BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND,

11:15.608 --> 11:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEREFORE, THE MOST LIKELY TO

11:16.609 --> 11:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATE NEW JOBS.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO BUILD AND IT'S JUST MORE

11:23.516 --> 11:25.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFITABLE FOR THEM TO DO SO,

11:25.118 --> 11:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU DON'T CREATE A LOT OF JOBS

BY TO GO THAT.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IF, HOWEVER, WHAT YOU'RE DOING

11:32.225 --> 11:33.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PROVIDING FUNDING FOR

11:33.960 --> 11:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECTS THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE

JOBS.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS OUR BIGGEST FEAR.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS BASICALLY HAVE TO BE

16:31.424 --> 16:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED BY ALL PARTY TO THIS

16:34.660 --> 16:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFLICT AND WE NEED TO ENSURE

16:37.263 --> 16:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIAN SAFETY IS THE MOST

16:38.564 --> 16:39.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT PRIORITY.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE CONCERNED.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE SEEN CIVILIAN CASUALTIES

16:42.335 --> 16:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS

16:43.436 --> 16:44.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T REPEAT AGAIN.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL IS ABOUT A MONTH OLD AT

16:48.074 --> 16:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS POINT.

BEING EXECUTED, CIVILIANS, AND

16:55.081 --> 16:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING LABELED AS "TRAITORS" AND

16:56.849 --> 16:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING KILLED AS A BETRAYAL.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AND YET PUBLIC EXECUTION OF

17:08.461 --> 17:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS THEY HAVE

17:10.029 --> 17:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN RULING WITH AN IRON FIST IN

17:11.764 --> 17:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MOSUL AREA, ALL AREAS UNDER

17:13.399 --> 17:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR CONTROL.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF CASES

17:15.468 --> 17:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HEARD ABOUT A NUMBER OF

17:16.903 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES OF CIVILIANS BEING

17:18.604 --> 17:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTED FOR AS LITTLE AS HAVING

17:21.040 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWE MOBILE PHONE.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A FEAR, MOST OF THE

17:23.042 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE IN THE CITY OR SOME

17:24.043 --> 17:26.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE IN THE CITY ARE ACTUALLY

17:26.045 --> 17:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOPERATING WITH THE SECURITY

17:26.979 --> 17:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES SO THEY'RE USING THIS

17:27.980 --> 17:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

17:28.814 --> 17:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO

17:31.150 --> 17:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER ORGANIZE A COUP OR TRY TO

17:34.553 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE

17:35.554 --> 17:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY FORCES THAT THEY WILL

BE KILLED.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO OUR CONCERN, AGAIN, GOES FOR

17:38.424 --> 17:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF

17:39.458 --> 17:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE TRAPPED RIGHT NOW, AND

17:42.094 --> 17:43.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIGHTING IS COMING CLOSE.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY'RE SEEING A LOT MORE--

17:46.165 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE HEARING A LOT MORE

17:47.633 --> 17:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLOSIONS.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE MOSUL

17:52.638 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY AND THE POPULATION OF THE

17:53.639 --> 17:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY IS TERRIFIED.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING TWO YEARS

17:54.907 --> 17:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER THEIR RULE AND THEY WOULD

17:56.208 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED A LOT OF ASSISTANCE,

17:57.343 --> 17:58.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESPECIALLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH,

17:58.778 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:41.854 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE 13 TRUE/FALSE STATEMENTS?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT IS THE RULE THAT

18:46.225 --> 18:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETERMINES THE OUTCOME?

18:47.727 --> 18:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I CAME ACROSS THE KEYS TO THE

18:48.995 --> 18:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE TOTALLY BY ACCIDENT.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LEADING AUTHORITY IN EARTHQUAKE

PREDICTION.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WAS HE WHO SUGGESTED WE

19:02.108 --> 19:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLABORATE USING HIS

AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE STUDIED EVERY AMERICAN

19:11.117 --> 19:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION FROM 1860 TO 1980.

19:13.386 --> 19:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS IN 1981, GUIDED BY THE

19:17.456 --> 19:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESIS THAT SAYS PRESIDENTIAL

19:18.724 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS ARE PRIMARILY

19:21.894 --> 19:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE WHITE HOUSE.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FROM THAT STUDY, WE CAME UP

19:27.133 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH 13 SIMPLE, TRUE/FALSE

19:31.470 --> 19:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS, WHERE AN ANSWER OF

19:34.206 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"TRUE" ALWAYS FAVORS THE

19:35.474 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RE-ELECTION OF THE WHITE HOUSE

19:36.175 --> 19:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTY.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE CAME UP WITH A REALLY

19:38.177 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMPLE DECISION RULE: IF SIX OR

19:40.546 --> 19:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE OF THE KEYS ARE FALSE, THAT

19:42.248 --> 19:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BODES DEFEAT FOR THE PARTY

19:44.050 --> 19:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLDING THE WHITE HOUSE.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WELL, LET'S LOOK

19:46.419 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THOSE FIRST FOUR RULES, THOSE

19:48.521 --> 19:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEYS, BECAUSE THEY'RE BASICALLY

19:49.822 --> 19:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT POLITICAL CLIMATE, AS YOU

19:51.690 --> 19:52.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID, SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN,

19:52.591 --> 19:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, OBJECTIVELY TAKE A

19:54.126 --> 19:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT.

19:55.327 --> 19:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE FALSE.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE INCUMBENT PARTY, FOR THE

19:58.197 --> 19:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT WERE THE OTHER TWO THAT

20:01.400 --> 20:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENT IT OVER THE EDGE FOR THE

20:02.735 --> 20:03.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS?

20:03.135 --> 20:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> CRITICALLY, THE PARTY HOLDING

20:05.905 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT ACHIEVE

20:11.077 --> 20:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAJOR POLICY CHANGE IN THE

20:12.912 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECOND OBAMA TERM.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE A BIG

20:16.615 --> 20:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOMESTIC ACCOMPLISHMENT TO RUN

20:17.550 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ADDITION, THEY DIDN'T ACHIEVE

20:19.952 --> 20:22.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BIG, FLASHY FOREIGN POLICY

20:22.755 --> 20:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCCESS.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: YOUR MODEL TAKES

20:24.090 --> 20:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERIC

20:26.258 --> 20:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND THE

20:28.094 --> 20:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERIC DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A

20:30.563 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERIC REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE

20:31.330 --> 20:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TIME AROUND.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHY DO YOU THINK IT WORKS

20:35.734 --> 20:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE FORCE OF HISTORY IS

20:37.336 --> 20:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY POWERFUL.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A VERY ROBUST MODEL

20:40.739 --> 20:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT GOES RETROSPECTIVELY

20:42.608 --> 20:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO 1860 AND PROSPECTIVELY

20:46.078 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AHEAD TO THE PRESENT.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
