GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. JUDY WOODRUFF: And

00:04.738 --> 00:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Judy Woodruff. On the
"NewsHour" tonight: A new

00:08.976 --> 00:12.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political divide? How Republican
leaders are distancing

00:12.379 --> 00:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves from the party's
front-runner. GWEN IFILL: Also

00:15.682 --> 00:19.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead this Wednesday: As racial
tensions on college campuses

00:19.286 --> 00:23.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remain high, affirmative action
is once again before the Supreme

00:23.490 --> 00:26.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Court. JUDY WOODRUFF: And we
hear we shouldn't trust them,

00:26.960 --> 00:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but how accurate are political
polls and what should we read

00:31.632 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into them? BILL MCINTURFF,
Partner and Co-Founder, Public

00:33.634 --> 00:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Opinion Strategies: I don't
think Peter and I, or any

00:35.636 --> 00:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pollster, would tell you that a
poll today has much or any

00:39.373 --> 00:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
predictive power for what
October of 2016 will look like.

00:43.176 --> 00:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:46.546 --> 00:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(BREAK) JUDY WOODRUFF: The FBI
now says the shooters who killed

01:02.963 --> 01:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
14 people in San Bernardino,
California, had talked of

01:06.900 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence as far back as 2013.
That's a year before they were

01:11.672 --> 01:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
married. At a Senate hearing
today, FBI Director James Comey

01:16.043 --> 01:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said investigators are piecing
together a timeline on Syed

01:20.247 --> 01:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Farook and Tashfeen Malik. JAMES
COMEY, FBI Director: They were

01:23.216 --> 01:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually radicalized before they
started courting or dating each

01:28.055 --> 01:32.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other online. As early as the
end of 2013, they were talking

01:32.092 --> 01:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to each other about jihad and
martyrdom, before they became

01:35.262 --> 01:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
engaged and then married and
lived together in the United

01:37.965 --> 01:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States. JUDY WOODRUFF: It's also
reported that Syed Farook may

01:41.501 --> 01:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have plotted an attack in 2012
with a neighbor who bought the

01:45.339 --> 01:48.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assault rifles used last week.
The neighbor has checked himself

01:48.942 --> 01:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a mental clinic. GWEN
IFILL: The man accused of

01:51.645 --> 01:55.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacking a Planned Parenthood
clinic in Colorado blurted out

01:55.349 --> 01:59.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today that he's guilty. Robert
Lewis Dear repeatedly voiced

01:59.653 --> 02:02.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-abortion sentiments during
a hearing. At one point, he

02:02.789 --> 02:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shouted: "I'm guilty. I'm a
warrior for the babies." Three

02:06.827 --> 02:10.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people died in the shootings
last month. Meanwhile, a

02:10.163 --> 02:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baltimore policeman accused in
the Freddie Gray case testified

02:13.800 --> 02:17.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his own defense today against
a manslaughter charge. Gray was

02:17.838 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fatally injured during a ride in
a police van last April in an

02:21.675 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incident that touched off
violent protests. Officer

02:24.911 --> 02:28.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Porter told the court he
checked on Gray several times

02:28.415 --> 02:31.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and saw no sign of injury. And
he said: "I didn't call for a

02:31.985 --> 02:36.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
medic because Gray was unable to
give me a reason for a medical

02:36.790 --> 02:39.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emergency." JUDY WOODRUFF:
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has

02:39.993 --> 02:43.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
apologized for the shooting
death of 17-year-old Laquan

02:43.530 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McDonald at the hands of police,
saying he takes responsibility

02:47.501 --> 02:50.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it happened -- quote --
"on his watch." Video of the

02:51.004 --> 02:55.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2014 incident came out last
week, and now a white officer is

02:55.675 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charged with murder. Emanuel
told the Chicago City Council

02:59.513 --> 03:02.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today that the police department
must undertake complete and

03:02.516 --> 03:06.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
total reform. RAHM EMANUEL (D),
Mayor of Chicago: No officer

03:06.386 --> 03:11.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be allowed to behave as
if they are above the law just

03:12.025 --> 03:17.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they are responsible for
upholding the law. Permitting

03:19.166 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and protecting even the smallest
acts of abuse by a tiny fraction

03:25.338 --> 03:30.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of our officers leads to a
culture where extreme acts of

03:30.143 --> 03:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abuse are more likely. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Hundreds of protesters

03:34.748 --> 03:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
flooded downtown streets in
Chicago today, accusing Emanuel

03:39.186 --> 03:42.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a cover-up. They blocked
traffic and demanded that the

03:42.456 --> 03:46.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mayor step down. GWEN IFILL: The
U.S. military is poised to do

03:46.526 --> 03:50.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more to help Iraq recapture a
key city from Islamic State

03:50.263 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
control. Iraqi government forces
have now encircled Ramadi, the

03:54.201 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capital of Anbar province, and
are slowly moving in. Defense

03:57.771 --> 04:00.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Ash Carter told a
Senate panel today that the U.S.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stands ready to help finish the
job. ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense

04:03.877 --> 04:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary: The United States is
prepared to assist the Iraqi

04:06.813 --> 04:10.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
army with additional unique
capabilities to help them finish

04:10.250 --> 04:13.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the job, including attack
helicopters and accompanying

04:13.887 --> 04:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advisers, if circumstances
dictate and if requested by

04:17.491 --> 04:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prime Minister Abadi. GWEN
IFILL: Later, the White House

04:20.026 --> 04:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said President Obama has not yet
approved the use of U.S. attack

04:23.697 --> 04:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helicopters in Iraq. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, in Syria,

04:27.567 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the last of the rebel stronghold
of Homs has officially fallen to

04:31.872 --> 04:35.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government troops. Rebel
factions pulled out today, under

04:35.408 --> 04:40.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a local truce. Scores of people,
including gunmen and civilians,

04:40.213 --> 04:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left the city in bus convoys
organized by the United Nations

04:44.317 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Red Crescent. The city had
been under siege by the Syrian

04:48.121 --> 04:52.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military for three years. GWEN
IFILL: Afghanistan's military

04:52.125 --> 04:55.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggled today to beat back a
Taliban attack on an air base in

04:55.929 --> 04:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the south. A gun battle raged
into the night outside the city

04:59.466 --> 05:03.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Kandahar, killing and
wounding dozens of people.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News filed this

05:06.373 --> 05:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report. JONATHAN MILLER: We now
know that at least 37 civilians

05:11.978 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Afghan soldiers were killed
and 35 wounded when Taliban

05:16.683 --> 05:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insurgents stormed the heavily
fortified complex, taking up

05:20.654 --> 05:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
position in a residential
section, home to hundreds of

05:23.890 --> 05:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NATO and other international
personnel. This morning, this

05:27.894 --> 05:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airport employee said the
security forces weren't letting

05:32.265 --> 05:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anyone onto the base yet, as the
fighting was still raging. The

05:38.805 --> 05:44.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Taliban released this video of
what they claimed were the

05:44.277 --> 05:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insurgents who attacked the
Kandahar base. Their leader,

05:48.381 --> 05:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speaking in English, warned
President Obama to get remaining

05:52.886 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.
MAN: This my suggestion, Barack

05:58.124 --> 06:02.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama. Obama, you are not safe
in Afghanistan. JONATHAN MILLER:

06:02.829 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He threatened to kill foreign
soldiers of what the Talibs call

06:06.566 --> 06:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Afghan slave army. This
photograph shows the same men,

06:11.705 --> 06:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same backdrop, this time dressed
in Afghan army uniform and

06:16.343 --> 06:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wielding Kalashnikovs. The
identity of one of the 10 is

06:19.813 --> 06:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obscured. It's possible that he
didn't join the operation.

06:23.083 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghan forces claim to have
killed 14 insurgents. Gruesome

06:28.855 --> 06:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pictures released tonight show
Afghan soldiers displaying the

06:32.892 --> 06:36.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dead bodies of the attackers and
their weapons to TV cameras.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Afghanistan's
President Ashraf Ghani was in

06:40.433 --> 06:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pakistan today, discussing
possible peace talks with the

06:43.637 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Taliban. JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in
this country, a sweeping

06:47.040 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
makeover of public education law
cleared Congress today. The

06:50.910 --> 06:54.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate gave final approval to
the rewrite of the No Child Left

06:54.614 --> 06:58.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Behind law. It shifts more
decision-making to the States on

06:58.618 --> 07:02.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to assess teachers and
schools, but it still requires

07:02.255 --> 07:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
annual testing in reading and
math. GWEN IFILL: Another night

07:06.159 --> 07:09.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of heavy rain has spread
flooding across more of the

07:09.296 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pacific Northwest. Storms in
Oregon and Washington state

07:13.099 --> 07:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knocked out power to nearly
100,000 customers. In Portland,

07:16.970 --> 07:20.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a tree crashed into a home,
killing a 60-year-old woman. And

07:20.707 --> 07:24.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just south of Seattle, cars and
trucks struggled to make their

07:24.177 --> 07:28.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way through high water that
closed a number of roads. JUDY

07:28.081 --> 07:31.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Volkswagen now says
that one of its emissions

07:31.284 --> 07:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scandals may not be as bad as
first believed. Company

07:35.188 --> 07:38.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials initially said they
might have low-balled carbon

07:38.091 --> 07:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dioxide emissions in 800,000
vehicles. Now they say it's more

07:43.263 --> 07:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like 36,000. V.W. still faces a
much larger scandal over

07:48.068 --> 07:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cheating on U.S. emissions
tests. GWEN IFILL: On Wall

07:51.604 --> 07:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street today, the Dow Jones
industrial average lost 75

07:55.075 --> 08:01.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points to close back near 17490.
The Nasdaq also fell 75, and the

08:01.114 --> 08:06.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 dropped 16. JUDY
WOODRUFF: And it was 150 years

08:06.486 --> 08:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago this month that the 13th
Amendment was ratified and

08:10.123 --> 08:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slavery was abolished in the
United States. President Obama

08:13.760 --> 08:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marked the occasion at the U.S.
Capitol, and he appeared to

08:17.030 --> 08:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
target Donald Trump's call to
bar Muslims from entering the

08:21.368 --> 08:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country. BARACK OBAMA, President
of the United States: We betray

08:24.838 --> 08:29.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the efforts of the past if we
fail to push back against

08:29.142 --> 08:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bigotry in all its forms. Our
freedom is bound up with the

08:34.381 --> 08:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freedom of others, regardless of
what they look like, or where

08:39.486 --> 08:42.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they come from, or what their
last name is, or what faith they

08:42.856 --> 08:45.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
practice. (CHEERING AND
APPLAUSE) JUDY WOODRUFF: That

08:45.725 --> 08:49.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drew a standing ovation from the
gathered congressional leaders.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the White House said the
remarks were not specifically

08:52.332 --> 08:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
directed at Trump. We will focus
on how Republicans are reacting

08:56.770 --> 09:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Trump in just a moment. GWEN
IFILL: Also ahead on the

09:01.107 --> 09:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour": race in college
admissions back at the Supreme

09:05.211 --> 09:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Court; exactly how accurate are
election polls; and much more.

09:09.382 --> 09:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
divisions and dilemmas inside

09:29.903 --> 09:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican Party. There's
growing GOP opposition to Donald

09:33.907 --> 09:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump, the front-runner in the
race for the White House,

09:37.010 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially since his latest
comments on denying Muslims

09:40.447 --> 09:43.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entry into this country. What do
these divisions mean for

09:43.750 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans and their leaders?
We explore that with former

09:46.986 --> 09:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Minnesota Congressman Vin Weber.
For the record, he's formally

09:50.757 --> 09:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
endorsed Jeb Bush. And Jonathan
Martin, national political

09:54.561 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent for The New York
Times. And welcome to both of

09:57.730 --> 10:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you. VIN WEBER, Former U.S.
Congressman: Thank you, Judy.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Jonathan, let
me start with you. You were in

10:03.970 --> 10:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
South Carolina on Monday night,
when Donald Trump made those

10:05.972 --> 10:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comments about Muslims. First of
all, remind us, what was the

10:07.974 --> 10:10.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction in the room where he
spoke, and then what's been the

10:10.877 --> 10:13.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction since then? JONATHAN
MARTIN, National Political

10:13.980 --> 10:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent, The New York
Times: Quite enthusiastic from

10:20.920 --> 10:25.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his supporters, a lot of
applause, a sort of prolonged

10:25.625 --> 10:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ovation, many folks standing up,
some yells. There was approval.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I talked to many of them
afterwards, too, and I think it

10:29.629 --> 10:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was easy to find people in that
crowd that supported Mr. Trump's

10:31.631 --> 10:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan. If you dig a little bit
deeper, though, you can find

10:33.633 --> 10:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some people that I think want to
see the border tightened and

10:35.635 --> 10:37.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want to see immigration
tightened, want to see more

10:37.637 --> 10:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vetting towards those coming
into the country, but are a

10:39.639 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little bit leery about going as
far as Trump plans. So I don't

10:43.376 --> 10:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it's as sort of cut and
dried as perhaps the crowd

10:47.180 --> 10:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction may have been in real
time. But, obviously, in the

10:50.149 --> 10:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days since then, there is deep
concern in the party about the

10:53.119 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
implications of this, barring an
entire faith of folks coming

10:56.289 --> 10:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the country, and the
concern is not just the fact

10:59.559 --> 11:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's Trump saying these
bombastic things. It's the

11:02.228 --> 11:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fallout that could hurt the
party on down-ballot next year,

11:05.164 --> 11:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too, Judy. JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Vin Weber, we have pointed out

11:08.268 --> 11:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have endorsed Jeb Bush. But
you also... VIN WEBER: A long

11:11.204 --> 11:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time ago. JUDY WOODRUFF: A long
time ago. But you talk to

11:14.173 --> 11:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans about the country.
What are picking up? VIN WEBER:

11:17.277 --> 11:19.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know of a single
Republican leader that is not

11:19.712 --> 11:23.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appalled at what Donald Trump is
saying, and I don't know of a

11:23.449 --> 11:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
single Republican strategist
that doesn't think he poses a

11:26.185 --> 11:30.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
huge threat to the Republican
Party, increasingly so, whether

11:30.690 --> 11:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he wins or loses. And that's a
great, great concern. At the

11:34.427 --> 11:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grassroots level, you know, it's
a mixed bag, as Jonathan points

11:37.964 --> 11:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out. I think Trump is a classic
demagogue, and the demagogue

11:42.769 --> 11:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
succeeds by preying on the
fears, legitimate fears

11:46.172 --> 11:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sometimes, that people have, and
they respond. JUDY WOODRUFF:

11:48.808 --> 11:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it that the opposition
is born out of? Is it just -- is

11:52.111 --> 11:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it this comment about Muslims?
Because there have been so many

11:54.681 --> 11:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other comments he has made that
have been controversial. What's

11:57.850 --> 12:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generating this? VIN WEBER: You
reach a tipping point, I think.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you had his comments
about Mexican Americans. You had

12:03.723 --> 12:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his comments about disabled
people. You had his comments

12:06.526 --> 12:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about McCain, which can be
extrapolated to veteran. And now

12:10.196 --> 12:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have the comments about
Muslim Americans. And this is

12:12.999 --> 12:16.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of the one that went over
the edge and convinced people

12:16.169 --> 12:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is a real serious threat to
brand the Republican Party as a

12:19.839 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
party of bigotry and
intolerance. And, again, I want

12:22.709 --> 12:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to emphasize, no Republican
leader that I am aware of shares

12:25.445 --> 12:28.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
any of these views. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Jonathan Martin,

12:28.381 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're, again, obviously,
talking to Republicans. JONATHAN

12:30.883 --> 12:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN: Yes. JUDY WOODRUFF:
What's the genesis? What's

12:32.885 --> 12:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind this concern? Is that
they're concerned he's going to

12:36.155 --> 12:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win the nomination? JONATHAN
MARTIN: Yes. JUDY WOODRUFF: Is

12:39.692 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it concern that he will leave
the party and go run as an

12:44.030 --> 12:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
independent? I mean, what is...
JONATHAN MARTIN: I think it's

12:46.833 --> 12:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both of those factors, and a
third one. It's that, nominee or

12:50.336 --> 12:52.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not, as Vin said, the fallout
from this is going to have an

12:52.905 --> 12:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
impact on the Republican Party,
because these comments are going

12:56.142 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be linked to candidates next
year. Look, I think, for months,

12:58.144 --> 13:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there was frankly widespread
denial in the Republican Party

13:00.146 --> 13:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Trump could be the nominee
or that Trump was formidable. It

13:02.148 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was the summer of Trump. Folks
said, oh, this will be a passing

13:04.183 --> 13:06.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fancy. Well, here it is, we're
coming up on Christmas, and he

13:06.919 --> 13:09.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still overwhelmingly the
front-runner for his party's

13:09.622 --> 13:12.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nomination. And I think you
finally see people in the party

13:12.925 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming to terms with that, right
when he sort of ups the rhetoric

13:16.062 --> 13:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level to new heights. And that's
the concern. JUDY WOODRUFF: But

13:19.832 --> 13:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is it more -- excuse me -- is it
more that they think they're

13:22.735 --> 13:25.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worried that he will go on to
win the election and become

13:25.571 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president and will impose his
ideas, or is it they're worried

13:28.741 --> 13:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he would lose to the
Democrats? JONATHAN MARTIN: Oh,

13:31.177 --> 13:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's the latter. It's not that
he's going to be president. It's

13:33.212 --> 13:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he could either be the
nominee and cause a landslide

13:36.649 --> 13:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wipeout for the party, where he
would lose... VIN WEBER: Or lose

13:38.651 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nomination and split the
party. JONATHAN MARTIN: Right.

13:41.621 --> 13:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or go to the convention next
summer and offer some kind of

13:45.324 --> 13:48.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demands or give more speeches
that hurt the party. There's a

13:48.394 --> 13:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of scenarios, none of them
very good for the GOP. VIN

13:51.798 --> 13:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WEBER: And all of this, by the
way, coming from somebody whose

13:55.068 --> 13:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican credentials are very
thin. Everybody else running for

13:57.537 --> 14:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican nomination has
some right to say they are more

14:00.573 --> 14:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or less lifelong Republicans.
Donald Trump has kind of picked

14:03.309 --> 14:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this party as his vehicle. He's
really not a Republican.

14:06.546 --> 14:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN MARTIN: But what's
stunning, Judy, is that nobody

14:11.150 --> 14:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is hitting him on that or
anything else about his

14:14.353 --> 14:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comments, his background in
business, his previous political

14:17.223 --> 14:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stances. He is untouched. JUDY
WOODRUFF: You mean on the other

14:19.225 --> 14:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parts of his resume. Is that
what you mean? (CROSSTALK)

14:21.227 --> 14:23.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN MARTIN: Well, exactly.
(CROSSTALK) VIN WEBER: Jonathan,

14:23.229 --> 14:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let me -- we have got to give
credit where credit is due. I

14:25.231 --> 14:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will say one very positive
thing. Paul Ryan did a really

14:27.233 --> 14:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good thing for our party today.
He didn't have to speak on this

14:29.235 --> 14:31.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
subject. He said that he didn't
have to speak on it. He chose to

14:31.237 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speak on it, and he spoke very
well. (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF:

14:33.239 --> 14:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yesterday. You mean about the
Muslim... (CROSSTALK) VIN WEBER:

14:35.241 --> 14:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yesterday, about the Muslim
comments. JONATHAN MARTIN: But

14:37.243 --> 14:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm talking about a sustained
effort to go after Donald Trump

14:39.245 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on TV in places like Iowa and
New Hampshire. Look, in 2003,

14:41.547 --> 14:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats were concerned about
Howard Dean losing to George

14:44.784 --> 14:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bush. VIN WEBER: Right. JONATHAN
MARTIN: And they went after him

14:49.689 --> 14:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a very aggressive way. This
is comparable to that, but I

14:53.259 --> 14:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think the threat that Trump
poses is much more serious than

14:55.261 --> 14:57.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dean. And where's the money? VIN
WEBER: But the Democrats had one

14:57.263 --> 14:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear alternative, John Kerry,
who ultimately got the

14:59.265 --> 15:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nomination. Part of our problem
on the Republican side is, there

15:01.267 --> 15:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not one clear alternative to
get behind. I'm for Bush, but I

15:03.870 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't say he's the only
alternative. JUDY WOODRUFF: What

15:05.872 --> 15:07.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the fact that these
crowds, as Jonathan just

15:07.874 --> 15:11.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
described, that Trump is
drawing, they appear to agree

15:11.110 --> 15:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with what -- and there was a new
poll out today that Bloomberg

15:14.247 --> 15:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
News -- that was reported on
that indicates there's a large

15:18.684 --> 15:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percentage of voters who agree,
Republican voters who agree with

15:22.822 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what Donald Trump is saying
about Muslims? How is the party

15:26.192 --> 15:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dealing with that? VIN WEBER:
That's very troublesome, beyond

15:28.394 --> 15:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troublesome. I have to say that
it -- you know what? The only

15:31.964 --> 15:35.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way that you can beat a
demagogue, which is what he is,

15:35.268 --> 15:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to have a strong message of
leadership from someone else,

15:38.304 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether the someone else is a
Republican alternative or the

15:41.274 --> 15:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president of the United States.
And so far, those voters are not

15:47.180 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hearing a strong enough message,
strong enough, responsible

15:49.182 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message to sort of overshadow
the strong demagogic message

15:51.584 --> 15:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming out of Donald Trump.
JONATHAN MARTIN: And I think,

15:55.421 --> 15:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also, those numbers, Judy,
explain some of the reluctance

15:59.258 --> 16:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among the other candidates to go
after him that hard. It's a hard

16:02.495 --> 16:05.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reality for the party to
swallow, but... JUDY WOODRUFF:

16:05.598 --> 16:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some have, and some have been
less vigorous. JONATHAN MARTIN:

16:08.000 --> 16:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. But it's a hard reality for
the party to swallow. A lot of

16:10.002 --> 16:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their grassroots voters in fact
support these kind of ideas. VIN

And we will leave it there,

16:14.006 --> 16:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue to watch it. Jonathan

GWEN IFILL: The Supreme Court
returned today to the hotly

16:29.689 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debated, recurring dispute over
race in college admissions. The

16:33.926 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question whether affirmative
action is constitutional has

16:37.663 --> 16:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
played out before the nation's
high court before. For the

16:41.734 --> 16:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
second time in three years, the
justices are considering whether

16:45.705 --> 16:49.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is constitutional for
universities to consider race in

16:49.642 --> 16:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
admissions. The lawsuit, then
and now, was brought by Abigail

16:53.946 --> 16:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fisher, a white student from
Texas who was denied admission

16:57.450 --> 17:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the University of Texas at
Austin in 2008. ABIGAIL FISHER,

17:01.320 --> 17:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plaintiff: Like most Americans,
I don't believe that students

17:04.757 --> 17:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be treated differently
based on their race. Hopefully,

17:10.029 --> 17:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this race -- this case will end
racial classifications and

17:13.432 --> 17:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preferences in admissions at the
University of Texas. GWEN IFILL:

17:17.203 --> 17:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fisher's case reached the high
court the first time in 2012.

17:21.173 --> 17:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justices sent it back to the
lower court for further review.

She went on to graduate from

17:28.614 --> 17:32.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she never dropped her challenge
to U.T.'s policy, which admits

17:32.485 --> 17:36.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every Texan who ranks in the top
10 percent of their class. For

17:36.389 --> 17:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rest of the class, about 25
percent, race can be taken into

,FMD-BO,OØGREG FENVES, President,
University of Texas: This

17:46.666 --> 17:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
morning, we argued before the
Supreme Court that universities

17:48.668 --> 17:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a compelling interest in
the educational benefits of

17:50.670 --> 17:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diversity and that our use of
race and ethnicity in the U.T.'s

17:53.806 --> 17:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holistic admissions process is
narrow, is constitutional, and

17:58.577 --> 18:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is in the best interest of our
state and the nation. GWEN

18:01.280 --> 18:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: The lower court ruled in
favor of the university again

18:04.183 --> 18:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last year, prompting the Supreme
Court to take the case up again.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The court has weighed in on
affirmative action before. In

18:11.424 --> 18:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2003, it decided 5-4 to allow
the University of Michigan Law

18:16.329 --> 18:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
School to use race as one factor
in its admissions process. But

18:21.367 --> 18:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eight states have now banned the
use of race altogether as a

18:24.570 --> 18:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factor in admissions. Eight,
instead of nine, justices will

18:28.507 --> 18:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decide this case. Elena Kagan,
who defended affirmative action

18:32.545 --> 18:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as President Obama's solicitor
general, has recused herself and

18:36.682 --> 18:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will not participate. We're
joined now by two people of

18:40.419 --> 18:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opposing views who listened to
the arguments at the court

18:43.356 --> 18:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today. Janai Nelson, associate
director counsel of the NAACP

Kahlenberg, senior fellow at the

you both. RICHARD KAHLENBERG,

you. JANAI NELSON, NAACP Legal

Defense Fund: Thank you. GWEN
IFILL: You were both in the

18:59.705 --> 19:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court today. Presumably, you
have been following this case

19:01.707 --> 19:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very closely for some time. What
was different today than we saw

19:03.709 --> 19:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last time? RICHARD KAHLENBERG:
Well, I think there's a lot of

19:05.711 --> 19:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
similarity to what we saw last
time. I think University of

19:07.713 --> 19:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Texas is in deep trouble with
its defense of the racial

19:09.715 --> 19:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preference programs. There's
broad agreement in the court

19:13.419 --> 19:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that diversity is a valuable
thing. That's certainly

19:16.088 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something I believe in, but
there's a big disagreement on

19:19.492 --> 19:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to get there. Should we use
race explicitly in our

19:23.429 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
admissions policies, or should
we do alternatives, such as

19:27.900 --> 19:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
giving a leg up to economically
disadvantaged students? And,

19:31.570 --> 19:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, you heard Justice Alito,
in particular, I thought was

19:36.342 --> 19:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite powerful in arguing that
the alternatives are a better

19:40.880 --> 19:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way of getting racial diversity.
Texas is in this awkward

19:45.684 --> 19:50.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
position because the top 10
percent plan did produce a lot

19:50.990 --> 19:53.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of racial and ethnic diversity.
So they're in this awkward

19:53.993 --> 19:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
position of having to argue,
well, there's something wrong

19:57.129 --> 20:04.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the top 10 percent
admitees. And so we want to get

20:04.036 --> 20:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
upper-middle-class students of
color who will be more likely to

20:08.007 --> 20:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be leaders. And Alito went very
hard at that, saying the top 10

20:12.244 --> 20:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent students are ones who --
a lot of them went to segregated

20:15.448 --> 20:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high schools. They overcame
odds. They ought to be our

20:18.317 --> 20:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaders. GWEN IFILL: Richard
Kahlenberg just said that this

20:20.986 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- everybody basically agrees
that diversity is a good thing.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yet I noticed something that
Justice Roberts, the chief

20:25.791 --> 20:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justice, said today. He said,
what unique perspective does a

20:29.161 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
minority student bring to a
physics class? Do you see that

20:32.131 --> 20:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's general agreement that
diversity, in and of itself, is

20:34.667 --> 20:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a good thing? JANAI NELSON:
Well, I have to say that what

20:39.638 --> 20:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was very heartening about the
arguments today and the

20:42.475 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justices' receptivity of them
was that not only is diversity

20:47.947 --> 20:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that universities
should seek to achieve, but also

20:49.949 --> 20:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there was a recognition that the
court has held now four times

20:51.951 --> 20:53.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that you can use race in
admissions, that you can use it

20:53.953 --> 20:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so long as it's constitutionally
permissible, so long as you do

20:56.222 --> 20:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it in a narrow way, and it
fulfills a compelling

20:59.191 --> 21:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governmental interest. The
comment that Chief Justice

21:01.894 --> 21:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Roberts made really reflects
perhaps some individual or

21:06.932 --> 21:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personal lack of understanding
about the contributions that

21:10.202 --> 21:12.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diversity makes to the
university setting. But I think

21:12.872 --> 21:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we can all agree that the
Supreme Court has already spoken

21:15.207 --> 21:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on this in a 5-4 decision, so we
know that there are justices who

21:18.811 --> 21:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may not agree with this. But we
know that it is the law of the

21:21.714 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
land that you can use race in
admissions and that diversity is

21:24.984 --> 21:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a compelling governmental
interest. GWEN IFILL: Let me

21:28.487 --> 21:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
read to you both -- and we will
put it up on the screen too --

21:32.658 --> 21:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one another thing that one of
the justices said. And that's

21:35.294 --> 21:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice Antonin Scalia, who said
from the bench: "There are those

21:37.930 --> 21:40.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who contend that it does not
benefit African-Americans to get

21:40.332 --> 21:42.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them into the University of
Texas, where they do not do

21:43.002 --> 21:45.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, as opposed to having them
go to a less-advanced school, a

21:45.871 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slower-track school, where they
do well." And then he went on to

21:48.207 --> 21:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say -- well, let -- didn't go on
to say -- we're going to move --

21:51.677 --> 21:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OK. "One of the briefs pointed
out that most of the black

21:54.547 --> 21:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scientists in this country don't
come from schools like the

21:57.049 --> 21:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of Texas. They come
from lesser schools where they

21:59.151 --> 22:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do not feel that they're being
pushed ahead in classes that are

22:01.887 --> 22:04.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
too fast for them." Mr.
Kahlenberg, what did Justice

22:04.957 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scalia mean by that? RICHARD
KAHLENBERG: Well, I personally

22:08.227 --> 22:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think he helped his cause
in suggesting that the classes

22:13.899 --> 22:16.435 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
are too hard for
African-Americans, playing into

22:16.468 --> 22:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those stereotypes. I think the
bigger issue, though, is what

22:20.639 --> 22:23.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of diversity are we going
to have on campus? Right now, we

22:23.943 --> 22:27.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do a good job of bringing in
upper-middle-class students of

22:27.646 --> 22:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all colors, right? We have got
86 percent of African-American

22:33.052 --> 22:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students today at the selective
colleges are middle or upper

22:36.922 --> 22:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
class. And the white students
are even wealthier. So we're

22:40.526 --> 22:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bringing in racial diversity,
but we're not going further to

22:44.663 --> 22:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
socioeconomic diversity. And it
seems to me that's where --

22:48.867 --> 22:51.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice Scalia aside, Justice
Kennedy is the key here in this

22:51.737 --> 22:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case. GWEN IFILL: Yes. RICHARD
KAHLENBERG: He's the deciding

22:56.041 --> 22:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote. And he has been pushing
universities to say, we want you

22:58.043 --> 23:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get diversity, but try it in
other ways. And I think he's

23:01.247 --> 23:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
likely to pave the way in the
ultimate decision for a more

23:05.718 --> 23:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
robust affirmative action that
addresses our big economic

23:09.154 --> 23:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
divide, as well as our racial
issues. GWEN IFILL: Justice

23:12.891 --> 23:16.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kennedy always seems to be the
hinge point in all of these

23:16.762 --> 23:22.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debates. But I guess one of the
reasons I was curious about what

23:22.067 --> 23:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice Scalia said, Janai
Nelson, is because there's been

23:27.206 --> 23:31.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a -- one thing that has changed
since last time is there's this

23:31.610 --> 23:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
matchup of all these college
protests, in which people feel

23:33.612 --> 23:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that maybe they don't fit in and
they don't fit in their campus,

23:35.614 --> 23:37.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they haven't had enough
attention paid. Did you have any

23:37.616 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sense that that was affecting
any of the reasoning of the

23:39.618 --> 23:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justices today in listening to
this case again? JANAI NELSON: I

23:41.620 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't say that it necessarily
affected the justices, but I can

23:43.622 --> 23:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say that Justice Scalia's very
unfortunate and misguided

23:45.624 --> 23:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comment in that (INAUDIBLE)
against African-Americans and

23:49.695 --> 23:53.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every other minority in terms of
whether they can compete with

23:53.265 --> 23:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others in a highly competitive
higher education setting, what

23:58.270 --> 24:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it reveals is that he doesn't
have faith in the concept of

24:03.475 --> 24:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diversity and what it does for
all students. Also, I think what

24:07.513 --> 24:10.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was packed in there was a pot
shot, frankly, against our

24:10.816 --> 24:13.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
historically black colleges and
universities that have served

24:13.886 --> 24:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-Americans at a time when
this country wouldn't and

24:17.056 --> 24:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue to provide a space for
African-Americans to thrive. I

24:20.893 --> 24:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think he realized that he
also really affirmed the notion

24:24.897 --> 24:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that black students, like all
students, need a university

24:29.234 --> 24:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
environment in which there are
high expectations are for them,

24:32.071 --> 24:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in which they are welcomed, in
which they are provided

24:34.707 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opportunities. And the
University of Texas is seeking

24:37.710 --> 24:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do that through this very
thoughtful admissions process.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to ask you
both, based on what you heard

24:42.781 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today and what you have heard in
the past, what do you think the

24:46.819 --> 24:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court is wrestling with at this
stage? I know Justice Kennedy

24:49.421 --> 24:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said at one point he needed more
information. RICHARD KAHLENBERG:

24:51.423 --> 24:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. Well, he said that early on
in the arguments. And then, when

24:53.425 --> 24:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was pressing Texas to say,
well, what new information could

24:56.362 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you provide, I think he pulled
back from that a little bit. I

24:59.198 --> 25:02.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think what -- we're likely to
have a decision some time this

25:02.935 --> 25:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year. I think we're going to see
a brand-new affirmative action

25:06.271 --> 25:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come out of this. So, instead of
basing our decisions on which,

25:11.343 --> 25:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, racial box a student
checks, it will be based on

25:14.947 --> 25:18.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alternatives that Justice
Kennedy likes, things like

25:18.550 --> 25:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
socioeconomic affirmative
action, to give a leg up to

25:22.354 --> 25:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students who are -- you know,
the -- it would give a leg up to

25:25.457 --> 25:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the young Michelle Obama, the
young Sonia Sotomayor, who grew

25:29.094 --> 25:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up in public housing, but not to
Michelle -- to Sasha and Malia.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(CROSSTALK) GWEN IFILL: I would
like you to have a chance to

25:35.067 --> 25:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respond. Go ahead. JANAI NELSON:
Yes. We think that an equal

25:37.403 --> 25:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity for everyone,
regardless of their

25:39.405 --> 25:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
socioeconomic background, should
be afforded to them. Clearly, we

25:41.407 --> 25:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care about economic diversity.
And that is certainly one of the

25:44.476 --> 25:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many factors that the University
of Texas considers when

25:46.478 --> 25:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
determining how it will compose
its diversity in its entering

25:48.480 --> 25:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freshman class. And there's no
reason to think that we have to

25:50.482 --> 25:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
choose race or class. We can
consider the complexity of an

25:52.484 --> 25:54.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individual in his or her
entirety, their race, their

25:54.486 --> 25:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
class, their language, their
parental background, whether

25:56.488 --> 25:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're from a single-family
household, their geography. All

25:58.490 --> 26:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those play into creating the
whole person. GWEN IFILL: All

26:05.397 --> 26:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, we will obviously, as
always, know something by June.

Richard Kahlenberg the Century
Foundation, Janai Nelson of the

26:17.643 --> 26:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAACP Legal Defense Fund, thank
you both. RICHARD KAHLENBERG:

26:23.415 --> 26:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you. JANAI NELSON: Thank
you. JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with

26:29.855 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us. Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Greek police round up migrants

26:36.028 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the border with Macedonia;
plus, the link between stress

26:40.532 --> 26:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and asthma. But, first, in this
presidential race, as with any

26:45.304 --> 26:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the previous ones over the
past few decades, potential

26:48.607 --> 26:52.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters have been inundated with
a seemingly nonstop wave of

26:52.644 --> 26:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opinion polls. But what do polls
really tell us? Historically, at

26:57.483 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this point in the race, they
aren't always a good predictor

27:00.452 --> 27:04.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the eventual party nominee.
So, how can Americans decipher

27:04.389 --> 27:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which ones are more accurate
than others? In a report that's

27:07.759 --> 27:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of our collaboration with
"The Atlantic" magazine, we

27:11.096 --> 27:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
break down the art and science
of polling. JESSE JACKSON,

27:14.733 --> 27:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Presidential Candidate: Who
would have thought that I would

27:18.737 --> 27:22.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be in front? JUDY WOODRUFF:
Remember President Jesse

27:22.307 --> 27:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jackson? President Mario Cuomo?
No? How about President Howard

27:26.378 --> 27:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dean or Presidents Gingrich,
Cain and Santorum? RICK SANTORUM

27:33.018 --> 27:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(R), Presidential Candidate:
Thank you so much Iowa. JUDY

27:35.020 --> 27:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Not ringing any bells?
Of course, none of these men

27:38.724 --> 27:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually became president. But
each was once deemed a

27:42.861 --> 27:46.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front-runner in the polls,
however briefly, as he sought

27:46.298 --> 27:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his party's nomination. Early
polls sometimes do reflect the

27:51.103 --> 27:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
final numbers. Think Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and Al Gore in

27:55.941 --> 28:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2000. Both led early and became
party nominees. And who knows,

28:01.580 --> 28:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe 2016 will be one of those
years, as the Trump juggernaut

28:06.184 --> 28:10.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shows little sign of slowing.
But, often, the early leader

28:10.522 --> 28:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't hold onto that lead.

Co-Founder, Public Opinion
Strategies: I don't think Peter

28:14.526 --> 28:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I, or any pollster, would
tell you that a poll today has

28:17.329 --> 28:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much or any predictive power for
what October of 2016 will look

28:21.667 --> 28:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like. JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
pollster Bill McInturff partners

Hart to conduct the NBC/Wall

28:29.741 --> 28:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street Journal poll. PETER HART,
Democratic Pollster: Judy, four

28:32.177 --> 28:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years from now, you're going to
come right at the two of us and

28:35.013 --> 28:39.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're going to say, you had Ben
Carson and Donald Trump winning

28:39.751 --> 28:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this election. No, we didn't. We
told you that this is where the

28:44.056 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American public is in the odd
year before we're there. JUDY

28:47.759 --> 28:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The most reputable
pollsters stand by the accuracy

28:51.063 --> 28:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of their work, but acknowledge
they're wrestling with a sea

28:54.866 --> 28:57.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change in polling methods. BILL
MCINTURFF: There's no question

28:57.703 --> 29:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's harder and much more
difficult to collect an accurate

29:00.472 --> 29:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opinion, a sample of opinion of
Americans. I don't think

29:03.976 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
industry has figured out all of
our methodological problems, and

29:06.845 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we know is, like everything
else, to fix something, it takes

29:09.881 --> 29:13.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of money. JUDY WOODRUFF:
One problem is cell phones. MAN:

29:13.285 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have a landline at home for
the Internet, and I don't answer

29:18.790 --> 29:22.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it ever. MAN: My landline isn't
plugged in. I just use a cell

29:22.060 --> 29:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
phone. JUDY WOODRUFF: Pollsters
actually do reach out to those

29:24.796 --> 29:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people on cell phones, lots of
them, but it's expensive, far

29:29.301 --> 29:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more expensive than calling a
landline. That's because

29:33.038 --> 29:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pollsters calling landlines can
use auto-dialers, computer

29:37.309 --> 29:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programs that dial random
numbers. But the FCC prohibits

29:42.047 --> 29:46.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
auto-dialers for cell phones, so
every call to a mobile device

29:46.451 --> 29:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
must be made by a person. LEE
MIRINGOFF, Director, Marist

Institute for Public Opinion:
This is a state-of-the-art

29:50.889 --> 29:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facility, but all the interviews
are being done manually in terms

29:55.327 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of punching in the numbers of
the people we want to reach.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no auto-dialing going
on. And we don't even have the

30:00.666 --> 30:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capacity to do that. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Lee Miringoff directs

30:02.668 --> 30:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion. LEE MIRINGOFF: Good

30:07.072 --> 30:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scientific, rigorous polls have
become more difficult. They have

30:11.209 --> 30:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become more expensive. And,
unfortunately, we also have seen

30:16.281 --> 30:20.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a proliferation of lower-quality
polls that also get picked up in

30:20.919 --> 30:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the media. So, for the public as
a whole, it gets a little

30:24.056 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confused trying to sort out all
the numbers. BILL MCINTURFF: In

30:27.059 --> 30:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bad polls that I have seen, and
mostly in a partisan setting,

30:31.697 --> 30:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they interview anybody who
answers the phone. Well, guess

30:33.699 --> 30:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who answers the phone now? It's
all people over 50. JUDY

30:36.034 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So polls that avoid
the expense of calling cell

30:39.504 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
phones exclude a significant
segment of the population. BILL

30:43.442 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MCINTURFF: Forty-five percent of
the people in the country have a

30:45.644 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cell phone only, and those
people who are most likely to

30:48.714 --> 30:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a cell phone, they are
Latinos, some of our America's

30:52.417 --> 30:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
poorer respondents, who that's
the one phone they have, and

30:55.320 --> 30:58.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
younger people. So guess what?
If you under-represent in our

30:58.824 --> 31:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politics, Latinos, the poor,
younger people, you are

31:02.928 --> 31:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
systematically undercounting
Democrats. JUDY WOODRUFF: What

31:05.297 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about online-only polls? PETER
HART: Trouble. I mean, I think

31:09.534 --> 31:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the work that SurveyMonkey
is doing is exceptionally good.

31:13.271 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think there are an awful
lot of people who are in this,

31:16.608 --> 31:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, essentially, unless you
really understand the business

31:21.813 --> 31:26.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of polling, online polling can
be exceptionally dangerous. BILL

31:26.151 --> 31:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MCINTURFF: But if you're a local
news organization, and someone

31:28.153 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says, hey, I can give you a
headline for literally $5,000 or

31:31.656 --> 31:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$7,000 for a poll, compared to
our telling you, wow, that's

31:35.994 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just going to be the
interviewing cost for just a

31:37.996 --> 31:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little fraction, that's -- I
mean, we have had an explosion

31:41.066 --> 31:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that kind of polling. JUDY
WOODRUFF: The major polling

31:43.502 --> 31:47.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organizations like
ABC/Washington Post, NBC/Wall

31:47.539 --> 31:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street Journal, Marist, Pew, and
others continue to produce

31:52.077 --> 31:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excellent, accurate polls. But
because of their expense, many

31:56.481 --> 32:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the industry are working hard
to improve the accuracy of less

32:00.852 --> 32:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
costly nontraditional methods
like online polling. Meanwhile,

32:06.057 --> 32:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the presidential campaign
heats up, and polls proliferate,

32:10.428 --> 32:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lesson for voters is buyer
beware and to understand that

32:14.766 --> 32:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not all polls are created equal.
At this stage in an election

32:19.271 --> 32:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
season, the main targets in the
efforts to reach voters are the

32:22.874 --> 32:27.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
early primary and caucus states,
like Iowa. Here, every four

32:27.646 --> 32:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, voters are flooded with
phone calls, not just at home,

32:32.184 --> 32:34.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but wherever they carry a cell
phone. WOMAN: I would we say we

32:34.619 --> 32:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably get them twice a day,
everyday. WOMAN: Two or three a

32:37.856 --> 32:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
day. And do I answer them? No.
TINA SHAW, Voter: Our landline

32:42.894 --> 32:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rings nonstop. JUDY WOODRUFF: I
sat down with these Iowa voters

32:46.464 --> 32:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Drake University in Des
Moines to hear firsthand what

32:50.135 --> 32:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's like to be the target of so
many polling calls. TINA SHAW:

32:53.872 --> 32:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's become somewhat of a game
to figure out who's conducting

32:56.808 --> 33:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the poll. OLIVIA O'HEA, Voter:
Typically, I kind of screen them

33:00.078 --> 33:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and don't answer if I don't
recognize the number. But when I

33:02.848 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pick up, I do like to
participate. RAYMOND STARKS,

33:05.483 --> 33:07.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Voter: I like to kind of
decipher, you know, what is

33:07.719 --> 33:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their agenda, why are they
trying to push this issue,

33:09.721 --> 33:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because that's what you're going
to be seeing in the next two

33:11.723 --> 33:13.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weeks to a month. J. ANN SELZER,
Selzer &amp; Company, Inc.: The

33:13.725 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assignment that Iowans are given
is to look at more candidates

33:16.328 --> 33:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than any other state does, and,
really, embedded in that

33:20.298 --> 33:23.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assignment is to keep an open
mind. JUDY WOODRUFF: Ann Selzer

33:23.301 --> 33:26.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
runs the Des Moines
Register/Bloomberg poll. She

33:26.504 --> 33:30.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says polling for caucuses
presents special challenges. J.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN SELZER: Finding the people
who are actually going to show

33:32.477 --> 33:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up on caucus night, and getting
a good cross-section of them, is

33:35.947 --> 33:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult from the get-go. It
always has been difficult. What

33:39.851 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has added to it is that, with
the proliferation of polls,

33:43.154 --> 33:46.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's a greater likelihood of
polling burnout. JUDY WOODRUFF:

33:46.324 --> 33:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it about polling -- is
there something about polling

33:49.127 --> 33:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that annoys you? DENNIS OLSON,
Voter: I don't like the negative

33:51.529 --> 33:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ones, where they will say, did
you know this person backs -- is

33:54.399 --> 33:57.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not -- is in favor of abortion?
And then they go into these

33:57.235 --> 34:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things. You can tell right away,
right when it starts. I hang up

34:00.105 --> 34:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on those types of ones. TINA
SHAW: I think when they start

34:02.741 --> 34:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manipulating the questions, it
turns me off. So, it's very

34:05.477 --> 34:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skewed or trying to lead me down
a garden path, I feel like

34:09.047 --> 34:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's when I click off. J. ANN
SELZER: It is become far more

34:12.417 --> 34:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
complicated for the public. And
I feel for the public, because

34:15.587 --> 34:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are so many polls, and
even I have a hard time weeding

34:19.591 --> 34:22.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through and finding what
methodology was used. JUDY

34:22.327 --> 34:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Determining the source
and purpose of a poll can be

34:25.363 --> 34:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daunting for voters. Public
polls like those conducted by

34:29.200 --> 34:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
large media organizations mainly
measure which candidate is up

34:33.605 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and which is down, and what
voters think of them. But the

34:37.108 --> 34:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaigns themselves are also
polling, often in an effort to

34:41.413 --> 34:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change voters' opinions. JEFF
LINK, Link Strategies: We're

34:43.682 --> 34:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really doing a lot of message
development and message testing.

34:47.018 --> 34:50.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeff Link
directed polling in 25 states

34:50.722 --> 34:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the 2008 Obama campaign.
JEFF LINK: The horse race

34:54.192 --> 34:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information is not really the
most important thing for a

34:57.996 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign. It shouldn't be. What
we're really doing with our

35:02.500 --> 35:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
polling internally is trying to
figure out, what are the issues

35:06.104 --> 35:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we need to emphasize the
most, what are the aspects of a

35:09.441 --> 35:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidate's background that are
most appealing to voters? JUDY

35:12.978 --> 35:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And what to say about
an opponent? JEFF LINK: And,

35:15.380 --> 35:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certainly yes, what to say about
an opponent, what people find

35:18.683 --> 35:22.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most disturbing about an
opponent's record, or what's

35:22.087 --> 35:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something they have said. MATT
STRAWN, Former Chairman, Iowa

35:24.289 --> 35:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Party: Polling ranks
near the top of any decision

35:26.291 --> 35:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to resource
allocation within a campaign.

35:28.293 --> 35:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt Strawn is a
former chairman of the Iowa

35:31.196 --> 35:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Party. MATT STRAWN:
Where are your weaknesses and

35:33.498 --> 35:36.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deficiencies? Do you have
weaknesses with female voters in

35:36.868 --> 35:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the eastern part of the state?
You need polling to guide those

35:39.671 --> 35:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decisions. J. ANN SELZER: People
are often asking me, are these

35:42.173 --> 35:45.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers going to hold through
caucus night, and I always

35:45.276 --> 35:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reply, I hope not, and it's hard
to imagine they would. The

35:48.880 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaigns are spending a lot of
time, and money, and effort, and

35:52.617 --> 35:55.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bringing their candidate into
our state to change those

35:55.320 --> 35:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers. So one would hope that
they would. And if they were to

35:59.891 --> 36:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hold, why would we continue to
poll? PETER HART: I think what

36:02.360 --> 36:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you really want to understand is
the mood and the direction of

36:05.063 --> 36:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the electorate. And the fact
that we have Donald Trump ahead,

36:10.101 --> 36:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't get caught up with that.
Understand the anger behind that

36:14.005 --> 36:17.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what that is expressing. J.
ANN SELZER: Imagine how you

36:17.142 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be thinking about this
race -- and let's take the

36:19.144 --> 36:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican side -- if you didn't
know what the polls were saying.

36:23.648 --> 36:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have a field of 15, 16
candidates. How would you know

36:28.553 --> 36:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is doing well and who is not
doing well if you didn't have a

36:32.190 --> 36:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
poll to tell you? Would you
predict Donald Trump? Would you

36:35.126 --> 36:38.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
predict Ben Carson? So I think
those polls are really very

36:38.530 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helpful at shaping the debate,
and helping people decide how

36:42.133 --> 36:44.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they want to vote. JUDY
WOODRUFF: As Iowa voters head

36:44.569 --> 36:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into another caucus season, they
will endure the onset of winter,

36:48.640 --> 36:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as the continued barrage
of polling calls, wanted or not.

36:54.546 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Being Iowans, they will take it
all in stride, and on a wintry

36:58.850 --> 37:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
February night, they will caucus
for their candidate of choice,

37:03.321 --> 37:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bearing out or not what the
polls were showing. GWEN IFILL:

37:16.367 --> 37:20.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greek riot police have closed
down a temporary transit camp

37:20.071 --> 37:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
used by refugees and migrants on
the border with Macedonia. The

37:23.808 --> 37:26.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
action comes as Balkan
countries, including Macedonia,

37:27.011 --> 37:30.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have closed their frontiers to
all nationalities except those

37:30.982 --> 37:34.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from Syria, Iraq and
Afghanistan. That leaves

37:34.319 --> 37:37.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thousands of so-called economic
migrants hoping to reach

37:37.589 --> 37:41.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
northern Europe stranded in
Greece. From the border, special

37:41.359 --> 37:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent Malcolm Brabant
reports. MALCOLM BRABANT: The

37:46.064 --> 37:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police sealed off the village of
Idomeni at dawn and expelled

37:49.701 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
news teams from the makeshift
camp, so the operation wouldn't

37:53.104 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be conducted under the glare of
publicity. Extra riot police in

37:57.809 --> 38:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
full battle gear were brought
in. And there are claims on

38:00.778 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
social media that excessive
force was used to remove people

38:04.182 --> 38:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from their tents. Hundreds of
migrants were placed on buses

38:08.219 --> 38:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sent back to Athens and the
northern city of Thessaloniki.

Volunteer: Driving them back to
Athens without a real options,

38:19.797 --> 38:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, we don't really know what
they will be forced to do now.

38:22.400 --> 38:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will they be deported from
Athens? Or -- like, these people

38:26.171 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need a viable option right now.
And just moving them from one

38:29.941 --> 38:32.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place to another will not to
clear up their situation right

38:33.011 --> 38:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now. MALCOLM BRABANT: The Greek
operation represents a

38:36.080 --> 38:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
substantial change in policy,
because, for months, they had

38:39.417 --> 38:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helped refugees on their way
north. But the Greeks' hand was

38:42.854 --> 38:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forced by the Balkan countries,
which had decided that they

38:45.957 --> 38:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would only accept refugees from
the conflicts in Iraq, Syria and

38:50.562 --> 38:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghanistan. These were the
poignant poster boys of the last

38:54.332 --> 38:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demonstration about the double
anguish of thwarted journeys and

39:03.608 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reluctance to retrace steps.
Osman Zihra was an airport

39:08.112 --> 39:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worker in Morocco. Weary of what
he called bad democracy and

39:13.785 --> 39:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insecure employment prospects,
he joined the migrant trail. But

39:18.423 --> 39:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the thousands he spent to get
here so far count for nothing.

39:24.629 --> 39:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OSMAN ZIHRA, Refugee: Europe
needs much more people to work

39:29.801 --> 39:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for them, because European
people aren't going to work like

39:33.805 --> 39:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us. We can work Saturday. We can
work Sunday. We can go after

39:38.076 --> 39:43.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours of work. We can work more
hours. But they -- and we can be

39:43.548 --> 39:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cheap for -- you understand me?
MALCOLM BRABANT: Two decades

39:46.818 --> 39:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into Europe's open-border
project, razor wire now

39:49.821 --> 39:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
separates some countries in
Central Europe and the Balkans.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Macedonian government claims
it erected the fence to improve

39:56.828 --> 40:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
control of the migrant flow.
This gate was the only entry

40:00.398 --> 40:03.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point for Syrians, Iraqis and
Afghans. The Macedonians

40:04.002 --> 40:09.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rejected anyone with suspicious
papers. They protested that they

40:16.481 --> 40:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were one people, but the migrant
trail now has a class system

40:20.218 --> 40:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is frustrating Tassdaq
Hussain from Pakistan. TASSDAQ

40:23.621 --> 40:25.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HUSSAIN, Refugee: If we have no
problem there, then why I come

40:25.623 --> 40:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here? We have much problems
there in Pakistan. And,

40:29.160 --> 40:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
therefore, we come here. And no
woman wants to leave her family,

40:34.699 --> 40:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her homeland if there is a
suitable job and other things

40:39.304 --> 40:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
available in his country.
MALCOLM BRABANT: George

40:41.406 --> 40:44.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kosmopoulos from Amnesty
International could offer

40:44.075 --> 40:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nothing but sympathy. GEORGE
KOSMOPOULOS, Amnesty

40:46.077 --> 40:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
International: But I don't they
will let you pass for the

40:48.780 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment. I don't know what the
police will do. I'm really sorry

40:51.883 --> 40:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't help you. Everyone
substantially has the right to

40:55.086 --> 40:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claim asylum, has the right to
explain their individual

40:57.655 --> 40:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
circumstances, and then there
should be a decision whether

41:00.024 --> 41:03.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these people are refugees or
not. What we actually see here

41:03.294 --> 41:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is just people being divided
according to nationality and

41:06.331 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nothing else. And that's
discrimination. It's not fair,

41:09.667 --> 41:13.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put it simply, because anyone
can be a refugee. Anyone might

41:13.838 --> 41:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have protection needs. And this
is simply not taken into account

41:16.841 --> 41:19.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here. MALCOLM BRABANT: Before
the closure, Alexandros

41:19.544 --> 41:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Voulgaris, from the U.N. Refugee
Agency, failed to persuade these

41:23.348 --> 41:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young Somalis to consider
returning to Athens or perhaps

41:26.718 --> 41:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beyond. ALEXANDROS VOULGARIS,
U.N. Refugee Agency: Why are you

41:30.922 --> 41:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still here, when you see and you
know that this is a policy

41:32.924 --> 41:35.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decision, and the countries have
taken this decision for you?

41:35.526 --> 41:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABDALLAMOHAMED HALENE, Refugee:
Maybe they will change their

41:38.629 --> 41:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opinion. Always, they believe it
will be changed. ALEXANDROS

41:42.066 --> 41:44.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VOULGARIS: The door is closed
and they need to start

41:44.802 --> 41:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considering their other options.
MALCOLM BRABANT: And what are

41:47.438 --> 41:49.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those options? ALEXANDROS
VOULGARIS: For those that have

41:49.907 --> 41:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugee profiles, the asylum
procedures. And for those that

41:53.644 --> 41:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do not have, there is always
IOM, the International

41:57.782 --> 42:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Organization for Migration,
where they can apply to return

42:00.818 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to their countries. MALCOLM
BRABANT: What happened? MAN:

42:05.123 --> 42:07.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Morocco. MALCOLM BRABANT:
Earlier this week, the

42:07.258 --> 42:11.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Macedonians supported scores of
economic migrants. Some appeared

42:11.095 --> 42:14.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be injured after crossing
mountains from Greece. Human

42:14.432 --> 42:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rights groups have repeatedly
accused the Macedonians of

42:17.435 --> 42:20.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
firing rubber bullets at asylum
seekers. MAN: Thank you, Greece.

42:20.705 --> 42:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police, Greece, thank you. Thank
you. Thank you. MAN: No

42:27.979 --> 42:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pictures. MALCOLM BRABANT: So
where do the rejected migrants

42:36.187 --> 42:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go now? Giannis Papageorgiou, a
political scientist who

42:40.691 --> 42:43.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specializes in immigration
policy, believes they will try

42:43.995 --> 42:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alternative groups to get out of
Greece. GIANNIS PAPAGEORGIOU,

42:46.931 --> 42:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Political Scientist: As far as
the risk of refugees or migrants

42:50.635 --> 42:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
staying in Greece, yes, it is a
genuine risk. To some extent, I

42:57.308 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think that the economic
situation of the country would

43:01.446 --> 43:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deter them from staying long,
because they have nothing to do.

43:05.817 --> 43:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have -- it is difficult to
survive in Greece, even -- and

43:10.421 --> 43:14.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they would have to live in some
form of camps, which I don't

43:14.459 --> 43:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think they would. REFUGEES: We
want freedom! We want freedom!

43:16.961 --> 43:20.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want freedom! We want
freedom! MALCOLM BRABANT: But

43:20.731 --> 43:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Europe is becoming increasingly
deaf to this appeal. Even the

43:23.868 --> 43:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more hospitable nations like
Germany and Sweden are promising

43:28.873 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deport those who don't merit
political asylum. Idomeni

43:35.513 --> 43:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
represents a new European
reality. It's a field of broken

43:39.517 --> 43:43.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dreams. For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Malcolm Brabant on the

43:43.054 --> 43:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greek-Macedonian border. JUDY
WOODRUFF: For more than a

43:55.299 --> 43:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decade, the number of Americans
diagnosed with asthma has grown

43:59.136 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dramatically, with a nearly 50
percent increase among

44:02.807 --> 44:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American children.
Scientists are puzzling over why

44:06.410 --> 44:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some communities are especially
hard-hit and are investigating

44:10.314 --> 44:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
links to obesity, bacteria and
chemicals. But new evidence also

44:15.119 --> 44:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points to a mind/body connection
and the role of stress and

44:19.090 --> 44:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trauma. Special correspondent
Indira Lakshmanan has our report

44:23.494 --> 44:27.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Michigan. This story was
produced in collaboration with

44:27.198 --> 44:31.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Detroit News. WOMAN:
Cameron, get up. It's time to

44:31.669 --> 44:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get up. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN:
Cameron Carter wakes up every

44:34.705 --> 44:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
morning with the after-effects
of her cousin's murder. When her

44:38.142 --> 44:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cousin was 12, he was shot to
death by a neighbor at a

44:41.245 --> 44:44.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
birthday party. Soon after,
Cameron ended up in the E.R.

44:44.982 --> 44:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
herself, struggling to breathe
from a severe asthma attack.

CAMERON CARTER, Asthma Patient:
When I worry, I start to, like,

44:50.788 --> 44:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get scared and stuff, and when I
get scared, my asthma, it starts

44:55.459 --> 44:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to mess up. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN:
Duncan Smith spent the first

44:59.330 --> 45:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eight months of his life lying
on his back in an Russian

45:03.968 --> 45:07.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
orphanage, often alone, before
being adopted by a middle-class

45:07.438 --> 45:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family in suburban Detroit. His
parents say he sometimes

45:10.908 --> 45:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggled to breathe as a baby.
Today, he has asthma too. DUNCAN

45:15.546 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMITH, Asthma Patient: Every
time I breathe, I just feel a

45:18.883 --> 45:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little bit of pain, because it's
coming from my lungs and going

45:23.621 --> 45:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: Malik
Cole's family has been in and

45:27.124 --> 45:30.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of temporary housing for a
year, because his father's

45:30.328 --> 45:34.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
income doesn't cover a rent. He
and his four siblings were

45:34.165 --> 45:38.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sleeping in their car with their
parents when we first met. On

45:38.269 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stressful days, his asthma gets
so bad that he vomits or passes

45:42.607 --> 45:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out. MALIK COLE, Asthma Patient:
It feels like I'm hurting. Like

45:46.877 --> 45:49.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm dying. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN:
These children are part of a

45:49.981 --> 45:54.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing phenomenon. Nearly one
in 10 children in the U.S. have

45:54.251 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asthma today. Doctors have long
understood asthma as an

45:58.322 --> 46:01.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inflammation of the airways,
triggered by allergens like pets

46:01.726 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and pollen, and environmental
irritants like pollution, smoke

46:05.529 --> 46:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and mold. It's also often
hereditary. But across the

46:09.500 --> 46:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, in places like Detroit,
where childhood asthma has

46:12.603 --> 46:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reached epidemic proportions,
new research shows that stress,

46:16.674 --> 46:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abuse and neighborhood violence
may play as big a role as

46:20.077 --> 46:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
physical conditions in causing
kids who never had asthma to

46:23.714 --> 46:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
develop the life-threatening
disease. WOMAN: So, we like you,

46:26.817 --> 46:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but we don't want to see you
here. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: While

46:28.819 --> 46:32.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some stress is helpful in facing
challenging situations, too much

46:32.390 --> 46:35.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for too long can trigger the
adrenal glands above the kidneys

46:35.493 --> 46:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to overproduce cortisol and
adrenaline. Those chemicals, in

46:39.430 --> 46:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turn, can kick the immune system
into overdrive and can fuel an

46:42.667 --> 46:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
array of health problems,
including, according to new

46:45.536 --> 46:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
studies, asthma. KAREN BOUFFARD,
The Detroit News: One in three

46:48.539 --> 46:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Detroit children are living in
extreme poverty. INDIRA

46:51.942 --> 46:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAKSHMANAN: Karen Bouffard of
The Detroit News says the Motor

46:55.546 --> 46:58.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
City's alarmingly high childhood
asthma rates map closely with

46:58.416 --> 47:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the nation's most
violent and impoverished

47:00.785 --> 47:05.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighborhoods. KAREN BOUFFARD:
And about a quarter of children

47:05.256 --> 47:07.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under 6 in Detroit live in
households where there is no

47:07.258 --> 47:09.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adult working at all. INDIRA
LAKSHMANAN: That must make more

47:09.260 --> 47:11.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for an incredibly stressful home
life. KAREN BOUFFARD: It does.

47:11.262 --> 47:14.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a whole range of
effects. Parents are worried

47:14.065 --> 47:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming up with the rent or the
electric bill, the gas money,

47:17.868 --> 47:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that kind of stress comes
through for children. INDIRA

47:21.305 --> 47:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAKSHMANAN: The Henry Ford
Health System has opened two

47:23.607 --> 47:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mobile clinics to address
soaring childhood asthma rates,

47:26.610 --> 47:29.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and has seven school-based
health centers in some of the

47:29.680 --> 47:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city's poorest neighborhoods.
WOMAN: Raise your right hand if

47:32.983 --> 47:37.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have ever been told that you
have asthma. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN:

47:37.455 --> 47:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Asthma is the leading chronic
condition causing kids to miss

47:40.291 --> 47:45.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school in Detroit. Most don't
even have access to inhalers. So

47:45.196 --> 47:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
medications are now being
delivered directly to children

47:47.965 --> 47:51.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at school, with pictures to
remind kids how to use their

47:51.102 --> 47:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inhalers even if there's no
adult to help. WOMAN: What are

47:53.771 --> 47:57.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you going to do if you want to
be breathing well? STUDENT: Two

47:57.575 --> 48:00.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
puffs every morning. WOMAN: Two
puffs every morning. (CROSSTALK)

48:00.044 --> 48:02.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: And two puffs every
night. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: But as

48:02.213 --> 48:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cameron Carter and her mother,
Vickey, know, asthma medication

48:04.215 --> 48:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't fix everything. The murder
of Cameron's cousin is just one

48:07.885 --> 48:10.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the tragedies that has
punctuated her young life.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VICKEY CARTER-IVORY, Mother of
Cameron Carter: We had a house

48:12.556 --> 48:16.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fire during a birthday party. We
have had family members pass

48:16.060 --> 48:19.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away. My best friend committed
suicide. A really good friend of

48:19.430 --> 48:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my husband's was murdered. We
had another house fire. We have

48:23.067 --> 48:27.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had financial difficulties.
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: Vickey

48:27.071 --> 48:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
noticed her daughter's asthma
often spiked in periods of high

48:31.175 --> 48:35.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stress. And Cameron's attacks
got so bad that her mother

48:35.179 --> 48:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
started homeschooling her. The
two joined a National Institutes

48:38.749 --> 48:41.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Health-funded study on the
connection among bad

48:41.952 --> 48:45.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experiences, the stress hormone
cortisol, and asthma. VICKEY

48:45.356 --> 48:47.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARTER-IVORY: After the study,
it kind of was a light bulb

48:47.458 --> 48:53.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment, where it really made
sense that stress caused asthma

48:53.230 --> 48:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues. Not all stress -- I
mean, not all asthma issues are

48:57.101 --> 49:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stress-related, but it is a big
issue. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: A

49:01.705 --> 49:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recent report in a leading
journal on asthma, allergy and

49:05.709 --> 49:08.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immunology found children
exposed to just one traumatic

49:08.913 --> 49:12.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience at home, like
divorce, death of a parent, or

49:12.917 --> 49:16.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abuse, were 28 percent more
likely to report having asthma

49:16.921 --> 49:20.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
during childhood. Those who
suffered four traumatic events

49:20.291 --> 49:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were 73 percent more likely to
have asthma. DR. ROSALIND

49:24.628 --> 49:26.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WRIGHT, Kravis Children's
Hospital: You can't ignore it

49:26.630 --> 49:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anymore. The data is there that
says psychological stress is a

49:29.433 --> 49:32.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
factor, just like these other
physical factors. INDIRA

49:32.736 --> 49:37.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAKSHMANAN: Dr. Rosalind Wright
is a professor of pediatrics at

49:37.141 --> 49:39.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kravis Children's Hospital at
Mount Sinai Health System in New

49:39.143 --> 49:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York. Her latest work shows
stress in itself, irrespective

49:42.446 --> 49:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of poverty or environmental
toxins, can cause asthma.

49:46.050 --> 49:48.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Emerging research at other
leading institutions is

49:48.319 --> 49:52.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demonstrating the same cause and
effect. DR. ROSALIND WRIGHT: And

49:52.289 --> 49:55.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's important why? Because if
I'm talking to a patient, and

49:55.593 --> 49:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm trying to make their asthma
better, or I'm trying to think

49:57.828 --> 50:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how to prevent asthma from
happening, I want to say, these

50:00.097 --> 50:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the things we know that can
potentially lead to this, so

50:03.500 --> 50:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these are things we want to try
to help you minimize. WOMAN: So,

50:08.205 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you see the lips or
fingernails turning blue or

50:10.207 --> 50:12.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gray, that is a 911 situation.
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: But the

50:12.543 --> 50:15.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stresses on Malik just keep
adding up. Even though his

50:15.846 --> 50:19.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mother has sought asthma
education, his condition keeps

50:19.049 --> 50:23.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting worse. Sleeping in the
car as the weather turned cold

50:23.153 --> 50:26.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was making it harder for Malik
to breathe. WOMAN: Because most

50:26.156 --> 50:29.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asthmatics have difficulty at
night. There's a whole lot of

50:29.560 --> 50:32.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons why that happens. Are
you having difficulty now? Mom,

50:32.796 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have his inhaler? SIRETHA
LATTIMORE, Mother of Malik Cole:

50:35.499 --> 50:39.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. WOMAN: When I see kids like
this, I know something, because

50:39.436 --> 50:42.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's not normal. And it kind of
hurts to breathe like this.

50:42.373 --> 50:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SIRETHA LATTIMORE: Yes, I know
he's stressed out, but he don't

50:45.442 --> 50:47.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to tell me. I don't know if
he's scared, he's stressed. I

50:47.645 --> 50:49.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't know. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN:
On the day we last saw them,

50:49.847 --> 50:52.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malik's parents, with heavy
hearts, drove their four

50:52.917 --> 50:56.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
youngest children to child
protective services to request

50:56.487 --> 50:59.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the kids be placed in a
temporary foster home until the

50:59.690 --> 51:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents can find affordable
housing. Their case drives home

51:03.827 --> 51:07.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the challenge of treating asthma
when life's stresses are so

51:07.097 --> 51:11.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overwhelming. Getting medication
can be the easy part, compared

51:11.769 --> 51:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the huge challenge of
healing the underlying trauma.

51:15.439 --> 51:21.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Programs that attempt to do that
are rare. Duncan Smith's parents

51:21.045 --> 51:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turned to Easter Seals Michigan
and its new trauma intervention

51:24.214 --> 51:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
program to help Duncan and his
sister, Gabby (ph), with

51:27.718 --> 51:30.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emotional and physical
challenges stemming from their

51:30.454 --> 51:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abandonment as babies in Russia.
The children are now undergoing

51:35.025 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a series of evaluations. WOMAN:
What helps you breathe? Great

51:39.596 --> 51:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job. INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: And will
be guided to individual and

51:42.232 --> 51:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group counseling to help them
better cope with stress and

51:45.369 --> 51:48.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anxiety. A year of counseling
helped Cameron Carter and her

51:48.973 --> 51:52.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brothers, who were standing on
either side of their cousin when

51:52.376 --> 51:55.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was killed. CAMERON CARTER: I
learned that you should forgive

51:55.379 --> 51:59.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yourself before you start
blaming yourself for stuff, that

51:59.083 --> 52:02.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it wasn't your fault. INDIRA
LAKSHMANAN: Her brother,

52:02.853 --> 52:06.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alexander, who has gotten his
asthma under control, is now a

52:06.523 --> 52:09.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting running back on the
school's varsity football team.

52:09.526 --> 52:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cameron, who takes weekly dance
classes, still struggles. But,

52:15.899 --> 52:19.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as she learns to cope with her
anxieties, she's starting to

52:19.103 --> 52:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better manage her asthma, one
breath at a time. For the "PBS
