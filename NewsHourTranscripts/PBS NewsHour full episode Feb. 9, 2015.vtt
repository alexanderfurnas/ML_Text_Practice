JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Tuesday, we
talk with Mark Shields, David
Brooks, and

00:20.988 --> 00:26.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our politics duo, Amy Walter and
Tamara Keith,
to analyze the state of the race
for the White

00:26.860 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

00:28.795 --> 00:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And tens of
thousands of Syrians
flee toward the Turkish border,
as the city

00:33.200 --> 00:35.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Aleppo turns into a
battlefield.

00:35.402 --> 00:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
are dying.
We are left with nothing but our
clothes.

00:39.439 --> 00:44.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to be at ease. We want
our dignity.
It's been five years of living
under bombs,

00:44.511 --> 00:45.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crying, "Oh, God."

00:45.879 --> 00:53.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more

JUDY WOODRUFF: The months of
campaigning and
the endless TV ads have all come
to a close

01:06.700 --> 01:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today in New Hampshire. This
primary day means
voters finally have to decide
who wins, and

01:13.006 --> 01:15.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the losers have to decide
whether to go on.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our political director, Lisa
Desjardins, is
in New Hampshire, where she has
watched the

01:19.746 --> 01:21.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
day's events.

LISA DESJARDINS: The campaign
buses rolled
across the Granite State one
last time, and

01:25.786 --> 01:32.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates made one last push to
sway possible
supporters. Many of those voters
admitted

01:32.793 --> 01:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they were last-minute deciders.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JODY MCINTYRE, New Hampshire
Voter: I just
got out of my car and I said,
oh, my God,

01:37.064 --> 01:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who am I going to vote for? Who
am I going
to vote for?

01:39.132 --> 01:42.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For others, it
was more excitement
than angst in their initial
experience with

01:42.736 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the first-in-the-nation primary.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

that it's
time for me to become an
American citizen.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's my right. So I'm doing it.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And what a
state to have
that right.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I know. Live free or die.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Glad you're out so early.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: For the
candidates, it's
more about living to fight on.
Hillary Clinton

02:04.958 --> 02:09.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ventured into a frosty
Manchester morning
to keep volunteers' spirits up
with a selfie

02:09.863 --> 02:12.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or two, and promised her team
won't quit.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We're
going to keep
working literally until every
last vote is

02:15.869 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cast and counted.

02:17.704 --> 02:20.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Rival Bernie
Sanders was
also out, urging along
supporters outside

02:20.974 --> 02:23.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a polling site in Nashua.

02:23.110 --> 02:27.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among Republicans, Marco Rubio
drew a largely
friendly crowd at a polling
site, but a few

02:27.981 --> 02:34.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detractors as well. One showed
up in a robot
costume, a pointed reminder of
criticism that

02:34.221 --> 02:38.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rubio came off too programmed in
last Saturday's
debate.

02:38.492 --> 02:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a later stop, the candidate
made clear
he won't be deterred, regardless
of tonight's

02:43.163 --> 02:44.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
result.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
And then going to South Carolina
and continue

02:46.299 --> 02:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to build, and -- as we get into
the other
states.

02:48.468 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some of his
rivals, too,
insisted they're staying in the
race.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie:

02:54.307 --> 02:55.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
I will see you in South
Carolina.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ohio Governor
John Kasich:

02:57.244 --> 02:58.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, we're going to South
Carolina.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:59.880 --> 03:02.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: We will be
fine.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And former
Florida Governor
Jeb Bush:

03:04.918 --> 03:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: This
is a long, long process, and a
lot of things

03:10.190 --> 03:15.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can happen in a very volatile
year. So, you're
going to see me.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), presidential
candidate:
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I appreciate

03:16.196 --> 03:17.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The man they
have all been
chasing, Donald Trump, had a
light schedule

03:19.966 --> 03:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. And in the end, some who
voted today
said it wasn't about the
outcome, but about

03:22.436 --> 03:24.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
savoring a unique day in
democracy.

03:24.604 --> 03:27.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRAN WHITAKER, New Hampshire
Voter: That's
the most important. It's almost
less important

03:27.274 --> 03:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who wins than that people just
exercise their
right to vote.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: From New
Hampshire, the Democratic
race moves on to the Nevada
caucuses on February

03:34.748 --> 03:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20. The next Republican primary,
that's in
South Carolina the same day.

03:39.953 --> 03:46.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, we're still
waiting to see
what happens this day. And one
factor always

03:46.126 --> 03:50.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is turnout. I have to say, Judy,
the secretary
of state, Bill Gardner, of New
Hampshire expects

03:50.864 --> 03:55.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a heavy turnout. It's been
steady at the polls,
but there's about 900,000
registered voters

03:55.569 --> 04:00.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire. The secretary
of state expects
500,000 of them to have come out
today -- Judy.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can just feel
the excitement
all the way here in Washington.

04:03.944 --> 04:09.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, you were out today at
polling places
talking to voters. What are they
saying to

04:09.749 --> 04:14.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you?
LISA DESJARDINS: You know, there
were some
of the storylines we have been
reporting on.

04:14.287 --> 04:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to many Donald Trump
voters today,
and they told me to a person
that they are

04:19.392 --> 04:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just voting in protest, that
they do believe
Donald Trump could be a strong
president.

04:25.098 --> 04:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked them even further, Judy,
what do you
make of the fact that some
people say they're

04:29.136 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offended by Donald Trump, they
think that
he sort of is too loose of a
cannon? They

04:33.373 --> 04:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said they know that that's true,
but they're
willing to take that risk
because they think

04:37.511 --> 04:41.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
America is in such a weak
position, that they
want a leader like Donald Trump.

04:41.214 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that certainly was something
I came across
at the polls. What surprised me
the most,

04:45.051 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two other Republicans, I heard
the name Jeb
Bush more than I expected, and
also a lot

04:49.890 --> 04:53.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of John Kasich, which we have
been talking
about before. The Jeb Bush
voters I talked

04:53.793 --> 04:58.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to seemed to be people who had
been kind of
having a tough decision between
Bush, Kasich

04:58.932 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Christie.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this last weekend and
even one of them
today in the hour that he voted
decided to

05:05.005 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go with Jeb Bush. He said he
felt that Jeb
Bush was the most presidential,
someone who

05:08.875 --> 05:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stood his ground in the last
debate,but didn't
go on the attack.

05:13.346 --> 05:17.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio, also a name I heard
at the polls,
those voters who said that they
liked Marco

05:17.651 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio on the Republican side
told me that
they felt he was the most
erectable. They

05:21.922 --> 05:26.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said they did in fact have
doubts after his
performance in last -- in this
weekend's debate,

05:26.459 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that they're sticking with
him because
they still think in the long run
he's the

05:29.162 --> 05:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one who can beat a Democrat, the
most likely.

05:31.631 --> 05:35.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, from
looking at these
early exit polls we have been
seeing and how

05:35.402 --> 05:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many Republicans voters say they
made up their
minds just in the last few days,
that gives

05:40.273 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you a sense of the level of how
unsettled
this race is on the Republican
side.

05:44.544 --> 05:47.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lisa, what about on the
Democratic side? What
are you hearing?

05:47.714 --> 05:53.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There, I think
what we have
been talking about, this idea
that Bernie

05:54.020 --> 05:57.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders has caught fire in New
Hampshire,
it's something that I found just
in the few

05:58.058 --> 05:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
polling locations I went to.

05:59.859 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I did voter after voter who
said they
like Bernie Sanders. And I
asked, you know,

06:05.465 --> 06:09.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what do you think about his
electability?
They said, I'm actually not
thinking about

06:09.169 --> 06:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. I think he does have as
much of a chance
as Hillary Clinton, but these
voters, Judy,

06:12.973 --> 06:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told me that they are voting
with their heart.
They're not voting
strategically. They are

06:16.943 --> 06:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanting -- they are voting for
the candidate
that they themselves would put
in office,

06:20.547 --> 06:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether or not they think that's
the candidate
who is most likely to win in
November.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many of those voters I
talked to today,
that was Bernie Sanders.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Lisa, you were
telling me about some of the
radio and television

06:31.124 --> 06:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spots that are playing there in
New Hampshire
here in the final hours?

06:34.527 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be a great sigh of
relief and there
will be many headaches gone
tomorrow when

06:39.799 --> 06:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these ads stop, but, today,
Judy, there have
been even more ads, and some of
them really

06:44.504 --> 06:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even sharper than ever, some of
them getting
into personal lives. I heard one
that was

06:48.408 --> 06:53.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very personal attack on Jeb
Bush, and back
and forth between the
candidates, especially

06:53.847 --> 06:55.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on radio, Judy.

06:55.715 --> 06:59.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have talked about some of the
candidates'
TV ads, but the radio ads are
increasingly

06:59.319 --> 07:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personal and increasingly sharp.
And, of course,
if you drop an ad like that
today, it doesn't

07:04.157 --> 07:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give a candidate a chance to
respond. Now,
that seemed to be coming from
the more conservative

07:08.295 --> 07:10.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wing of the party.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there's something I
want to point
out here, too. When I talked to
Democratic

07:12.699 --> 07:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters today, Judy, all of them
seemed to
indicate, whether they liked
Bernie Sanders

07:16.736 --> 07:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Hillary Clinton, that they
would be happy
with either of those candidates
in the end.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not so on the Republican Party.
And I know
we will get more into this later
into the

07:24.244 --> 07:26.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many Republicans here feel this
is a do-or-die
moment for their wing of the
party. They feel

07:29.649 --> 07:33.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this is a moment where the
party either
has a future or doesn't, and
that's from both

07:33.787 --> 07:37.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sides, conservatives and
moderates, both of
them are concerned that the
other side of

07:37.624 --> 07:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the party will gain momentum
here in New Hampshire.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's
something for
us to chew on.

07:42.662 --> 07:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, Lisa Desjardins, who
is going to
be dashing from campaign hotel
to campaign

07:47.067 --> 07:49.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hotel tonight, thank you.

07:49.336 --> 07:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news, President
Obama sent his eighth and final
budget to

07:55.208 --> 08:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress. The $4.1 trillion
blueprint includes
new spending on cyber-security
and cancer

08:01.247 --> 08:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
research, and a $10-a-barrel tax
on oil to
pay for transportation needs.

08:06.753 --> 08:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hours after it arrived at the
Capitol, the
president touted the plan's
benefits at the

08:11.191 --> 08:13.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The budget that we're releasing
today reflects

08:17.430 --> 08:22.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my priorities and the priorities
that I believe
will help advance security and
prosperity

08:22.702 --> 08:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America for many years to
come. These are
proposals reflected in the
budget that work

08:30.510 --> 08:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for us and not against us.

08:32.379 --> 08:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Republicans
dismissed the
plan before it even arrived on
Capitol Hill.

08:37.350 --> 08:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona Senator John McCain said
there's not
enough spending for defense. And
Mississippi

08:42.255 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Roger Wicker said the
president should
have consulted with GOP leaders
first.

08:46.960 --> 08:52.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. ROGER WICKER (R),
Mississippi: The president's
new budget, his final budget as
president

08:52.732 --> 08:59.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the United States, has
arrived with a resounding
thud here in the Congress of the
United States.

08:59.906 --> 09:06.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This final budget of the Obama
administration
misses the president's final
opportunity to

09:06.679 --> 09:11.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reach out and do big things in a
time of divided
government.

09:11.217 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Republican leaders
pledged to
release their own budget plan in
the coming

09:15.989 --> 09:17.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

09:17.924 --> 09:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The head of U.S.
intelligence
confirmed today that North Korea
has restarted

09:21.294 --> 09:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its plutonium reactor and ramped
up uranium
enrichment. Both are key
components of a nuclear

09:27.700 --> 09:29.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weapons program.

09:29.602 --> 09:34.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The director of national
intelligence, James
Clapper, says the North could
begin recovering

09:34.407 --> 09:38.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plutonium for bomb-making in a
matter of weeks
or months.

09:38.478 --> 09:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Hong Kong, lunar
new year celebrations
erupted into the worst violence
since 2014,

09:45.685 --> 09:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving dozens injured. It
started after police
tried to shut down unlicensed
food vendors.

09:51.224 --> 09:57.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With that, hundreds of
protesters rushed police
lines, hurling bricks and
swinging sticks.

09:57.597 --> 10:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officers fought back with batons
and rounds
of pepper spray. They arrested
more than 60

10:02.936 --> 10:04.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Safety officials
in Southern
Germany are trying to understand
what caused

10:07.907 --> 10:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a deadly train wreck. The crash
today in Bavaria
killed at least 10 people and
injured scores

10:15.081 --> 10:16.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emma Murphy of Independent
Television News
reports from the scene.

10:19.452 --> 10:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: On one of the
safest rail networks
in the world, what's left of two
commuter

10:24.891 --> 10:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trains. They collided at full
speed, just
before 7:00 this morning,
outside the spa

10:29.796 --> 10:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town of Bad Aibling, an hour
from Munich.
It was a head-on collision, both
trains on

10:35.368 --> 10:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same track, the impact
crushing the front
carriages and flipping others
off the tracks.

10:40.673 --> 10:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This mobile phone footage a
glimpse of the
dreadfulness that greeted
emergency services.

10:46.579 --> 10:51.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You
could hear people
screaming for help. You could
hear how glass

10:52.018 --> 10:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was being broken to help people
get out. And
one by one, people were getting
out, covered

10:56.256 --> 10:58.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in blood, limping.

10:58.191 --> 11:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA MURPHY: This is the same
route the trains
were on. It's fitted with an
automatic braking

11:03.229 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
system, which should have
stopped them if
the track wasn't clear. Why it
didn't, whether

11:08.434 --> 11:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through human or technical
failure, is part
of the investigation.

11:12.038 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walking to this site, what
strikes you is
that it's straight all the way,
the rail track

11:17.677 --> 11:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running parallel with the canal,
until you
get to the part where the two
trains collided.

11:22.715 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is where there is something
of a bend.
The trains would have been going
at top speed,

11:27.520 --> 11:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around 60 miles an hour. By the
time they
came out of that bend on the
same track, they

11:32.058 --> 11:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't have had time to stop.
And the investigation
now must establish why they were
in the same

11:37.363 --> 11:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
place at the same time.

11:39.866 --> 11:44.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The crash happened down a
single-track road
between a canal and forest,
which meant huge

11:44.437 --> 11:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems for the 700-strong team
of emergency
service staff. Casualties were
put into small

11:50.610 --> 11:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inflatable ribs to be moved to
helicopters
and ambulances in Germany and
Austria.

11:57.216 --> 12:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dreadful as this day has been,
the only relief
is that more were not killed.
Usually, these

12:01.988 --> 12:07.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trains would be full of
schoolchildren, but
they were off school today for a
carnival.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One person is
still missing
in the wreckage, but officials
had to call

12:11.631 --> 12:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
off the search at nightfall.

12:13.499 --> 12:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Staggering new
numbers today on
the European migrant crisis. The
International

12:18.771 --> 12:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Organization for Migration
reports that more
than 76,000 migrants have
arrived on the continent

12:25.144 --> 12:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by sea just since January 1.
That comes to
nearly 2,000 arrivals a day, and
it's about

12:32.018 --> 12:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 times more than the same
period last year.
More than 400 people have died
in the crossing

12:37.490 --> 12:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempt this year, up from 69 at
this same
time last year.

12:42.028 --> 12:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, Hawaii's
Big Island has declared a state
of emergency

12:46.566 --> 12:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over an outbreak of dengue
fever. There've
been 250 confirmed cases of the
mosquito-borne

12:53.006 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illness since late October, the
most since
the 1940s. The state of
emergency allows landfills

12:59.545 --> 13:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to accept old tires, which are
often breeding
spots for mosquitoes.

13:03.716 --> 13:08.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street
struggled today to
avoid another sell-off. In the
end, the Dow

13:08.554 --> 13:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average lost 12
points to
close at 16014. The Nasdaq fell
15 points,

13:15.928 --> 13:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 dropped one.

13:18.398 --> 13:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And thousands of
people had
to brave cold winds in New
Orleans today for

13:23.336 --> 13:28.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the climax of Mardi Gras.
Despite the chill,
revelers filled the streets of
the Big Easy

13:28.741 --> 13:34.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to enjoy traditional parades,
elaborate floats
and all the beads they could
catch. The celebrations

13:34.881 --> 13:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mark the culmination of the
Carnival season
as Lent is ushered in.

13:40.286 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how New Hampshire
will change the race for the
Republican nomination;

13:46.325 --> 13:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrians stranded on the Turkish
border as
government forces bear down on
Aleppo; plus,

13:50.596 --> 13:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a look at Detroit's crumbling
schools.

13:57.970 --> 14:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After the votes are
counted today,
Republicans will be one step
closer to settling

14:10.149 --> 14:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a nominee. But there may be
even more at
stake, as distinct factions
fight for the

14:15.788 --> 14:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
future of the Grand Old Party.

14:18.224 --> 14:21.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins is back
with that from New Hampshire.

14:21.828 --> 14:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The clusters of
signs and
intense campaigning show a
Republican race

14:29.268 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has been unpredictable,
even by New Hampshire
standards.

LISA DESJARDINS: Phone banks are
in high gear
at Cruz headquarters in
Manchester. Their

14:39.979 --> 14:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate may have won Iowa, but
he has not
been the headline here.

14:46.986 --> 14:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The slightly younger senator
from Florida
is. Marco Rubio has seemed to
find his groove

14:52.024 --> 14:53.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a big response at his
events.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Hillary Clinton attacks me more
than any other

14:56.763 --> 15:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican because she doesn't
want to run
against me, but I can't wait to
run against

15:01.601 --> 15:02.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

15:04.103 --> 15:08.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: But his
performance at Saturday's
debate has raised a new question
mark.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: This notion
that Barack
Obama doesn't know what he's
doing is just

15:10.910 --> 15:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not true. He knows exactly what
he's doing.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
There it is. There it is, the
memorized 25-second

15:14.280 --> 15:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

one from the super PAC

have to go to my robotic talking
points.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

been on the
attack.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

old and wrong.

15:30.696 --> 15:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With his super

after Bush in one ad.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

His tax plan.

well be Obama's

15:44.977 --> 15:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Chris Christie
in still one
more.

15:47.980 --> 15:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio has found himself in the
middle of a
much larger party divide here in
New Hampshire.

15:52.518 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While, in Iowa, some 85 percent
of Republicans
call themselves conservative,
here in New

15:57.857 --> 16:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire, roughly half of
Republicans identify
as moderate or liberal. That
makes this vote

16:03.396 --> 16:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not just a fight between

opposing party philosophies.

STEVE MAC DONALD, GrokTALK!:
Welcome to another
edition of GrokTALK!. It is
February already.

16:11.170 --> 16:16.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Steve Mac Donald hosts
GrokTALK!. It's a home-grown
conservative radio show in
Concord that is

16:16.576 --> 16:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actively supporting Ted Cruz.
Mac Donald actually
embraces the label "extreme,"
because he says

16:25.785 --> 16:30.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans in office, like
Rubio and Chris
Christie, have become
compromised.

16:30.189 --> 16:35.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE MAC DONALD: We are extreme
because we
believe in smaller government,
local control.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We'd rather keep the money here
and go talk
to our legislators and our town
councils about

16:40.066 --> 16:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to spend the money. And
there is an extreme
difference in that philosophy,
and that's

16:43.302 --> 16:45.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why extremist is an appropriate
word.

16:45.137 --> 16:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But these
Republicans see
the word extremist as the
problem.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Renee Plummer is here to win
business votes
for Chris Christie, along with
his wife, Mary

16:53.980 --> 16:55.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Pat.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE: There are
some people
who, based on their life
experience, their

16:57.750 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
work experience, their
experience in public
life, are prepared and ready to
take on Hillary

17:02.188 --> 17:05.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Clinton and then become
president of the United
States. And some people are not.

17:05.224 --> 17:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Christie is
considered establishment
by some, and Plummer says that
shouldn't be

17:10.162 --> 17:11.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a bad thing.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RENEE PLUMMER, Real Estate
Developer: When
you talk about the Constitution,
the Declaration

17:14.000 --> 17:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Independence, the Bill of
Rights, you're
talking about establishment. At
some point,

17:17.837 --> 17:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something has to be established.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Plummer is a
real estate
developer. At her home in
Portsmouth, she

17:22.775 --> 17:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows me photos of the must-do
luncheons that
she hosts for nearly every
candidate.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RENEE PLUMMER: So, Governor
Scott Walker was
the first one.

17:29.949 --> 17:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: She fears that
the right
wing of the party only wants
control, not

17:33.653 --> 17:35.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
results or compromise.

17:35.554 --> 17:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RENEE PLUMMER: I think people
become very
selfish, you know? They want
their small group

17:41.727 --> 17:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the ones that are going to
dominate.
How are you going to govern if
you think that

17:46.799 --> 17:50.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
your group is right, and
everybody else is
wrong? It's not going to work.

17:50.870 --> 17:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Dante Scala is
a professor
at the University of New
Hampshire who's written

17:55.174 --> 17:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a book on the Republican divide.

17:57.710 --> 18:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the 2016 GOP fight
highlights a real
problem for the party and its
presidential

18:04.684 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidates.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANTE SCALA, University of New
Hampshire:
So, the Republicans are
grappling with both

18:08.554 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left-right divisions, but then
in vs. out.
And so that's complicating
things. So, Republicans

18:13.559 --> 18:19.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have become very good at
building a coalition
of voters that excels in
midterms, when the

18:19.632 --> 18:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
electorate is older and whiter,
but they are
having real problems building a
coalition

18:25.504 --> 18:27.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that can win presidential
elections.

18:27.873 --> 18:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Here's what the
divide means
in today's primary. The hard
right is pushing

18:32.511 --> 18:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Cruz and Ben Carson, but
that's just 20
percent of Republicans here. The
bigger group

18:38.284 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire is moderates.

18:40.353 --> 18:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting for those votes are
three governors,
John Kasich, Christie and Bush.
Hoping to

18:45.091 --> 18:50.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gain from both sides are
hard-to-define Donald
Trump and Rubio, who is both
conservative

18:50.529 --> 18:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and established. This all makes
for a particularly
wild intraparty fight for
voters, from moderates.

18:57.670 --> 19:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL EDMONDS, New Hampshire
Voter: It's directionally
incorrect with the guys like
Trump and Cruz,

19:03.843 --> 19:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think. You need -- quote --
"more establishment"
kind of guys like Kasich and
Christie or Bush.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: To Trump
voters.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUITE, New Hampshire
Voter: It needs
somebody that's got some balls,
who is not

19:15.955 --> 19:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a regular politician, and can
get this country
back on course.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: To
conservatives.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT HODGMAN, New Hampshire
Voter: This
country is slipping away from
the Constitution

19:23.262 --> 19:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very rapidly. And if we don't
win this election,
we're going to have a lot of
problems.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And to the
seemingly many
late-deciders.

19:30.136 --> 19:34.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD TUITE, New Hampshire
Voter: Actually,
I really don't have to make up
my mind yet.

19:34.907 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: New Hampshire
has been a
sprint for candidates to try and
stay in the

19:40.046 --> 19:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican race, and it's a test
likely to
swing at the last minute.

19:45.317 --> 19:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Manchester for the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Lisa Desjardins.

19:48.154 --> 19:52.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We look at what's at
stake for
both Republicans and Democrats
now with Tamara

19:52.691 --> 19:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keith of NPR, who joins us from
Manchester,
and Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report,

19:57.563 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who is here with me.

19:59.465 --> 20:05.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Tam, in these last days
going into the
way this whole thing is sorted
out, who seems

20:05.337 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- which candidate seems the
most nervous
tonight?

20:08.040 --> 20:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Hmm.
I think that's a very good
question.

20:12.778 --> 20:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think a lot of -- on the
Democratic
side, Hillary Clinton doesn't
have a lot of

20:16.549 --> 20:20.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nervousness, because there's a
resignation
to the way things are going to
turn out. It's

20:20.986 --> 20:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the margin of victory for
Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders.

20:26.192 --> 20:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, I think
that someone
like Chris Christie has to be
hoping that

20:30.930 --> 20:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something will happen. John
Kasich has been
relaxed out on the trail today.
So, it's -- and

20:39.905 --> 20:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, he probably has a
lot to be
nervous about, because he has
been -- he has

20:44.043 --> 20:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these huge poll numbers, but, in
Iowa, that
didn't translate into a win, and
he sure has

20:51.217 --> 20:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to hope to get a win tonight.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It's really
interesting.

20:54.520 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, we have seen first wave of
exit polls
today from today's voting, which
tells us

21:00.126 --> 21:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot about who voted and when
they vote -- when
they decided to vote.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm looking for a lot of
things in these
exit polls, but one of the most
interesting

21:07.766 --> 21:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the independent voters,
people who do not
define themselves as Democrat or
Republican.

21:12.905 --> 21:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can vote in these primaries
as long as
they pick one ballot.

21:16.308 --> 21:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Republican side, 42
percent of
the people who turned out to
vote identified

21:22.248 --> 21:26.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Republican -- I'm sorry -- as
independent;
39 percent on the Democratic
side identified

21:26.585 --> 21:27.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as independent.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Pretty close.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's pretty close.
The news
for Kasich -- and I agree with
Tamara -- he

21:32.391 --> 21:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is hoping for a good night here
-- he needs
a big turnout among
independents.

21:36.128 --> 21:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, the turnout among
independents was
almost 50 percent. Back in 2008,
it was 37

21:41.734 --> 21:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent. So, it's somewhere
right in the middle
there. It's probably a good
number for Kasich.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The question is if it is good
enough.

21:47.339 --> 21:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the other question
about who is nervous
tonight, Marco Rubio has to be
very, very

21:50.943 --> 21:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nervous. He came into Iowa with
a head of
steam. As we saw in this report,
he's been

21:55.781 --> 22:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggling since the debate to
get that momentum
back. If he falls behind a
Kasich, a Jeb in

22:03.022 --> 22:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this primary, it's going to be a
very difficult
pivot for him to say that he's
the candidate

22:10.563 --> 22:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now who has the momentum going
into South
Carolina.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As we saw, everybody
says they're
going to South Carolina, but
that doesn't

22:16.502 --> 22:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessarily mean they're all
going to South
Carolina.

22:18.270 --> 22:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara, you know, we were in New
Hampshire
in 1992, when Bill Clinton
declared himself

22:24.376 --> 22:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the comeback kid. We were there
in 2008, where
it looked like all the polls
showed that Barack

22:31.016 --> 22:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama was going to win, and he
didn't. Hillary
Clinton did.

22:34.553 --> 22:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What going into -- behind you in
the scene
-- set there is the Trump bus,
by the way.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm just letting you know.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:41.694 --> 22:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What, going into
tonight's voting
and tonight's vote-counting, are
we watching

22:44.930 --> 22:46.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for, for a comeback?

22:46.799 --> 22:53.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, this
morning, I interviewed
a couple of voters at a polling
place who

22:53.305 --> 22:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that they had heard from
the Hillary
Clinton campaign, got knocks on
their doors

22:57.009 --> 22:58.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
while they were still in
pajamas.

22:58.877 --> 23:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Clinton campaign is
definitely still
efforting this and trying to get
people out.

23:04.083 --> 23:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I asked one of her campaign
officials,
what are you looking for? What
are you hoping

23:09.255 --> 23:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for? There was no hint of hoping
for a win.
It was all about how -- whether
maybe they

23:15.361 --> 23:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could get the win for Vermont
Senator Bernie
Sanders into single digits,
maybe.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: And there is
something telling
about the fact that Hillary
Clinton went up

23:23.569 --> 23:31.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today with an ad in South
Carolina talking
about racial injustice and
systemic racism,

23:31.143 --> 23:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not a very -- not a subtle
shift, we're talking.

23:33.379 --> 23:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, the strategy for
the Hillary
Clinton people have -- they have
already...

23:37.249 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:39.151 --> 23:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: They are basically,
like, let's
just go into South Carolina,
where we know

23:41.020 --> 23:45.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the terrain is much more
comfortable for us.
We know that we're going to have
to win over

23:45.424 --> 23:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-American voters, do very
well among
this group.

23:48.694 --> 23:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's already been running an ad
featuring
former Attorney General Eric
Holder, now going

23:53.565 --> 23:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in with this on police violence
and other
issues.

23:57.336 --> 24:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, one of the big
names coming
out of Iowa only a week ago was
Ted Cruz.

24:01.607 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we haven't heard as much
about him in
this New Hampshire week. Where
has he been,

24:07.146 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and where is he expected to
land?

24:08.947 --> 24:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, this is less
familiar,
less friendly territory for him.
He really

24:14.420 --> 24:19.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has been running as an
evangelical in Iowa,
which is a great thing in Iowa.

24:19.591 --> 24:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in New Hampshire, voters
have different
sensibilities. And he has been
really trying

24:25.731 --> 24:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lower expectations heading
into this vote.
I think that his campaign really
believes

24:32.104 --> 24:36.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have strengths in the
states that
come after this, in the Southern
states, in

24:36.208 --> 24:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina. I think that
they feel like
they will be on much more
friendly terrain

24:41.146 --> 24:43.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
once they get out of New
Hampshire.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And speaking of
South Carolina,
you mentioned what Hillary
Clinton was already

24:45.918 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing on the air there, Amy. We
heard today
that Bernie Sanders is meeting
tomorrow in

24:52.057 --> 24:54.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
New York with Al Sharpton.

24:54.126 --> 24:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, people are beginning
to change
their approach to this.

24:57.196 --> 25:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right. We're
going from
Iowa, New Hampshire,
overwhelmingly white

25:01.066 --> 25:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, not diverse at all, now
into Southern
states like South Carolina. We
will go to

25:06.472 --> 25:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevada as well, which is very
heavily Latino,
and then into some of these
Southern states.

25:11.310 --> 25:15.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The terrain changes. It's
supposed to be a
better terrain for Hillary
Clinton on a whole

25:15.414 --> 25:18.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bunch of measures, but
demography being the
most important.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I saw in one of
these exit polls,
Amy, that a lot of people who
self-described

25:22.321 --> 25:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves as liberals were
involved -- a
lot of self-described liberals
voted in this

25:26.191 --> 25:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election. Does that change, as
well, also
as they leave New Hampshire?

25:29.661 --> 25:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I think, as we leave
New Hampshire
and even as we leave Iowa, we're
going to

25:33.165 --> 25:34.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get to a more moderate
electorate.

25:35.067 --> 25:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what is different
even this year
than it was in 2008, certainly
when we saw

25:39.671 --> 25:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the comeback kid in 1992, the
Democratic electorate
is much more liberal than it has
been at any

25:46.245 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
previous point. And so this has
been the challenge
for Hillary Clinton, trying to
keep up with

25:50.682 --> 25:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a party that keeps moving to the
left. It's
not the party that it was back
in the '90s.

25:55.788 --> 25:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Tam, does the
more moderate
electorate in New Hampshire also
speak to

25:59.725 --> 26:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one part of the reason why John
Kasich at
least is the subject of buzz,
whether he will

26:03.462 --> 26:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be the subject of votes tonight?

26:05.864 --> 26:12.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, that, and
that independents
can vote in a different party.

26:12.604 --> 26:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think John Kasich's recipe
here is that
he would pull Democratic-leaning
independents

26:19.178 --> 26:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote for him here. This is a
place that's
really a sweet spot for him,
where some of

26:24.049 --> 26:28.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his positions on, like,
expanding Medicaid
and things like that wouldn't
necessarily

26:28.520 --> 26:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be as much of a problem for him
as in some
other places.

26:30.989 --> 26:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, nose to the
grindstone up
there in New Hampshire tonight.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks for joining us, Tam.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And thank you here in
Washington, Amy Walter.

26:38.730 --> 26:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we break
down some
interesting facts and figures
from New Hampshire

26:44.436 --> 26:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that aren't voting results.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's Hari Sreenivasan.

26:48.474 --> 26:51.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Our data team
looked at
what the numbers say about New
Hampshire going

26:51.510 --> 26:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into tonight's primary results.
How does the
Granite State compare to the
rest of the country,

26:55.180 --> 27:00.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, on social media, what are
New Hampshirites
saying about this year's
presidential election?

27:00.285 --> 27:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Compared to Iowa and most of the
country,
New Hampshire is whiter and more
wealthy,

27:04.890 --> 27:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
according to the Census Bureau;
94 percent
of the voting-age population is
white, vs.

27:10.062 --> 27:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
66 percent of the U.S. And the
median household
income is $66,532. That's
$12,000 more than

27:18.537 --> 27:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the amount you find nationwide.

27:20.439 --> 27:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there are fewer people
in poverty
in New Hampshire as well. The
national poverty

27:25.177 --> 27:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate is nearly 14 percent,
almost twice as
high as what's found in New
Hampshire, slightly

27:30.249 --> 27:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 8 percent. And they're
more politically
active. Among New Hampshire
residents age

27:35.721 --> 27:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
18 or older, the census says
nearly three
out of four are registered to
vote, compared

27:40.692 --> 27:42.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to about two out of three
Americans.

27:42.761 --> 27:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's on the minds of New
Hampshire voters
as this year's election gains
momentum? Just

27:47.299 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like in Iowa last week, Facebook
users in
this small New England state
have more to

27:51.270 --> 27:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say about Donald Trump than any
other presidential
contender, Republican or
Democrat. Next, there's

27:56.775 --> 28:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz, who won last week's
Iowa GOP caucus,
and then Marco Rubio and Jeb
Bush.

28:02.247 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The presidential race's two
Democrats, Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders,
follow Trump in

28:07.352 --> 28:10.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generating interest on Facebook
there.

28:10.422 --> 28:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regarding issues that most
concern New Hampshire
voters, conversation on Facebook
may offer

28:14.826 --> 28:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some clues. Campaign finance is
the most important
topic among Facebook users in
New Hampshire

28:20.799 --> 28:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading up to today's primary
vote. Next,
New Hampshirites are talking
about taxes,

28:25.437 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the economy, Wall Street, and
same-sex marriage.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when New Hampshirites want
to learn more
about this year's candidates,
what are they

28:32.778 --> 28:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Googling? According to the
search engine's
News Lab, interest in Rubio
peaked after his

28:38.250 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate performance Saturday, and
top-trending
questions among New Hampshire
residents include,

28:44.022 --> 28:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Marco Rubio Catholic and is
Ben Carson
pro-choice?

28:47.426 --> 28:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an effort to influence the
hearts and minds,
campaign and special interest
groups are buying

28:52.898 --> 28:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lots of ads in New Hampshire.
The Boston Globe
reported that, since December,
more ads have

28:58.604 --> 29:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aired in New Hampshire both for
and against
Jeb Bush than anyone else.
Interestingly,

29:03.742 --> 29:07.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ted Cruz was featured in the
fewest ads.

29:07.112 --> 29:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight's vote in New England
will show if
those ad dollars make a
difference.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks, Hari.

29:12.451 --> 29:16.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that brings us to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark

29:16.421 --> 29:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shields and New York Times
columnist David
Brooks, who joins us from
Manchester.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

29:22.894 --> 29:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, David, we were just hearing
in that report
from Hari how different the
voters of New

29:27.432 --> 29:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hampshire are from the rest of
the country.

29:29.501 --> 29:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at Iowa and you
put it together
with New Hampshire, you are
looking at a different

29:35.040 --> 29:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of the electorate. So,
what are you
looking for these voters to
clarify tonight?

29:39.411 --> 29:44.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Obviously,
they're polarized.
They're whiter, but then they're
also more

29:44.349 --> 29:46.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
polarized.

29:46.251 --> 29:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting to me is,
this electorate,
according to the exit polls, are
more polarized

29:48.553 --> 29:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than they were in '08. The
Democrats are much
more liberal, significantly more
liberal than

29:52.658 --> 29:57.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they were in '08. The
Republicans are significantly
more who say they extremely
conservative than

29:57.462 --> 29:59.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in '12 and '08.

29:59.431 --> 30:03.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is an electorate, like
a lot of people
around the country, who have
polarized. I'm

30:03.535 --> 30:08.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also struck by how many
late-deciders there
are. If it's half late-deciders,
that means

30:09.074 --> 30:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all that we have been talking
about in the
polls, I would be very surprised
if we weren't

30:12.878 --> 30:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very surprised by what happens
in the next
few hours.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, what about
that, the
late-deciders, and also the
difference? Well,

30:19.184 --> 30:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and let me ask you first about
the late-deciders.
What does that tell you?

30:21.787 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The late-deciders
tell me that
it's typical New Hampshire,
where you get

30:25.557 --> 30:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- in the last 72 hours, 48
hours, you get
up to half of the voters
deciding.

30:31.830 --> 30:38.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one measurement I saw
reported is that
two-thirds of the voters said
that the debates,

30:38.203 --> 30:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which were last Thursday for the
Democrats,
last Saturday for the
Republicans, influenced

30:42.908 --> 30:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their decision in that late
decision.

30:46.078 --> 30:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that will be a major
part of the
postmortem of the results
tonight.

30:52.884 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, what
about this
question of, what are you
looking for the

30:56.988 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
results in New Hampshire to
clarify? I mean,
this is a different group of
voters from the

31:01.660 --> 31:03.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rest of the country.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a different
group of voters,
Judy. It has always been a
different group

31:05.464 --> 31:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of voters. It is the gateway and
the gatekeeper
state.

31:09.434 --> 31:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of the last 10 presidents of the
United States,
from Harry Truman forward,
Dwight Eisenhower

31:14.606 --> 31:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Barack Obama, nobody has been
elected president
of the United States who
finished lower than

31:19.745 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second in the New Hampshire
primary or won
it, either won it or finished
second.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, maybe history will be broken
tonight,
and somebody who finishes fourth
will go on

31:28.887 --> 31:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the nominee. But history
is a very strong
indication that, if you don't
finish in the

31:34.726 --> 31:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top two in New Hampshire, you're
not going
to have an inaugural parade next
January 20.

31:39.831 --> 31:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that's what I'm
looking for as
much as anything.

31:44.169 --> 31:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would also look for, quite
frankly, Marco
Rubio, who was running second in
the polls

31:50.308 --> 31:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immediately after Iowa and a
stronger-than-expected
showing, if, in fact, he does
tumble to beyond

31:56.982 --> 32:01.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fourth, or third, fifth in this
tonight, I
think the story has already been
written.

32:01.586 --> 32:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The narrative is there. It was
the debate
that did it to him, just as
Howard Dean's

32:05.624 --> 32:11.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
scream in 2004 became the
explanation for
his fall from grace.

32:11.163 --> 32:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David,
that's a reminder
that, tonight, we don't just
look at who the

32:15.534 --> 32:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winners are in each party. We're
going to
be looking closely at who comes
in second,

32:19.571 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
third and maybe even fourth.

32:21.306 --> 32:23.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

32:23.341 --> 32:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the results, and then
there's the
narrative. And the narratives
will be determined

32:27.579 --> 32:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the size of the victory. If
Donald Trump,
his final poll numbers around
31, if he's

32:32.918 --> 32:38.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down around 25, 24, 22, then we
will have
a pattern of underperformance.
If he's above

32:38.156 --> 32:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
31, then suddenly he looks quite
strong.

32:40.258 --> 32:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If John Kasich comes in second,
suddenly,
we have got fresh meat. We have
got a new

32:44.362 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story to talk about. If Bernie
Sanders can
win -- right now, he's winning
by like 15

32:48.600 --> 32:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the polls. And -- but if he
wins by 25,
suddenly, that's a huge story.
If somehow

32:53.572 --> 32:55.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he loses, he's done.

32:55.607 --> 33:00.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we will -- the gaps
between all the
candidates will determine the
narrative structure

33:00.579 --> 33:02.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the next few weeks.

33:02.480 --> 33:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, are you
hearing from
these candidates an evolving
message? Do you

33:07.986 --> 33:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear them saying the same kinds
of things
they were weeks ago? Or do you
see something

33:13.158 --> 33:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
developing from these candidates
that tells
us more about them?

33:16.995 --> 33:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, Donald
Trump evolves
in random ways, but I don't know
that that's

33:25.070 --> 33:27.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
developing.

33:27.105 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting is how much
-- you know,
the polls to me about
immigration on the Republican

33:30.108 --> 33:34.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
side are very disturbing.
Two-thirds of Republicans
here would like to have a
temporary ban on

33:34.412 --> 33:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all Muslims. On the other hand,
immigration
is not a very salient issue.
It's not one

33:39.351 --> 33:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the top concerns. Economy is
really the
top concern on both sides.

33:43.088 --> 33:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Republican side,
Kasich and Trump
are getting the highest ratings
on the economy.

33:48.026 --> 33:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they focus on that. But I
guess the thing
that's most interesting to me,
as in the whole

33:53.632 --> 33:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign, is the electorate is
more interesting
than the candidates.

33:56.234 --> 33:57.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:58.069 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: There are a lot of
people who
are Democrats who just want to
stop Cruz or

34:00.338 --> 34:04.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop Trump, so they're switching
over to vote
on the Republican side, even
though they might

34:04.509 --> 34:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be progressives themselves.

34:06.444 --> 34:09.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is
interesting, Mark, the
number of -- what we have been
hearing reporters

34:09.414 --> 34:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say. They talk to voters who
say, well, I'm
either going to go Trump or
Sanders, or they

34:13.451 --> 34:15.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will name a Democrat or a
Republican.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

34:17.088 --> 34:22.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are we
learning in this
process about just how unhappy
the American

34:22.894 --> 34:26.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people are? Do we better
understand the appeal
of these outsider candidates?

34:26.197 --> 34:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think
Trump and Sanders,
you could say they -- these are
very much

34:30.468 --> 34:37.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outsider candidates, I mean, who
are politics
as usual, Washington, the
political establishment

34:37.108 --> 34:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- they give cold comfort to
members of that
group or that organization. They
are both

34:46.952 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outsiders. They're both highly
critical. They
-- I think that is a major
thing.

34:53.558 --> 34:59.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just one point about New
Hampshire, Judy.
Today, they had a snowstorm.
They will have

34:59.698 --> 35:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a turnout in New Hampshire, if
history is
our guide again, that will be
higher than

35:04.903 --> 35:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all but 44 states in November, I
mean, in
a primary in February.

35:09.975 --> 35:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these are people who
take it seriously,
take their responsibility
seriously. And,

35:15.313 --> 35:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they really do a rather
remarkable
job. So, their decision is --
has to be paid

35:20.485 --> 35:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attention to, and it will have
enormous implications.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
paying attention.

35:26.224 --> 35:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, you mentioned -- we were
talking about
Trump a minute ago. There's been
a lot of

35:29.694 --> 35:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coverage today of the remark
that he made
last night which everyone has
bleeped out,

35:36.401 --> 35:42.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at least all the news
organizations have bleeped
out. And yet the crowd cheered.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we learn from that?

35:44.376 --> 35:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Part of his appeal
is anti-political
correctness.

35:50.348 --> 35:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He understands that to show that
you're against
the establishment is not only to
show it on

35:54.185 --> 35:59.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
positions. You show it on
manners. And, so,
in my view, he's taken the
manners of professional

35:59.391 --> 36:03.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wrestling. He's in the
Professional Wrestling
Hall of Fame, and he's brought
it to politics.

36:03.294 --> 36:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the word he used last
night was another
-- yet another example of that.
And people

36:09.200 --> 36:13.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like me tut-tut about it, but
the crowd cheered.
There is a certain number of
people who say,

36:14.005 --> 36:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
well, that's how I talk, too.

36:15.774 --> 36:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, should we
draw bigger
conclusions or just say, this is
just one

36:19.644 --> 36:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rally, one Donald Trump remark?

36:21.513 --> 36:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, if Donald
Trump wins,
as the polls predict that he
will, I mean,

36:26.151 --> 36:28.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he has to be taken more
seriously, Judy.

36:28.720 --> 36:36.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is such a departure
from how Americans
regard their presidents, whether
it's George

36:36.661 --> 36:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington or Abraham Lincoln or
anybody who
served in that office. We expect
a level of

36:44.002 --> 36:49.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civility. We expect a level of
discourse.
And Donald Trump, by any
measurement, is not

36:49.374 --> 36:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
presidential by that standard.

36:52.610 --> 36:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there's matter of
taste, as well
as sensibilities, that he
offends an awful

36:57.315 --> 37:02.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lot of people. I will be
interested in the
exit polls and how many people
who don't vote

37:02.921 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Donald Trump tonight have an
unfavorable
view of him. Remember, in Iowa,
a majority

37:07.592 --> 37:13.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Republicans who didn't
support Donald Trump
had an unfavorable view of him.

37:13.531 --> 37:19.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, of course, would, I
think, be a
reflection of his manner, his
approach, his

37:19.137 --> 37:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attitude, his disparagement of
his opponents,
and just calling everybody who
has ever served

37:24.375 --> 37:30.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Washington in the past
generation stupid.
And that -- I think that there
are consequences

37:30.548 --> 37:32.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, David, just
quickly, does
this campaign feels -- we have
been saying

37:35.086 --> 37:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this for months, that this
campaign feels
like a different one.

37:38.556 --> 37:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you go into tonight's voting,
tonight's
results still feeling that this
is -- this

37:43.962 --> 37:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stands out as something really
different from
what we have seen over the past
few decades

37:48.967 --> 37:49.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of this?

37:49.734 --> 37:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. We have...

37:50.368 --> 37:52.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: We have certainly
broken every
rule of etiquette. We have
certainly had the

37:55.240 --> 37:57.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
confusion of candidates.

37:57.108 --> 38:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess I'm mostly struck by how
nothing will
be settled. We may be more
confused tomorrow

38:01.212 --> 38:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than we are today if we get
another scramble
of new candidates, a Kasich or a
Bush rising.

38:05.283 --> 38:09.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, usually, there's a
winnowing and
a clarifying. We may be more
confused after

38:09.821 --> 38:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Hampshire, at least on the
Republican
side.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

38:13.224 --> 38:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And we will find
out, Judy,
whether, in fact, there is such
a thing as

38:15.794 --> 38:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a firewall after tonight. If, in
fact, Bernie
Sanders wins big, if he gets the
big mo' of

38:22.767 --> 38:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legendary American political
lore, and starts
to move, and even in areas where
he's unknown

38:29.874 --> 38:31.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
previously.

38:31.609 --> 38:34.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we look
forward to having
Mark and David with us all
evening.

38:34.579 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you.

38:38.116 --> 38:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And stay with us. We will have a
lot more
on the New Hampshire primary on
our "PBS NewsHour"

38:42.654 --> 38:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
special report. That's at 11:00
p.m. Eastern.

38:45.557 --> 38:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, tune in on Thursday. Gwen
and I will
moderate the Democratic
presidential debate,

38:50.695 --> 38:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in partnership with Facebook,
from the University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. That
starts Thursday

38:55.867 --> 39:02.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

39:02.440 --> 39:16.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: American
intelligence officials
told a Senate hearing today that
Russia's

39:16.721 --> 39:22.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombing campaign in Syria has
stabilized the
regime of President Bashar
al-Assad and turned

39:22.660 --> 39:27.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tide of the five-year civil
war against
U.S.-backed rebel forces.

39:28.099 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is most apparent in Aleppo
in Northern
Syria, where tens of thousands
have fled as

39:33.204 --> 39:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Syrian army closes in.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
William Brangham reports.

39:37.475 --> 39:43.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is
everyday Aleppo
now. Sirens wail as rescue crews
rush to the

39:43.881 --> 39:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scene of yet another airstrike,
believed to
be the work of Russian
warplanes.

39:47.785 --> 39:53.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
have the planes
over us. We have the rockets
over us. We are

39:53.524 --> 39:58.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dying. We are left with nothing,
but our clothes.
We want to be at ease. We want
our dignity.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been five years of living
under bombs,
crying, "Oh, God."

40:02.467 --> 40:06.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Syrian
government troops,
backed by a barrage of Russian
airstrikes,

40:06.371 --> 40:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are fighting their way closer
and closer to
Aleppo. The United Nations warns
that 300,000

40:11.476 --> 40:16.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are at risk of being
trapped inside
what was once Syria's largest
city.

40:16.214 --> 40:21.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rami Jarrah is a Syrian
journalist and activist
now in Istanbul, Turkey. He was
in Aleppo

40:21.986 --> 40:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just two weeks ago, and spoke
with us today
via Skype.

40:25.056 --> 40:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI JARRAH, Syrian Journalist:
In the center
of the city, what we are seeing
is an escalation,

40:30.862 --> 40:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, mainly the marketplaces, the
local, heavily
populated residential areas are
being attacked.

40:35.333 --> 40:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As a result,
the World Food
Program reported today that
conditions are

40:39.437 --> 40:41.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rapidly getting worse.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETTINA LUESCHER, World Food
Program: We are
extremely concerned about the
situation on

40:43.341 --> 40:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ground. We are worried about
access and
supply routes from the north to
eastern Aleppo

40:49.013 --> 40:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been cut off. We are
making every
effort to get food to the
people.

40:54.052 --> 40:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Desperate to
escape, tens
of thousands of Syrians are
trying to flee

40:57.789 --> 41:02.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the short, but difficult
distance north to
Turkey, only to find the border
cordoned off.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM SPINDLER, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: Many people are
not being allowed

41:04.829 --> 41:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cross the border, and we are
asking Turkey
to open its border to all
civilians from Syria

41:12.170 --> 41:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are fleeing danger and
seeking international
protection.

41:15.073 --> 41:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over the last
few years,
the Turks have already taken in
some 2.5 million

41:20.745 --> 41:25.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Syrian refugees. Turkey's
foreign minister
said today his government has
started taking

41:25.450 --> 41:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some of the 50,000 Syrians
massed at the
border, but he warned that
influx could become

41:31.723 --> 41:33.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a torrent.

41:33.424 --> 41:35.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MEVLUT CAVUSOGLU, Turkish
Foreign Minister
(through translator): We
admitted 10,000,

41:35.827 --> 41:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but for the others, we will set
up camps on
the other side of the border. We
can only

41:39.964 --> 41:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let them through in a controlled
fashion.
If airstrikes continue, the
refugee flood

41:44.102 --> 41:46.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could reach 100,000 or even one
million.

41:46.471 --> 41:50.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Russia
insisted today there
is no credible evidence that its
airstrikes

41:50.274 --> 41:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have caused civilian deaths.

41:52.276 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Rami Jarrah says the view on
the ground
in Aleppo is decidedly
different.

41:56.347 --> 42:00.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI JARRAH: There is extreme
fear amongst
the civilians there. They are
totally disabling

42:00.752 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the movement there. So, if there
is any small
form of commerce or sort of
business trade

42:06.157 --> 42:11.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is happening in these areas
that people
can live off, they are also
destroying that.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are scaring the rest of
the civilians
there.

42:14.332 --> 42:18.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are willing to hit
hospitals, willing
to hit local councils, aid
communities, the

42:18.736 --> 42:22.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil defense, for example. Then
they are
willing to kill anyone.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Underscoring
that point,
a humanitarian group calling
itself Syria

42:26.044 --> 42:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Civil Defense posted these
images online showing
the aftermath of a Russian
attack on a refugee

42:31.549 --> 42:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
camp in northern Aleppo. At
least five people
were killed.

42:36.754 --> 42:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fierce bombardment has also
taken a heavy
toll elsewhere, according to
humanitarian

42:40.825 --> 42:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activist Mohammad Al-Hamseh.
He's witnessed
the scope of Russia's aerial
onslaught firsthand

42:46.130 --> 42:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
farther south in the town of
Talbiseh, near
the city of Homs.

42:49.333 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD AL-HAMSEH, Humanitarian
Activist
(through translator): Russian
planes are bombarding

42:52.937 --> 42:59.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the morning and evening,
inflicting damage
to civilians here. They are
killing and hurting

42:59.544 --> 43:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilians daily and also bombing
what are
supposed to be safe areas in the
town of Talbiseh.

43:06.751 --> 43:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In regards to the humanitarian
situation,
it is very, very bad. There is
no way for

43:11.889 --> 43:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any food or supplies to reach
this area, from
sugar to flour to oil or
gasoline.

43:17.161 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Faced with
this escalation,
the U.N.-backed Syrian peace
talks in Geneva

43:21.499 --> 43:24.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stalled last week.

43:24.135 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington today, U.S.
Secretary of State
John Kerry said Moscow's
military campaign

43:29.040 --> 43:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Syria has jeopardized any
prospect for
peace.

43:31.709 --> 43:35.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Russia's
activities in Aleppo and in the
region right

43:35.379 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now are making it much more
difficult to be
able to come to the table and be
able to have

43:43.020 --> 43:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a serious conversation. And we
have called
on Russia, and we call on Russia
again, to

43:48.793 --> 43:54.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
join in the effort to bring
about an immediate
cease-fire and to bring about
full humanitarian

43:54.866 --> 43:56.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
access.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

44:00.471 --> 44:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, to Detroit,
and a city
school system in turmoil,
plagued with decrepit

44:15.853 --> 44:21.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
buildings, financial
uncertainty, a chronic
lack of resources, and now a
recent wave of

44:21.626 --> 44:23.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
teacher sick-outs.

44:23.528 --> 44:28.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of it is fueling a growing
anxiety that
the system could run out of
money in coming

44:28.299 --> 44:30.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

44:30.134 --> 44:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
April Brown has our report. It's
part of our
Making the Grade series, which
airs every

44:34.038 --> 44:35.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tuesday.

44:35.640 --> 44:38.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tonight's story is in
partnership with the
American Graduate Initiative.

44:38.376 --> 44:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The playground at
Detroit's Spain
Elementary and Middle School sat
empty for

44:43.114 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks. No children were allowed
in because
of this.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKIA WILSON, Counselor, Spain
Elementary
and Middle School: We started to
call it a

44:47.985 --> 44:52.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steam geyser, because we really
don't know
what it is, if you notice that
there is steam

44:52.256 --> 44:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming out there. There is also
some liquid
that is spewing out from it. So
it's very

44:56.594 --> 45:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dangerous because it causes the
temperatures
on the playground to reach 110
degrees.

45:00.698 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Lakia Wilson is the
counselor
at Spain, a school with a
century-long legacy

45:05.303 --> 45:10.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this Detroit neighborhood.
But for the
last two years, she says, steam
and water,

45:10.107 --> 45:13.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reportedly from the sewer
system, have been
seeping out of the concrete in
the parking

45:13.678 --> 45:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot and shooting out of this
pipe a few feet
away.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is your only playground?

45:18.950 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKIA WILSON: This is our own
only playground.
We have lost our gym, and we
have no playground

45:21.786 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: What do your kids
do for exercise
now?

45:24.855 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKIA WILSON: Our children are
limited to
walking the hallway. They have
become like

45:27.391 --> 45:29.226 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mall walkers.

45:29.327 --> 45:33.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: The gym she
referred to is now
locked. But before that
happened, a few cameras

45:33.297 --> 45:34.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
captured what is there.

45:34.799 --> 45:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How would you describe what we
see inside?

45:36.601 --> 45:44.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKIA WILSON: A scary movie. The
floor has
been removed, the parquet. And
now what you

45:45.042 --> 45:51.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
see is just a layer of
blackness. We have
been told that it was black
mold. In fact,

45:51.749 --> 45:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the city inspector said that it
was mold.

45:53.851 --> 45:58.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Teachers and staff
say they have
had building issues for years,
including mold,

45:58.255 --> 46:03.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
water damage, and broken
windows, some of
which city inspectors recently
cited as code

46:03.327 --> 46:05.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violations.

46:05.262 --> 46:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
India Brimberry, the school's
student health
aide, is among those concerned
these problems

46:08.833 --> 46:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are affecting the health of
those who work
and study here.

46:11.502 --> 46:14.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
INDIA BRIMBERRY, Spain
Elementary and Middle
School: I see a lot of
nosebleeds, a lot of

46:14.639 --> 46:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vomiting and stomach aches, a
lot of headaches
every day.

46:18.876 --> 46:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The conditions at
Spain, along
with structural and maintenance
problems at

46:23.681 --> 46:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other schools in the Detroit
Public School
District, came to light last
month, after

46:28.152 --> 46:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 80 were closed because
of the most
recent in a series of teacher
sick-outs over

46:32.723 --> 46:34.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
working conditions.

46:34.592 --> 46:38.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Soon afterward, the mayor
ordered nearly all
the city's schools be inspected.

46:38.629 --> 46:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one of the first schools
city inspectors
came to. Cody houses three
separate high schools,

46:43.701 --> 46:49.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and here the inspectors found 30
violations,
including mold, mildew and
evidence of rodents

46:49.306 --> 46:51.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and insects.

46:51.275 --> 46:54.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Detroit Institute of
Technology, a college
prep school located at Cody, is
where Christal

46:55.046 --> 47:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bonner teaches. She was among a
group of teachers,
parents and students who wanted
to share their

47:00.184 --> 47:07.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many experiences with issues
including large
class sizes and few resources in
a district

47:07.658 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that may soon run out of money.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTAL BONNER, Teacher,
Detroit Institute
of Technology: How can you call
yourself Detroit

47:11.962 --> 47:17.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Institute of Technology when
your technology
is nonexistent or very low? We
just have some

47:17.702 --> 47:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outdated regular desktop dells.
And we have
some old, outdated netbooks, and
in a couple

47:26.544 --> 47:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of rooms, you might have a smart
board. That's
it.

47:30.514 --> 47:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Eighteen-year-old
Lucas Beal
is a senior at Communication and
Media Arts

47:34.585 --> 47:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
High School a few miles away.

47:36.487 --> 47:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCAS BEAL, Student: In my math
class, there
are not enough textbooks. And
some of the

47:41.325 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pages are missing, so we have to
try to scramble
around and find the books with
that page,

47:47.164 --> 47:50.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to take a picture of the
problems we have
to do.

47:50.901 --> 47:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: At yet another high
school, Cass
Technical, senior Ashley Carson
is among a

47:55.473 --> 48:00.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of students there who
organized a walkout
both to support teachers and
protest the poor

48:00.611 --> 48:02.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conditions.

48:02.613 --> 48:06.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says that, even though the
physical conditions
at Cass Tech aren't as bad as
some others,

48:06.183 --> 48:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having so few resources is
demoralizing.

48:08.185 --> 48:12.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHLEY CARSON, Student: It's
kind of like
you feel like you're the --
like, the bottom

48:12.556 --> 48:18.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the barrel. You feel like
we're not worth
anything. We may know
differently, but what

48:18.662 --> 48:21.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're showing us is not that
we're worth
something.

48:21.766 --> 48:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Arlyssa Heard
pulled her son
out of a Detroit public school,
but is still

48:25.970 --> 48:27.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
concerned about what's
happening.

48:27.738 --> 48:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARLYSSA HEARD, Parent: How long
can you go
year after year with not getting
what you

48:32.810 --> 48:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need, without not having an
assistant in the
classroom, overcrowded classes,
not enough

48:38.349 --> 48:40.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
supplies, no prep time?

48:40.151 --> 48:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I would love to ask the
teacher in
the room, how do you keep going
in DPS?

48:44.889 --> 48:53.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTAL BONNER: Well, good
question. I guess
I keep going because the
students say, Ms.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bonner, are you coming back next
year?

48:55.933 --> 49:00.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Bonner has stayed
in the classroom,
but many other teachers have
quit. And after

49:00.704 --> 49:05.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
January's large-scale teacher
sick-out by
many who remained, the district
sued to stop

49:05.709 --> 49:08.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
similar protests in the future.

49:08.112 --> 49:09.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The district's head of

MICHELLE ZDRODOWSKI,
Communications Director,
Detroit Public Schools: We
understand the

49:11.882 --> 49:17.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teachers' frustration. We're all
frustrated.
We feel the same things that
teachers feel.

49:17.621 --> 49:22.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, ultimately, the important
thing is that
teachers are in the classroom
teaching. When

49:22.526 --> 49:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you close 88 schools on one day,
that doesn't
help kids.

49:26.497 --> 49:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Educators have been
snubbed.

49:28.666 --> 49:33.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The teachers union
next announced
it was filing suit against the
district, alleging

49:33.704 --> 49:38.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is not providing a minimally
adequate education
or properly maintaining the
schools.

49:38.509 --> 49:42.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ivy Bailey is the interim
president of the
Detroit Federation of Teachers:

49:42.346 --> 49:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVY BAILEY, Interim President,
Detroit Federation
of Teachers: You shouldn't have
to worry about,

49:44.148 --> 49:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you're going to come to
school, if water
is going to be dripping on your
head. You

49:46.717 --> 49:50.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't have to worry about if
you're breathing
in mold spores. You shouldn't
have to worry

49:50.588 --> 49:53.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about if there's going to be a
teacher sitting
in front of you when you get to
school.

49:54.024 --> 49:57.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: But district
officials say they
have been trying their best to
solve the problems.

49:57.895 --> 50:01.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE ZDRODOWSKI: When there
are life and
safety issues, we have done our
best to address

50:01.665 --> 50:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those as quickly as possible.
Bigger picture
issues like roofs that need --
complete roofs

50:05.903 --> 50:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that need replacing, we just
don't have the
funds for right now.

50:08.906 --> 50:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The poor conditions
have contributed
to educational achievement which
the mayor

50:13.110 --> 50:17.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
described last week as the
worst-performing
of any large city in America.

50:17.681 --> 50:21.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The district's financial
situation has been
declining for more than a
decade, along with

50:22.052 --> 50:29.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its enrollment, which plummeted
from more
than 140,000 in 2005 to about
47,000 a decade

50:29.526 --> 50:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later. At the same time, revenue
has dropped
from roughly $1.4 billion to
less than $800

50:36.133 --> 50:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million. And now expenditures
exceed revenue.

50:39.470 --> 50:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The district is now on the brink
of insolvency,
with more than $500 million of
debt. Emergency

50:44.942 --> 50:48.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
managers effectively took
control away from
the local school board in 2009.

50:48.512 --> 50:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), Michigan:
I think it's
critically important we improve
education

50:53.017 --> 50:54.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Detroit.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Michigan Governor
Rick Snyder
appointed the most recent,
Darnell Earley,

50:57.321 --> 51:00.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a year ago to improve the
district's financial
footing.

51:00.257 --> 51:06.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Earley has recently been
under fire for
his tenure as the emergency
manager in Flint,

51:06.297 --> 51:10.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan, when the city switched
its water
supply in a cost-cutting
measure, which resulted

51:10.434 --> 51:13.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in lead contamination and a
public health
crisis.

51:13.470 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earley resigned last week, but
is still in
his post until the end of
February.

51:17.574 --> 51:19.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
May I ask why Mr. Earley is not
available?

51:19.910 --> 51:22.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE ZDRODOWSKI: He's doing
the work of
the district.

51:22.579 --> 51:25.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Detroit Public
Schools head of
communications Michelle
Zdrodowski:

51:25.783 --> 51:29.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE ZDRODOWSKI: Well, as an
emergency
manager, he was responsible for
coming in

51:29.586 --> 51:36.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and addressing the financial
emergency. If
you look at our audit report
from fiscal year

51:36.160 --> 51:42.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
'15, it shows that, were it not
for the $515
million in long-term debt, we
would have had

51:42.132 --> 51:43.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a $13 million surplus.

51:44.068 --> 51:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But Earley has
acknowledged the
district will run out of cash in
April. Governor

51:48.439 --> 51:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Snyder says he plans to appoint
a transitional
leader for Detroit Public
Schools before the

51:53.077 --> 51:54.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
end of the month.

51:54.945 --> 51:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pending legislation could take
care of the
$515 million debt and offer
millions more

51:59.817 --> 52:04.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for restructuring, but there are
also concerns
the district could file for
bankruptcy instead.

52:04.888 --> 52:08.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCAS BEAL: You could suspend
me, but either
way, though, I still walked out.
You still

52:08.325 --> 52:10.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heard me.

52:10.327 --> 52:14.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Lucas Beal hopes
the situation
is addressed in time to benefit
younger students,

52:14.798 --> 52:17.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because he doesn't expect it
will be in time
to help him.

52:17.701 --> 52:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCAS BEAL: I'm currently a
senior, so I'm
about to go off. And I might
know half of

52:26.043 --> 52:28.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the stuff that I need, and I
might not because
of the lack of resources.

52:29.013 --> 52:38.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm April
Brown in Detroit.

52:38.288 --> 52:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Updating the
day's top stories:
The presidential hopefuls are
waiting for

52:48.632 --> 52:53.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the results from the year's
first primary.
Polls close in New Hampshire at
8:00 p.m.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Eastern.

52:55.706 --> 53:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this evening, the U.S.
Supreme Court has
blocked President Obama's plan
to curb carbon

53:00.477 --> 53:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dioxide emissions from power
plants until
legal challenges are resolved;
27 states and

53:07.351 --> 53:10.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
industry groups want the
regulation struck
down.

53:10.320 --> 53:16.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Later tonight, on
most PBS stations,
don't miss "The Fantasy Sports
Gamble." "Frontline"

53:16.560 --> 53:21.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teams up with The New York Times
to investigate
the phenomenon of online fantasy
sports sites,

53:21.965 --> 53:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exploring, among other things,
whether playing
constitutes gambling.

53:26.270 --> 53:30.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour" online:
There's a reason
the newest generation of
Democratic voters

53:30.274 --> 53:35.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't connecting with Hillary
Clinton the
same way older Democrats have,
and it's not

53:35.245 --> 53:39.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just Bernie Sanders. We talked
to younger
voters in New Hampshire to find
out how they

53:40.084 --> 53:43.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
view the former secretary of
state. That's
on our home page.
