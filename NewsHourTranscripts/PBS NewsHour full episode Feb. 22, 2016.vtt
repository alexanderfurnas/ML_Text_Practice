GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Republicans
rally in Nevada for tomorrow's
caucus after

00:11.845 --> 00:16.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump's big South
Carolina win this
weekend, while Democrats take on
the Palmetto

00:17.017 --> 00:18.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
State.

00:19.019 --> 00:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead: A
temporary cease-fire
is reached for war-torn Syria
one day after

00:23.957 --> 00:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deadliest attack yet by ISIS
kills at
least 130 people.

00:28.762 --> 00:34.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then: An empty chair
sits among
the Supreme Court justices, as
they hear cases

00:34.835 --> 00:38.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the first time without the
late Justice
Antonin Scalia.

00:38.572 --> 00:43.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why
scientists are turning
to elephants for hope in cancer
research.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN, Huntsman
Cancer Institute:
It's as if these elephant cells
have said,

00:47.047 --> 00:52.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, it's much safer, much
better strategy
to just kill the cell and start
over. If we

00:52.886 --> 00:58.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do that, there's no way that
that cell can
go on to become cancer, and that
was an aha

00:58.492 --> 00:59.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moment for us in the lab.

00:59.993 --> 01:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.302 --> 01:11.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.305 --> 01:20.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Confirmation
today that the
U.S. and Russia have agreed on
at least a

01:20.347 --> 01:22.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pause in the Syrian civil war.

01:23.016 --> 01:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The formal announcement came
from Washington
and Moscow, but it left unclear
just how extensive

01:28.956 --> 01:35.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the cease-fire might be.
Meanwhile, Syria's
President Bashar al-Assad called
a parliamentary

01:35.295 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election for April 13. We will
have a full
report later in the program.

01:39.933 --> 01:44.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: Authorities
in Michigan say the man accused
in Kalamazoo,

01:44.805 --> 01:50.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the killings, has admitted he
did it. Jason
Dalton faced a judge via video
link from jail

01:50.911 --> 01:56.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. He was denied bail, and
didn't enter
a plea. Police say Dalton killed
six people

01:56.149 --> 02:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at random in three separate
locations Saturday
night around Kalamazoo.

02:01.421 --> 02:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The local prosecutor said today
he's acknowledged
his role, but given no reason.

02:05.525 --> 02:10.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF GETTING, Kalamazoo County
Prosecutor:
I have described this previously
as intentional,

02:10.664 --> 02:20.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as deliberate, as cold. This
wasn't a -- just
a momentary lapse. This wasn't
just a crime.

02:20.674 --> 02:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was nothing that provoked
this. There
is videotapes of these
incidences. He walked

02:25.746 --> 02:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up on these people and he shot
them.

02:27.814 --> 02:32.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Dalton is a driver
for the ride-sharing
service Uber. Investigators are
checking reports

02:33.086 --> 02:35.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he picked up passengers
between the attacks.

02:35.489 --> 02:40.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama
administration today
defended its handling of a North
Korean call

02:40.961 --> 02:45.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for direct talks between the two
countries.
The Wall Street Journal had
reported that

02:45.799 --> 02:52.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. officials agreed to talks,
without first
demanding the North give up its
nuclear program.

02:52.205 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House says it insisted
the nuclear
issue be part of any talks, and
says that's

02:57.611 --> 03:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consistent with longstanding
U.S. policy.
The North refused, and, days
later, carried

03:03.316 --> 03:05.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out a nuclear test.

03:05.285 --> 03:10.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Days of violent
protests in Northern
India may finally be coming to
an end. The

03:10.357 --> 03:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government agreed on concessions
late today.

03:12.959 --> 03:18.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unrest in Haryana state has
killed at
least 19 people and cut off
water to New Delhi,

03:18.532 --> 03:21.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as Jonathan Miller of
Independent Television
News reports.

03:22.002 --> 03:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: The angry
farmers of Haryana
have taken the bull by the
horns.

03:28.442 --> 03:32.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Feeling hard done by, thousands
have gone
on the rampage to protest
against a lack of

03:33.013 --> 03:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prospects in a fragile new world
where many
fall through the cracks.
Paramilitary forces

03:39.853 --> 03:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were ordered to shoot looters
and rioters
on sight, and they did.

03:45.325 --> 03:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, more than 10 million
people in Delhi
have no water to drink or to
wash in because

03:50.997 --> 03:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the protesters sabotaged the
Munak canal,
which provides the capital with
most of its

03:56.636 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water supply. The protesters
belong to the
Jat farming caste, of whom there
are 80 million

04:05.045 --> 04:12.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
across North India, eight
million in Haryana,
the state northwest of Delhi.

04:12.953 --> 04:19.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want more government jobs
and places
in state education institutions,
half of which

04:19.459 --> 04:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are ring-fenced for what the
Indian government
calls other backward classes,
traditionally

04:25.398 --> 04:29.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far more disadvantaged than
upper-caste Jats.

04:29.102 --> 04:35.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
generation of
the Jat community is in danger
of losing out.

04:35.175 --> 04:38.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are demanding hope for the
younger generation.
The government should
immediately make us

04:38.979 --> 04:41.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of the quota system.

04:41.348 --> 04:47.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: After days of
negotiations,
Jat community leaders have, it
seems, a forced

04:47.287 --> 04:55.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capitulation. The Haryana state
minister promised
to table legislation to include
Jats in the

04:55.729 --> 04:58.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
caste quota system.

04:58.965 --> 05:06.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the federal interior
minister has ordered
that a high-level committee be
set up to address

05:06.239 --> 05:07.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Jats' grievances.

05:08.041 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The water service is
now expected
to resume tomorrow. But it could
take days

05:12.312 --> 05:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to remove vehicles left blocking
highways
and to restore rail service.

05:16.983 --> 05:22.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Uganda,
international observers
were openly critical after
officials announced

05:22.422 --> 05:28.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 30-year-long president has
been reelected.
They said Yoweri Museveni took
more than 60

05:28.662 --> 05:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of vote. But European
monitors said
he won through intimidation. The
opposition

05:33.967 --> 05:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charged fraud. And, today,
police hustled
the main challenger into a van
and took him

05:39.873 --> 05:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away. He's been arrested four
times in eight
days.

05:42.943 --> 05:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fiji faced a huge
cleanup today
after Tropical Cyclone Winston
blasted the

05:48.348 --> 05:53.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pacific Island nation over the
weekend. The
storm struck with winds of up to
200 miles

05:53.119 --> 05:57.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an hour late Saturday. At least
21 people
were killed. Today, people
picked through

05:57.991 --> 06:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's left of ruined villages,
and aid agencies
warned of a possible health
crisis.

06:03.396 --> 06:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're worried about low-lying
areas where
crops are destroyed and water
supplies cut

06:08.134 --> 06:09.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
off.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, U.S.
Senator Claire McCaskill has
announced that

06:12.539 --> 06:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she has breast cancer and will
take a three-week
leave of absence. The Missouri
Democrat says

06:17.744 --> 06:22.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a blog post that she will be
taking treatments
in Saint Louis. She says --
quote -- "It's

06:22.449 --> 06:25.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a little scary," but her
prognosis is good.

06:25.418 --> 06:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Wall Street
started the week
on a high note, helped by an
upturn in oil

06:30.023 --> 06:37.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prices. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained
228 points to close at 16620.
The Nasdaq rose

06:37.464 --> 06:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
66 points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
27.

06:40.500 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio fight
to become Donald

06:46.806 --> 06:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's biggest threat; another
fragile deal
for a cease-fire in Syria; the
Supreme Court's

06:53.413 --> 07:00.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first session without Justice
Scalia; and
much more.

07:00.520 --> 07:11.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: With one more
contest down and
one less opponent to battle, the
Republican

07:11.598 --> 07:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential candidates spent
the day scrambling
for the next round of votes.
Meanwhile, Hillary

07:16.536 --> 07:21.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton expanded her lead over
Democrat Bernie
Sanders. With Jeb Bush now out
of the race,

07:21.875 --> 07:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Trump with another solid
victory in hand,
Republicans moved to
consolidate.

07:26.479 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We won with everything. We won
with women.

07:34.554 --> 07:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I love the women. We won with
women.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:42.262 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: we won with men. I
would rather
win with women, to be honest. We
won with

07:45.231 --> 07:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything, tall people, short
people, fat
people, skinny people, just won.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
The field is narrower now, but
you still have

07:52.272 --> 07:55.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names to pick from, and maybe
you like a couple
of people in this race and you
are trying

07:55.809 --> 07:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to decide between us. So I'm not
here to bad-mouth
anybody else.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Coming out of New Hampshire for
the first

08:01.481 --> 08:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, my voice is being heard.
And, you know,
for that whole long period of
time, we couldn't

08:09.422 --> 08:15.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get anybody in the press to pay
attention.
And now they're finally
beginning to hear.

08:15.395 --> 08:21.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now this morning, here in
Virginia, we
have about 1,000 people that
have come to

08:21.201 --> 08:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hear a voice of experience,
accomplishment.

08:23.603 --> 08:29.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And then today Rubio
locked horns
with Ted Cruz after Cruz's
communications

08:29.275 --> 08:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director erroneously accused
Rubio of criticizing
the Bible. The Cruz aide, Rick
Tyler, was

08:34.681 --> 08:36.082 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fired.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the fight for money, for
endorsements
and for credibility is on.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we turn to Politics Monday
with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

08:44.124 --> 08:44.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As I say every week, where to
begin?

08:47.660 --> 08:51.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's talk about the
Republicans, Amy, especially
what looks like a three-man
race.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This Saturday definitely
consolidated the
field in a way that we were
expecting to see

08:59.072 --> 09:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it happen after New Hampshire.
It didn't.
But with Jeb Bush dropping out
and Carson

09:05.612 --> 09:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not getting much vote, John
Kasich is still
in the race. As he noted, he
thinks he is

09:09.215 --> 09:11.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be able to pick up some
momentum
when we get out to March 1.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, of course, when
he gets heard,
sometimes, it's for his stumbles
as much as

09:15.188 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for anything else.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Sometimes, it's for
his stumbles.
And the reality is, there is
just not a lot

09:18.291 --> 09:20.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of support there for John
Kasich.

09:20.126 --> 09:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really is Marco Rubio now who
is getting
the so-called establishment lane
to himself.

09:25.465 --> 09:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every minute, it seems, we're
getting another
update of another senator,
another governor,

09:29.569 --> 09:34.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another member of Congress
endorsing Marco
Rubio. The real question now is,
is it too

09:34.107 --> 09:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late? Did they wait too late to
consolidate
to stop Donald Trump?

09:38.344 --> 09:42.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I did -- my e-mail
box, like yours,
has been full of endorsements
all day coming

09:42.215 --> 09:48.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from establishment, senators,
members of Congress
for Marco Rubio, but I wonder
whether the

09:48.488 --> 09:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishment lane exists in an
election year
when Donald Trump does so well.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
and we keep wondering whether
the establishment

09:55.862 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lane really exists.

09:57.797 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that if it were
anyone else at
the top of this field who had
won New Hampshire

10:03.436 --> 10:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and won South Carolina, we
wouldn't even be
having a discussion about who's
going to overtake

10:08.341 --> 10:08.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: But it's Donald
Trump, and so
the discussion continues,
because there are

10:13.079 --> 10:17.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of people in the
Republican Party and
in the media and everywhere else
who are like,

10:17.750 --> 10:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really? Really, this is going to
happen?

10:19.786 --> 10:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is, at the moment, very
much the front-runner.
He's running a very
unconventional campaign.

10:25.825 --> 10:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're now getting into a part of
the race
where it becomes more of a
national campaign

10:30.730 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
than a state-by-state,
hand-by-hand kind of
race, and he's been running that
kind of campaign

10:36.135 --> 10:37.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all along.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Though I would
argue, if it were
any other candidate who had
negatives as high

10:41.107 --> 10:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Donald Trump does, which
right now among
all voters, his very negatives
are at 50 percent,

10:46.679 --> 10:50.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he is the most polarizing
candidate in the
Republican field now that Jeb
Bush is gone.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was the second most
polarizing, most polarizing
in the field.

10:54.187 --> 10:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is still a lot of angst
among Republicans
about having him at the top.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But think about this
for a moment.
Today's little dust-up between
Ted Cruz and

11:01.961 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio, who did that help
in the end?
It helps Donald Trump, right?

11:05.765 --> 11:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes. Absolutely.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Because Donald Trump
gets to stand
by while they fight each other.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And he tweeted
about it gleefully.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, thank you for
doing that.

11:12.672 --> 11:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, when you look at the
amount of money
that is being spent on attack
ads, the lion's

11:17.277 --> 11:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
share of it has gone actually to
attack Marco
Rubio. Very little money has
been spent going

11:22.782 --> 11:27.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after Donald Trump, at least in
the paid media.
And certainly we don't see it
all that much

11:27.487 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even on the debate stage. We see
a little
skirmish, but there's not been a
concerted

11:32.559 --> 11:33.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effort.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And if there were?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And that's what a
lot of people
are wondering.

11:36.729 --> 11:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here's what I -- I had to
write this down,
but I think there are three R's
right now

11:41.034 --> 11:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on with the Republicans
writ large,
resignation, reluctance,
rationalization.

11:47.106 --> 11:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of that is, they're sort of
in some ways
resigned to, well, maybe Trump
can win because

11:51.578 --> 11:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it seems like we can't figure
out a way to
beat him, a reluctance to really
challenge

11:55.348 --> 12:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, as I said, not a lot of
money been spent
going after him, especially by
outside groups,

12:01.654 --> 12:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and rationalization, this idea
that, well,
maybe Trump won't be that bad,
maybe he could

12:05.224 --> 12:07.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a general election candidate.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After all, Hillary Clinton is
really vulnerable.
After all, she could be
indicted. And, look,

12:11.631 --> 12:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's bringing out all these new
voters. But
they're forgetting that a
general election

12:16.102 --> 12:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks a whole lot different than
a primary.

12:18.104 --> 12:22.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A word about Jeb
Bush. What happened?
When we sat here a year ago, we
were talking

12:22.842 --> 12:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how he was clearly ahead.
He raised
tons of money, and yet he's
completely out

12:27.614 --> 12:29.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the race.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And I think he
said it best,
which is that he heard the
voters,and the

12:32.719 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters told him that they just
didn't -- they
didn't want what he was selling.

12:37.423 --> 12:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what he was selling
is a brand
of establishment politics. He is
the insider's

12:44.998 --> 12:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insider. He had all of that
money, and voters
are attracted to a guy who says
he can't be

12:50.670 --> 12:52.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bought.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, speaking of
someone who
says he can't be bought, let's
talk about

12:54.507 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, who didn't have
a good weekend,
and now is trying to come up
with a strategy

12:58.211 --> 13:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which looks like it's more about
delegate-picking
than anything else.

13:01.948 --> 13:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The challenge for
Bernie Sanders
is that the delegate system that
the Democrats

13:07.954 --> 13:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have is actually incredibly
helpful for underdogs,
and it makes it -- it's supposed
to make it

13:13.559 --> 13:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harder for somebody like Hillary
Clinton,
an establishment candidate, to
build up a

13:17.296 --> 13:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big lead, because delegates are
awarded proportionately.
You can win a state by a million
votes.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You still only get a certain
number of delegates.
The challenge for Bernie Sanders
right now

13:26.339 --> 13:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that he hasn't done well
enough in the
states he should be doing well
in, that he's

13:31.177 --> 13:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not building a delegate lead.
And so the math
is going to start to get really
difficult

13:37.016 --> 13:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him, because, if he keeps
losing states
that look like Nevada, South
Carolina, a lot

13:41.654 --> 13:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these Southern states, he
can't just make
it up by running the table in
some other states.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in fact, when
he talks about
running the table in states like
Minnesota,

13:50.463 --> 13:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Colorado, Massachusetts,
Vermont, he doesn't
even say -- he says that I have
a shot there.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
Hillary Clinton,
though. She's already
leapfrogged ahead to

13:57.804 --> 14:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas, even though Saturday -- I
mean, even
though this week is South
Carolina.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. Yes.

14:04.143 --> 14:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she flew directly from
Nevada to Texas.
Texas is the biggest delegate
prize on Super

14:08.648 --> 14:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuesday, and she's also playing
a delegate
game and she wants to maximize
the delegates

14:14.754 --> 14:20.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where she can get them in places
like Texas.
She expects to do very well in
South Carolina.

14:20.193 --> 14:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a strong lead among
African-Americans,
and the entrance polls in Nevada
are very

14:28.701 --> 14:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good news for her on that front,
because she
absolutely dominated among
African-Americans.

14:34.006 --> 14:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story isn't quite as clear
with Latino
voters. It seems as though she
and Bernie

14:37.910 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sanders split Latino voters.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But I do remember
that the Clintons
have spent a lot of time. In
fact, Bill Clinton

14:42.882 --> 14:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has spent a lot of time on the
ground in Texas
over the years, and so the
groundwork has

14:46.486 --> 14:47.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been laid there.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does Bernie Sanders
-- did he
ever get the young voter turnout
that he was

14:51.424 --> 14:52.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
counting on?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's the big
issue here.

14:54.527 --> 15:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders talks about
building a revolution.
And the revolution is smaller
than the revolution

15:00.700 --> 15:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Barack Obama built. The
voter turnout
in Iowa and New Hampshire and
now in Nevada

15:07.774 --> 15:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not nearly as high as it was
in 2008. But,
in 2008, you had Barack Obama
vs. Hillary

15:14.614 --> 15:18.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton. I mean, it's historic.
It's a fight
for the ages.

15:18.584 --> 15:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time around, Bernie Sanders
has huge
enthusiasm, but Republicans are
turning out

15:24.524 --> 15:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more voters than Democrats. And
that has to
be a worry for Democrats heading
into the

15:28.227 --> 15:29.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
general election.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: In fact, if you even
dig further
into the turnout numbers, what
you see is

15:31.864 --> 15:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people who are under the
age of 30 are
a smaller percent than they were
in 2008,

15:37.570 --> 15:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and people who are over the age
of 65 are
a bigger percent than they were
in 2008.

15:42.542 --> 15:46.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She does much better with older
voters. He
does much better with younger
voters. So,

15:46.445 --> 15:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it becomes something of a wash.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You begin to see
their path.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amy Walter of Cook
Political Report,
Tamara Keith of NPR, thank you
all.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

15:57.890 --> 16:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

16:02.395 --> 16:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Syria's civil war
has ground
on for almost five years, but
this day saw

16:09.068 --> 16:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a diplomatic step that could
begin the process
of ending a conflict that's
killed 250,000

16:16.642 --> 16:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people and displaced millions
more.

16:19.245 --> 16:23.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

16:23.549 --> 16:28.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Syrian
government forces
and rebel groups battled
furiously through

16:28.454 --> 16:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the weekend. But some of the
shooting is supposed
to stop this Saturday. Official
word came

16:34.794 --> 16:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after President Obama spoke to
Russian President
Vladimir Putin by phone.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House spokesman Josh
Earnest:

16:41.601 --> 16:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
It will require all of the
parties who signed

16:45.037 --> 16:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
onto this document to follow
through on the
commitments that they have made.
The whole

16:51.577 --> 16:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world can see in writing what
everyone has
committed to, and it's time for
the signatories

16:58.551 --> 17:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to step up and for the bloodshed
to come to
an end.

17:02.922 --> 17:08.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: And from
Moscow, Putin called
it a real chance to stop the
violence.

17:08.494 --> 17:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
had initially
announced a provisional
agreement yesterday,

17:13.432 --> 17:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after long-distance discussions
with Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
The plan does

17:18.638 --> 17:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allow for continuing U.S. and
Russian airstrikes
against the Islamic State group,
Jabhat al-Nusra,

17:24.977 --> 17:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and -- quote -- "other terrorist
organizations
designated by the U.N. Security
Council."

17:29.749 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That last phrase will be key,
since the Russians
regard nearly all groups
fighting the Syrian

17:35.655 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government as terrorists. It's
also unclear
if the various fighting factions
will actually

17:41.894 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go along with the cease-fire.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still, U.N. officials expressed
cautious optimism.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANE DUJARRIC, Spokesman,
Office of the
U.N. Secretary-General: It is a
long-awaited

17:48.467 --> 17:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signal of hope to the Syrian
people that after
five years of conflict, there
may be an end

17:54.206 --> 17:59.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to their suffering in sight.
Much work now
lies ahead to ensure the
implementation.

17:59.111 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There's also
hope that a
cease-fire will allow for the
quick relaunch

18:02.949 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of peace talks between the
government and
opposition groups. But, for now,
there is

18:07.853 --> 18:13.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
no respite. Islamic State
bombings in Homs
and a Damascus suburb yesterday
killed 130

18:13.659 --> 18:14.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret
Warner joins me
now.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Margaret, what did it take
to get this
deal?

18:19.799 --> 18:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, U.S.
officials believe
it took two things, one, that
Vladimir Putin

18:24.003 --> 18:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had decided he got most of what
he wanted
on the ground. He shored up
Assad enough.

18:28.607 --> 18:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Assad military can handle
things. They
have taken back some territory
from both ISIS

18:35.081 --> 18:39.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and from the moderate
opposition, and that
he doesn't want to get sucked
into the quagmire.

18:39.385 --> 18:44.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The second thing that was
epitomized in the
phone call today is Putin wanted
to be seen

18:44.623 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here as a partner to the United
States in
resolving the conflict in Syria.
And he wasn't

18:50.262 --> 18:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even a player last September
before he sent
in troops. So it's not bad work
in five months

18:56.068 --> 19:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he is now co-chairing this
group with
President Obama.

19:01.240 --> 19:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How confident,
having said
that, is the United States that
this is actually

19:05.511 --> 19:07.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to work?

19:07.380 --> 19:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, Judy, I
have to say
one official said to me today no
one's doing

19:10.383 --> 19:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high-fives around here. And
another one said,
after Ukraine, we don't
necessarily believe

19:14.820 --> 19:16.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anything.

19:16.789 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the key concession, I'm
told, that Putin
has made is that he will no
longer take Assad's

19:22.828 --> 19:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretext for bombing the moderate
opposition.
As we said in the setup, what he
has been

19:27.700 --> 19:32.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing is accepting Assad's
definition of terrorists,
and so even the moderate
opposition supported

19:33.039 --> 19:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the U.S. was being pounded by
Russian military,
and that if you look at the
language of the

19:38.611 --> 19:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
document, it now says you can
pound away at
ISIS, the al-Nusra Front or
other groups designated

19:45.251 --> 19:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorists by the U.N., and that
actually
means something.

19:49.188 --> 19:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Margaret,
why has this
been so hard to get?

19:53.559 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Oh.

19:55.394 --> 19:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Judy, the big problem is,
you know,
there are so many players, not
only on the

19:59.565 --> 20:06.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ground in Syria, but that
everyone has a different
mentor, a different benefactor,
all with different

20:06.439 --> 20:11.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aims. So, for the U.S., number
one is getting
rid of ISIS. For the Russians,
number one

20:11.243 --> 20:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was getting -- shoring up their
client state
Syria.

20:15.915 --> 20:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all the Gulf states, with
the Saudis in
the lead, number one was getting
rid of Assad.

20:21.954 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the Turks, number one
was undercutting
the Turkish Kurdish fighters
whom they see

20:29.995 --> 20:35.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as cousins to their own
terrorist Kurds, the
PKK. And so when you have a
group like that,

20:35.634 --> 20:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have always known that
they're never
going to get the parties on the
ground to

20:38.871 --> 20:40.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agree to this.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had to come from the big
boys, the 17-member
group. But when they couldn't
agree on what

20:44.343 --> 20:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the objective was, that's why
it's been so
very difficult.

20:47.179 --> 20:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you point
out, so many
different interests from so many
different

20:51.717 --> 20:53.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
directions.

20:53.552 --> 20:58.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, there's been just
steady criticism
that the administration hasn't
done enough,

20:58.290 --> 21:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that so many people have been
killed, millions
displaced from Syria. How does
the administration

21:03.496 --> 21:05.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
handle that?

21:05.364 --> 21:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, you're
right, Judy,
not only tremendous criticism,
but that the

21:07.867 --> 21:11.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States was being played
by the Russians,
that the Russians got themselves
in there

21:11.437 --> 21:18.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promising help to defeat ISIS,
and instead
used it to pound away at Assad's
adversaries.

21:18.944 --> 21:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their answer -- well, Secretary
Kerry got
a little irritated this weekend
and said,

21:23.816 --> 21:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, I have not heard any
alternatives from
anyone else.

21:26.785 --> 21:32.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there are alternatives, but
we will leave
that aside. Their answer is we
believe the

21:33.025 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only way to defeat ISIS, which
is our number
one objective, is end the
conflict in Syria.

21:39.165 --> 21:45.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Number two, we work for a
president who is
not willing to put in any more
military muscle.

21:45.538 --> 21:50.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are now supporting the
moderate opposition
somewhat, but nothing serious,
no surface-to-air

21:50.543 --> 21:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missiles to shoot down planes,
nothing like
that.

21:53.312 --> 21:58.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so really talking is the
only -- getting
all the parties together and
trying to get

21:58.717 --> 22:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a political resolution was
the only way
to go. But a senior White House
official said

22:03.722 --> 22:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me last week, you know, if
this -- this
is really a turning point. If
this doesn't

22:07.593 --> 22:08.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
work, I don't know where we go.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will see
where it
develops.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: We will see if
it goes anywhere.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, if it does,
a huge development.

22:15.234 --> 22:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Huge, if it
does.

22:16.869 --> 22:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,
thank you.

22:24.610 --> 22:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us, coming
up on the
"NewsHour": what a British exit
from the E.U.

22:34.153 --> 22:40.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would mean for global stability;
why elephants
are largely immune to cancer;
and a poet's

22:40.526 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tribute to his father and his
photographs.

22:43.329 --> 22:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, the Supreme Court
returned to
the bench today, absent Justice
Antonin Scalia.

22:49.368 --> 22:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a tribute read from the
bench, Chief Justice
John Roberts noted that Scalia,
who passed

22:53.505 --> 22:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a way a little over a week ago,
authored 282
majority opinions for the court.

22:58.644 --> 23:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"He was also known, on occasion,
to dissent.
We remember his incisive
intellect, his agile

23:05.150 --> 23:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wit, and his captivating prose.
But we cannot
forget his irrepressible spirit.
He was our

23:10.623 --> 23:14.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man for all seasons, and we
shall miss him
beyond measure."

23:14.827 --> 23:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal"
was in the courtroom today, and
she joins

23:17.863 --> 23:19.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a somber mood in that
courtroom, in
that chamber.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
It was. It was, Gwen.

23:22.835 --> 23:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was subdued. And I think,
throughout the
court -- I can't speak for
everyone who works

23:28.407 --> 23:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the court -- but it was
somber, but
I think there also was a sense
of fatigue,

23:33.212 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it was a very emotional
week for everyone.
Relationships among the justices
are long

23:39.151 --> 23:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and good. And the relationships
between justices
and court employees are also
close.

23:46.325 --> 23:51.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you walk through the court
building after
hours, there is a sense of real
family. They

23:51.597 --> 23:56.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
consider it a family-type
institution. I thought
the chief justice hit the right
note inside

23:57.002 --> 24:03.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the courtroom. He was respectful
of Justice
Scalia's background, education,
family and

24:03.609 --> 24:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also had a few little light
notes in there.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That little comment
about the
dissents.

24:07.579 --> 24:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Occasionally in
dissent to remind
us of how he was on and off the
bench.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He also mentioned
that he only
argued one case before the court
and won it,

24:15.654 --> 24:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so he had a perfect record.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Exactly. Exactly.

24:18.957 --> 24:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- but it was very much
business as usual
when the court took up two cases
this morning.

24:24.163 --> 24:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were just, I think, as
many questions
from those justices who
typically question,

24:30.402 --> 24:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what was really missing was
kind of the
spark, the color that Justice
Scalia brought

24:35.708 --> 24:37.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his own questions.

24:37.609 --> 24:42.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, as the court
was having
their discussions about -- first
of all, explain

24:42.548 --> 24:43.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
briefly what those two cases
were.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Sure.

24:45.851 --> 24:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ironically, these cases seemed
tailor-made
for Justice Scalia. The first
one involved

24:49.088 --> 24:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interpreting a federal law that
mandates that
a preference be given to
veteran-owned small

24:55.728 --> 25:02.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
businesses by the Department of
Veterans Affairs
when it awards contracts. And so
the language

25:02.868 --> 25:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the statute, Justice Scalia
was a bear
about textualism. If the words
are clear,

25:08.741 --> 25:10.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that ends the discussion.

25:10.676 --> 25:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had a feeling almost that
Justice Kagan
was channeling her inner Scalia
during the

25:14.913 --> 25:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arguments as she focused on the
words of the
statute and pressed the
government's lawyer,

25:21.754 --> 25:25.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't you following it? It
seems pretty clear
to me that the statute, when it
uses the word

25:26.024 --> 25:27.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shall means shall.

25:27.926 --> 25:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second case was a Fourth
Amendment case.
And he had written often in
Fourth Amendment

25:31.997 --> 25:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases, very protective of the
privacy of individuals
in their person, their homes and
their documents.

25:39.037 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this case involved an
illegal stop of
someone by a police officer who
then did an

25:46.044 --> 25:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrest warrant check, found
there was an arrest
warrant, arrested the person he
stopped, and

25:51.650 --> 25:53.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
searched him.

25:53.419 --> 25:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question was whether the
evidence
that he found of drugs could be
suppressed

25:58.190 --> 26:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the initial stop was
illegal, there
was no reasonable suspicion. So,
both cases

26:04.396 --> 26:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really played, I think, to
Justice Scalia's
interests.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Yes. So, while the
justices were
going about business of court,
right across

26:09.868 --> 26:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the street, in Congress, they
were beginning
what you have lived through
before and covered

26:14.740 --> 26:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before, which is the motions you
go through
to actually fill that vacancy.

26:17.843 --> 26:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw members of the Senate
go to the
floor and praise Justice Scalia,
but also

26:21.814 --> 26:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
begin to lay the groundwork for
the drama
that is going to begin.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

26:26.485 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does any of that
seep into the
court building itself, any of
that political

26:29.121 --> 26:29.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drama?

26:29.788 --> 26:31.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Not really.

26:31.623 --> 26:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the justices and the
employees are
very aware of what's going on. I
think even

26:36.562 --> 26:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of them have a feeling that
they would
like to see this get on, get
done with. But,

26:42.201 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no, they're really unaffected by
the politics.
The court does its work, and
today did its

26:48.707 --> 26:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work as it has always done,
whether it's with
eight -- nine justices, eight
justices, or

26:53.612 --> 26:57.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
seven justices, and will
continue to work
through the end of the term.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The White House put
out a photograph
this week of the president
walking down the

27:00.919 --> 27:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colonnade at the White House
carrying a great,
big briefcase folder, so clearly
to show that

27:04.990 --> 27:06.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
somebody is hard at work.

27:06.925 --> 27:11.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But both sides have done an
interesting thing
and over the years. And that is
to say, this

27:11.463 --> 27:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, whoever he is, if
it's an election
year, shouldn't have a say in
this. And today

27:16.168 --> 27:20.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emerged a video of Joe Biden,
who is now the
vice president, of course, at
the time the

27:20.472 --> 27:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Judiciary Committee
chairman, saying
the same thing in 1992.

27:23.976 --> 27:24.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:24.776 --> 27:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A little different.

27:26.512 --> 27:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: 1992. Yes, 1992,
there was no
vacancy. It was an election
year.

27:30.215 --> 27:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would imagine -- I'm not
in Vice President
Biden's head, but I imagine
there was a concern

27:36.588 --> 27:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there might be a vacancy.
It was June.
And in June, politicians' eyes
turn to the

27:43.061 --> 27:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court. They always
wonder if there's
going to be retirements,
resignations.

27:47.566 --> 27:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This, to me is typical partisan
back-and-forth
and is probably not all that
helpful. But

27:54.239 --> 27:59.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there have been many discussions
over the
years on how to improve the
confirmation process.

27:59.211 --> 28:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one that he was offering
in '92, no
election year confirmations.
There have been

28:04.483 --> 28:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others, you know, term limits,
and we're going
to continue to see this.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, there's one
more confirmation
battle for you to cover there,
Marcia.

28:10.556 --> 28:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: We will see, won't
we?

28:11.723 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:13.158 --> 28:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Marcia Coyle of
"National Law
Journal," thank you.

28:14.226 --> 28:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Gwen.

28:22.301 --> 28:34.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
Kingdom has been
a part of the European Union for
more than

28:34.112 --> 28:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40 years. But its place in that
postwar attempt
at European integration is now
in question,

28:40.852 --> 28:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and whether Britain will stay or
go is a hotly-contested
issue that will soon go before
British voters.

28:47.459 --> 28:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: I have
no other agenda than what is
best for our

28:51.663 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

28:53.532 --> 28:56.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a
high-stakes moment,
the British leader appealing to
the House

28:56.702 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Commons, and to the country
at large, not
to bolt from the European Union.

29:01.974 --> 29:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON: Our current trade
agreements
with 53 countries around the
world would lapse.

29:07.579 --> 29:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This cannot be described as
anything other
than risk, uncertainty, and a
leap in the

29:12.784 --> 29:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dark that could hurt working
people in our
country for years to come.

29:17.155 --> 29:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Cameron
said the deal
he struck with 27 other E.U.
nations on Friday

29:23.528 --> 29:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grants Britain special status.
It includes
measures to ensure Britain won't
be forced

29:29.668 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into becoming part of a European
super-state.
It also creates safeguards for
Britain's financial

29:36.041 --> 29:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
services and the pound currency.
And it grants
London the power to limit
welfare payments

29:42.781 --> 29:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to migrants from the rest of
Europe.

29:46.251 --> 29:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cameron is depending on that
deal to win over
doubters in his own Conservative
Party. But

29:52.057 --> 29:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the effort was dealt a major
blow yesterday
when London's popular mayor and
fellow Conservative

29:58.530 --> 30:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boris Johnson came out in favor
of leaving
the E.U., what's become known as
the Brexit.

30:04.670 --> 30:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, Mayor of London:
I will be
advocating vote leave or
whatever the team

30:09.741 --> 30:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is called. And I understand
there are many
of them. I think that is
basically -- because

30:14.880 --> 30:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want a better deal for the
people of this
country, to save them money and
to take back

30:22.187 --> 30:23.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

30:24.022 --> 30:28.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnson's
announcement could
increase the odds that Britons
will vote to

30:28.293 --> 30:35.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
leave the E.U. in a June
referendum. But opinions
were decidedly mixed on the
streets of London.

30:35.467 --> 30:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We'd be just better off
on our own.
I think, you know, we have been
an island

30:39.938 --> 30:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a long time, and I don't
think we need
to rely on other people.

30:42.274 --> 30:49.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Europe protects our
employment rights,
our human rights and maybe they
keep our government

30:49.614 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in control.

30:51.416 --> 30:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leaders of other
E.U. member
nations, including Italian Prime
Minister

30:55.754 --> 30:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matteo Renzi, also criticized a
possible exit.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTEO RENZI, Italian Prime
Minister (through
translator): The consequences
would be worse

31:02.761 --> 31:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for British citizens than for
European ones.
We hope this will not happen,
but were I to

31:07.399 --> 31:12.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
make a forecast, if Great
Britain leaves,
the main problem will be for the
U.K., its

31:12.504 --> 31:14.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
businesses and its citizens.

31:14.439 --> 31:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The uncertainty
over Britain's
future in the bloc has already
taken a toll.

31:20.545 --> 31:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The British pound's value fell
more than 2
percent today.

31:26.451 --> 31:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With me now to discuss the
political battle
of Britain's possible exit from
the European

31:30.956 --> 31:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union and its implications is
Steven Erlanger.
He's the London bureau chief for
The New York

31:37.429 --> 31:38.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Times.

31:38.463 --> 31:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Steve Erlanger, thank you for
joining us.

31:40.866 --> 31:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why, after decades of being part
of the E.U.,
are so many Britons looking to
leave it?

31:47.506 --> 31:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER, The New York
Times: Well,
we still don't know how many are
really looking

31:51.009 --> 31:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave it. Certainly, there's
a big portion
of the Conservative Party which
has wanted

31:56.047 --> 32:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to leave it probably ever since
Britain joined
it.

32:00.418 --> 32:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1975, 41 years ago, there was
a similar
referendum which passed by,
like, two-thirds

32:06.525 --> 32:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to one-third to join it. But
ever since Margaret
Thatcher demanded her money
back, John Major

32:13.565 --> 32:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had lots of trouble with the
Conservative
Party angry about Brussels,
angry about what

32:19.704 --> 32:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they perceived to be loss of
sovereignty.

32:22.340 --> 32:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to manage his own party,
David Cameron
thought he should promise them
this referendum,

32:28.847 --> 32:34.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this in-or-out referendum on
Brussels, if
he won power again. Well, lo and
behold, even

32:34.152 --> 32:40.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to his surprise, he won a
majority, so he
sort of caught himself and felt
that he had

32:40.725 --> 32:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make good on his promise and
hold this
in-or-out referendum.

32:44.663 --> 32:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what are the
main arguments
today for leaving the E.U.?

32:50.502 --> 32:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, some of
them are historical
and nostalgic. Britain is an
island that was

32:55.841 --> 33:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an empire. It's never been fully
European,
but it's too close to Europe to
escape it,

33:02.380 --> 33:11.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.
It was very much engaged in the
great European
wars, but it won them, and so it
has a different

33:11.323 --> 33:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense of its own sovereignty
than, let's say,
France or Germany, or Belgium,
which understand

33:17.429 --> 33:20.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that sovereignty can be
vulnerable.

33:20.332 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Britain isn't -- it's an
Anglo-Saxon country.
It has a different notion of
laws. It's not

33:28.940 --> 33:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Napoleonic code. So that's
one thing.
And the second thing is the
British sense

33:35.313 --> 33:40.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of sovereignty. They feel
Parliament really
must be sovereign, and the
people who want

33:40.652 --> 33:47.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to leave feel Brussels
interferes too much
in the operations of British
laws and British

33:47.392 --> 33:49.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
justice.

33:49.160 --> 33:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the third major issue, which
is an odd
one, really, is immigration,
because when

33:53.765 --> 34:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're part of the E.U., you
have to guarantee
freedom of movement and freedom
of working

34:01.273 --> 34:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for every citizen of the E.U. So
they're worried
about their jobs.

34:05.644 --> 34:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, quickly, what
are the main
arguments in the other direction
that Britain

34:11.182 --> 34:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should stay in, and who's making
them?

34:13.251 --> 34:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, the main
lessons are,
Britain is part of Europe, it's
inescapable,

34:19.557 --> 34:21.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even the wars show that.

34:21.359 --> 34:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's security is guaranteed
by being
part of this larger group.
Britain's trade

34:27.265 --> 34:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is heavily toward the European
Union. At least
a million Britons also take
advantage of this

34:34.406 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
freedom of movement and freedom
of labor and
live inside Europe. And the city
of London,

34:40.512 --> 34:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is a big financial center,
benefits
more from being inside the E.U.
than not.

34:46.451 --> 34:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of companies who
are based
in Britain because they want to
be part of

34:50.855 --> 34:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U., but also favor British
labor laws.
So, if Britain leaves, the great
worry is

34:57.262 --> 35:03.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of those companies will
leave, that there
will be capital flight, that
Britain's security

35:03.168 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be diminished. And, also,
the Americans
have been very clear about
wanting Britain

35:07.839 --> 35:09.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to stay in.

35:09.774 --> 35:14.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
exactly what I wanted
to pick up on. What is it felt
is the U.S.'

35:14.279 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stake in all this?

35:15.613 --> 35:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, the U.S.
is not being
altruistic.

35:19.084 --> 35:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. sees Britain as a great
ally, and
it wants its great ally inside
the European

35:25.390 --> 35:32.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union, which has a big effect,
frankly, on
global trade regulations, on
data privacy

35:32.530 --> 35:38.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations. And the U.S. feels,
with its
ally Britain, it has more
influence inside

35:38.269 --> 35:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the European Union than it would
otherwise.

35:41.172 --> 35:46.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, Britain is a big
military power
with France, and it's good to
have Britain

35:46.344 --> 35:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just inside NATO, but inside
the European
Union itself.

35:50.448 --> 35:54.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I guess
you're looking
for a lively debate for the next
four months.

35:54.753 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, it's
going to be lively,
partly because what's added
spice is, now

36:00.191 --> 36:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Conservative leadership is
at stake, because
Boris Johnson, the mayor of
London, who's

36:06.231 --> 36:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always considered slightly
buffoonish, but
also very popular and a possible
prime minister,

36:12.003 --> 36:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has broken with David Cameron,
and is favoring
exit, while Cameron wants to
stay inside.

36:18.610 --> 36:24.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Cameron's quite angry with
Johnson, but
Johnson, I think, sees it as his
best chance

36:24.249 --> 36:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of becoming prime minister down
the road.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Drama at every
level.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steven Erlanger with The New
York Times, we
thank you.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Thank you.

36:36.061 --> 36:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: big hopes in
the fight
against cancer and the potential
for some

36:48.640 --> 36:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
surprising allies: elephants.

36:51.643 --> 36:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd reports
on researchers thinking outside
the box.

36:56.848 --> 37:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &amp; Bailey
performing pachyderms!

37:05.690 --> 37:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: This spring, all of
these circus
elephants will be permanently
retired. But

37:12.063 --> 37:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they leave the center ring,
they are taking
center stage in another unlikely
place, the

37:18.303 --> 37:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Huntsman Cancer Institute in
Salt Lake City.

37:21.306 --> 37:24.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN, Huntsman
Cancer Institute:
Just about every person I met
who heard about

37:24.776 --> 37:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this would come up and ask,
elephants, cancer,
what's the connection?

37:29.581 --> 37:38.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: The possible
connection is a
work in progress, led by
pediatric oncologist

37:38.423 --> 37:40.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Joshua Schiffman.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Insert the needle into
the vein.

37:42.327 --> 37:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: He has enlisted the
support of
the Ringling Bros. Center for
Elephant Conservation

37:47.132 --> 37:52.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Florida and the Hogle Zoo in
Salt Lake
to draw blood from these sturdy
mammals for

37:53.037 --> 37:54.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his experiments.

37:54.906 --> 38:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Logically, elephants should get
cancer far
more often than we do. They have
100 times

38:01.045 --> 38:07.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the cells than humans,
therefore, much more
opportunity for those cells to
mutate into

38:07.452 --> 38:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer. But that's not the case.
Less than
5 percent of elephant deaths are
attributed

38:12.991 --> 38:14.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to cancer.

38:14.926 --> 38:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN: Elephants
have had 55
million years of evolution to
figure out how

38:21.032 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to avoid cancer. Now it's our
turn to take
a page out of nature's playbook,
and try to

38:26.905 --> 38:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure out, how do we help our
patients and
families with cancer?

38:31.209 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Most humans have
two copies of
a gene called p53. When
everything is working,

38:38.483 --> 38:44.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the protein in p53 is a
cancer-suppressor,
repairing or killing mutant
cells so they

38:44.923 --> 38:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't multiply. Elephants have
40 copies of
p53.

38:49.794 --> 38:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN: This is
our tissue culture
room. This is where we actually
do the experiments

38:55.533 --> 39:03.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to understand, how does
elephant p53
work? In here are the actual
cells growing.

39:03.107 --> 39:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: After bombarding
elephant blood
with radiation, Dr. Schiffman
and his team

39:08.613 --> 39:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stood back and observed how the
elephant p53
responded to the damaged cells.
The answer,

39:16.521 --> 39:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently published in "The
Journal of the
American Medical Association,"
was that the

39:20.825 --> 39:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
multiple genes responded far
more robustly
than p53's response in humans.

39:26.631 --> 39:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN: Instead of
trying to
repair themselves, the elephant
cells, many

39:33.738 --> 39:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them, all went on to cell
death, to this
cell suicide, or what we call
apoptosis.

39:39.844 --> 39:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's as if these elephant cells
have said,
well, it's much safer, much
better strategy

39:43.881 --> 39:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to just kill the cell and start
over. If we
do that, there's no way that
that cell can

39:50.088 --> 39:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go on to become cancer, and that
was an aha
moment for us in the lab. We're
trying to

39:55.860 --> 40:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
learn how to get kids better
with cancer without
making them sick.

40:00.398 --> 40:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Now the research
has turned to
this question: How does elephant
p53 respond

40:06.738 --> 40:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in human cancer cells? And could
it stop the
disease cold? Could it be a
treatment to prevent

40:13.278 --> 40:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cancer or halt its growth?

40:15.313 --> 40:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN: In here
are three breast
cancers from different
individuals that have

40:21.386 --> 40:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been growing in the labs. And we
take the
elephant p53 and transfect it.
We put it into

40:28.426 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the breast cancer cell lines,
and we wait
and we see, will the elephant
p53 kill these

40:35.667 --> 40:39.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
breast cancer cells?

40:39.570 --> 40:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The research, and
where it may
lead, would be especially
meaningful for people

40:47.011 --> 40:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Tony Means. He and others
with a genetic
disorder called Li-Fraumeni
Syndrome have

40:54.118 --> 41:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only one p53 gene, instead of
two, leaving
them virtually defenseless
against cancer.

41:01.326 --> 41:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In your family, your mother had
Li-Fraumeni,
died very young.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY MEANS, Cancer Patient: Yes,
ma'am.

41:07.965 --> 41:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: You have aunts and
uncles who
have cancer and have
Li-Fraumeni.

41:12.837 --> 41:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY MEANS: Yes, a good chunk of
our family.
I would say a majority,

41:16.007 --> 41:18.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: And they have all
been tested?
They have...

41:18.576 --> 41:19.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:19.877 --> 41:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY MEANS: Well, every single
one has been
Li-Fraumeni.

41:21.879 --> 41:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Means is being
treated for cancer
and 6-year-old daughter Emma is
being watched

41:26.184 --> 41:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Dr. Schiffman because of a
small brain
tumor. Two other children with
Li-Fraumeni

41:31.989 --> 41:37.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are frequently screened, and the
family takes
part in Dr. Schiffman's research
in any way

41:37.662 --> 41:39.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
they can.

41:39.530 --> 41:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY MEANS: I have kind of put
hope in him
by choosing to have children,
knowing that

41:43.534 --> 41:45.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's a chance they could have
the gene.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: But you understand
this is years
off, if ever.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TONY MEANS: Oh, yes, yes.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: If ever.

41:52.477 --> 41:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY MEANS: Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes. Who knows?

41:56.047 --> 42:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: And that is where
Avi Schroeder
comes in. Dr. Schroeder of
Technion, the Israel

42:02.220 --> 42:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Institute of Technology, joined
the research
several months ago, with the
goal of developing

42:07.725 --> 42:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a drug for humans that would
mimic the elephant's
robust p53.

42:12.397 --> 42:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AVI SCHROEDER, Technion: Now
there's a delivery
issue. How can we get that
protein to the

42:17.869 --> 42:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disease site, into the cancer
cells, to act
and to perform the therapeutic
activity on

42:24.108 --> 42:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site? We're going to wrap the
proteins inside
a nanoparticle, and they will
release the

42:29.514 --> 42:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protein inside the cancer cells.

42:31.315 --> 42:34.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: And if everything
works, the
cancer cell will be killed?

42:35.052 --> 42:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AVI SCHROEDER: Yes, the cancer
cell will go
into a death cycle after that,
yes.

42:40.191 --> 42:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We are excited to have Dr.
Schroeder
here.

42:43.361 --> 42:49.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: The team of
optimists believes
clinical trials could begin in
three years.

42:50.067 --> 42:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not surprisingly, there is
skepticism in the
medical community, and that is
shared by Dr.

42:55.873 --> 42:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lee Helman, the head of clinical
research
at the National Cancer
Institute.

42:59.477 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LEE HELMAN, National Cancer
Institute:
The whole idea of putting an
elephant gene

43:05.149 --> 43:09.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's regulated in a unique way
into a human
being, when we have had enough
trouble putting

43:10.087 --> 43:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human genes into human beings
with all kinds
of difficulty, I would say he
has got a lot

43:14.892 --> 43:16.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of hurdles to overcome.

43:16.794 --> 43:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: But Dr. Helman does
believe there
is value to this deeper
investigation into

43:23.201 --> 43:25.002 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
p53.

43:25.102 --> 43:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. LEE HELMAN: I think his
finding only lends
further evidence to support that
hypothesis

43:31.209 --> 43:36.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that p53 function, and
understanding it and
being able to regulate it, would
be a major

43:37.048 --> 43:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
step forward in our ability to
treat cancer.

43:40.251 --> 43:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Cancer touches
almost every family,
directly or indirectly. For
families like

43:45.990 --> 43:47.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Means, it is a certainty.

43:47.758 --> 43:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is happening in this
lab, at this
zoo, could be life- changing.

43:53.531 --> 43:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you taken the kids to the
zoo to see
the elephants?

43:56.501 --> 44:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY MEANS: Yes. Oh, man, that
was awesome.
The kids loved it, and it was
kind of fun

44:00.838 --> 44:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for me to sit there as a father
and just look
at them. This is the answer in
their lifetime.

44:06.110 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's all I want is for my kids
to have that.
And this -- this gives them
hope.

44:09.981 --> 44:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSHUA SCHIFFMAN: I don't
promise my patients
it will happen, because I don't
want to have

44:14.318 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them disappointed. But if I
didn't believe
this would work, I wouldn't be
trying it.

44:20.491 --> 44:26.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Schiffman
concedes that turning
to elephants for a cancer
treatment is outside

44:27.064 --> 44:33.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the box, but that, he says, is
often where
the best answers are found.

He lived many lives. And he
evolved from someone

45:26.991 --> 45:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was working in the streets
of East New
York, where I grew up, to
someone who was

45:32.997 --> 45:37.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
documenting the condition of an
entire people.

45:37.635 --> 45:40.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's it like
seeing your
father's work in the
Smithsonian?

45:40.504 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN ESPADA: Surreal.

45:42.373 --> 45:46.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Martin Espada,
Frank's son,
is an award-winning poet, a
former tenant

45:46.544 --> 45:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer, and longtime professor
at the University
of Massachusetts.

45:50.915 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His new volume, "Vivas to Those
Who Have Failed"
-- the title comes from a line
by Walt Whitman

45:55.953 --> 45:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- is filled with poems that
remember and
celebrate his father.

45:59.724 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN ESPADA: "I am the
archaeologist. I
sift the shards of you,
cufflinks, passports

46:08.432 --> 46:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photos, a button from the March
on Washington
with a black hand shaking a
white hand, letters

46:14.839 --> 46:20.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Spanish, your birth
certificate from a
town high in the mountains."

46:20.611 --> 46:26.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The poetry about my father is
both elegiac
and documentary. Poets often in
these situations

46:26.917 --> 46:33.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
perform the function of
preachers, right?
People expect you to say
something meaningful

46:33.257 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this age where language has
become divorced
from meaning and we live in a
time of hyper-euphemism.

46:38.529 --> 46:43.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're a
storyteller. You
have got this public role as a
poet, but most

46:43.834 --> 46:45.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all, at that moment, you're a
son.

46:46.003 --> 46:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: Yes, first and
foremost, and
I was feeling that as a son.

46:49.907 --> 46:56.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's an undercurrent of
loss, of grief,
and grappling with grief, and
trying to see

46:56.480 --> 47:01.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ways in which poetry might
be able to
heal grief, if not for me, then
for somebody

47:01.919 --> 47:03.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

47:03.788 --> 47:07.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his poems,
Martin refers
back to old home movies that
show his father,

47:07.224 --> 47:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a man who'd come to New York
from Puerto Rico
as a boy in 1939, and was an
athlete who played

47:13.030 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
semi-pro baseball.

47:15.066 --> 47:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While serving in the Air Force
in 1949, he
was jailed for a week in
Mississippi for not

47:20.271 --> 47:21.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
giving up going to the back of
the bus.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: He said it was
the best week
of his life.

47:23.774 --> 47:25.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The best week?

47:25.609 --> 47:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: The best week of
his life,
because he figured out what to
do with the

47:27.745 --> 47:29.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rest of it.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Frank Espada
would become a
community organizer. He founded
East New York

47:32.750 --> 47:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Action in the early 1960s, and
worked in the
civil rights movement.

47:36.787 --> 47:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: There's little
attention paid,
up to this point, to what we
might call the

47:41.792 --> 47:43.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Latino civil rights movement.

47:43.627 --> 47:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Above all, says
Martin, who
sometimes worked with his
father, he was an

47:47.498 --> 47:54.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artist who documented what he
saw. Frank Espada
published a book in 2006 titled
"The Puerto

47:54.271 --> 47:58.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rican Diaspora: Themes in the
Survival of
a People," and his photographic
work has been

47:59.009 --> 48:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collected by the Smithsonian
American Art
Museum, where Martin and I met
recently.

48:03.581 --> 48:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: I remember this
one. This is
a photograph that was taken in
Hartford. At

48:09.520 --> 48:14.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first glance, this appears to be
a photograph
of three kids on the street.
And, indeed,

48:14.658 --> 48:16.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it is that.

48:16.527 --> 48:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look more closely to
the right,
you will see a notice for a
foreclosure sale

48:23.400 --> 48:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on those premises. And that is
very much a
part of what my father is saying
in that photograph.

48:29.907 --> 48:35.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a poem titled
"Mad Love,"
Martin Espada refers to specific
photographs,

48:35.579 --> 48:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a way of addressing what his
father will
no longer see.

48:39.016 --> 48:44.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: "Not the poet in
a beret grinning
at the vision of shoes for all
the shoeless

48:44.722 --> 48:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people on the earth, not the
dancer hearing
the piano tell her to spin and
spin again,

48:51.929 --> 48:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the grave digger and his
machete, the
bandanna that keeps the dust of
the dead from

48:56.967 --> 49:03.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coating his tongue, not the
union organizer,
spirits floating in the smoke of
his victory

49:03.707 --> 49:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cigar, not the addict in rehab
gazing at herself
like a fortuneteller gazing at
the cards,

49:11.382 --> 49:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the face half-hidden by the
star in the
Puerto Rican flag, the darkness
of his dissident's

49:17.922 --> 49:19.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
eye.

49:19.824 --> 49:26.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Now that my father cannot
speak, they wait
their turn to testify in his
defense, witnesses

49:26.564 --> 49:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the mad love that drove him
to it."

49:29.366 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You say in last
lines here,
"Now that my father cannot
speak."

49:34.104 --> 49:35.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN ESPADA: Yes.

49:35.272 --> 49:37.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You feel a
responsibility to
speak?

49:37.241 --> 49:39.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTIN ESPADA: Absolutely.

49:39.210 --> 49:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My father is gone. He can never
utter another
word. He can never snap another
photograph.

49:45.683 --> 49:53.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's over. And so now comes my
turn. Now
I must speak for him. And now
those faces,

49:53.557 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the faces he documented, also
speak for him.

49:57.094 --> 50:01.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: From the
Smithsonian American
Art Museum, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS

50:01.832 --> 50:03.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NewsHour."

50:03.734 --> 50:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can find Martin
Espada's full
reading of "Mad Love" on our
Poetry page.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,

JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
our "NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

50:23.854 --> 50:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be of interest to you,
too.

50:26.090 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One-hundred-and-six-year-old
Virginia McLaurin
never thought she would live to
see a black

50:31.095 --> 50:35.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president in the White House.
When she was
honored for her volunteer work
in Washington,

50:35.699 --> 50:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
D.C., two years ago, she said
her dream was
to meet President Obama. After
an online campaign,

50:42.740 --> 50:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McLaurin was able to fulfill her
dream, and
even dance with the president
and first lady.

50:48.379 --> 50:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House shared the
moment in this
video it released on social
media.

50:51.982 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Virginia McLaurin?

50:53.817 --> 50:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN, Volunteer:
Hi!

50:54.518 --> 50:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: How are you?

50:55.252 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: I'm fine.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Oh, it's so nice
to see you.

50:57.454 --> 50:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: It's an
honor. It's an
honor.

50:58.489 --> 50:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: You want to say hi
to Michelle?

50:59.156 --> 51:00.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: Yes!

51:00.491 --> 51:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Slow down now.
Don't go too
quick. She's 106!

51:01.859 --> 51:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady: No,
you are not.
You are not 106.

51:03.060 --> 51:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Well, you got to
-- you, slow
down.

51:03.894 --> 51:04.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA: Oh, my goodness.

51:04.662 --> 51:05.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: Thank you.

51:06.096 --> 51:06.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA: You are not -- I
want to be
like you when I grow up.

51:06.830 --> 51:07.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: You can.

51:07.264 --> 51:08.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:08.165 --> 51:09.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: She's dancing.
Come on.

51:09.300 --> 51:10.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what's the secret to still
dancing at
106?

51:10.501 --> 51:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: Just keep
moving. I am
so happy.

51:11.502 --> 51:13.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA: We are happy to
have you.

51:13.370 --> 51:14.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: A black
president.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA: Look at him,
right there.

51:17.041 --> 51:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: A black wife.

51:18.776 --> 51:20.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA: That's me.

51:21.011 --> 51:22.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: Yes.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:24.048 --> 51:28.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: And I'm here
to celebrate
black history.

51:28.218 --> 51:30.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: That's exactly
right.

51:30.988 --> 51:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIRGINIA MCLAURIN: Yes. That's
what I'm here
for.

51:35.459 --> 51:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Well, we're glad
to have you
here.

51:40.431 --> 51:54.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to know
what her secret
is.

51:54.244 --> 51:58.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I have watched that
a dozen times,
and I crack up laughing at
Virginia McLaurin

51:58.349 --> 51:59.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every single time. She's
fabulous.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She absolutely
is.

52:01.418 --> 52:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On "Independent
Lens" tonight:
a look at the tangled Web
between an FBI informant,

52:05.656 --> 52:10.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his targets, and government
efforts to protect
the U.S. homeland. "Terror"
tells the story

52:10.527 --> 52:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a 62-year old Black Panther
turned counterterrorism
informant, caught between the
competing narratives

52:16.400 --> 52:21.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of FBI officials who believe
targets may be
a potential jihadist threat and
the targets

52:21.338 --> 52:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves who deny supporting
Islamic extremism.

52:25.142 --> 52:35.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They call me to do an
assignment in Pittsburgh.
Whatever the case may be, if
they want me

52:35.552 --> 52:51.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do surveillance, I'm going to
do it, you
know? I need the money. I need
the money.

52:51.835 --> 53:08.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these are just -- these
are all targets
in suspected areas. For some of
these, they

53:08.552 --> 53:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have got a big population of
Muslims that
come from the various countries
over there

53:13.157 --> 53:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to come to school here,
Moroccans, Somalis,
Iranians, Saudis. And then they
all go back

53:23.333 --> 53:26.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to where they come from.

53:26.336 --> 53:32.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have no feelings for
them. They're
making Islam look bad. You got
to go.

53:32.609 --> 53:36.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: "Independent lens"
airs tonight
on most PBS stations.

53:36.780 --> 53:41.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: If you
kept track
of the data scientists collect
on climate

53:41.351 --> 53:46.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, you would see diagrams
on everything
from temperature rise to glacial
melt. But

53:46.156 --> 53:50.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artist Jill Pelto sees something
even more
striking, and she takes those
stats and turns

53:50.794 --> 53:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them into vibrant watercolors.
We have a gallery
