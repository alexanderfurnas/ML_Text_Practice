JUDY WOODRUFF: In what
was perhaps the most
consequential decision
in Britain this century,

00:05.133 --> 00:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters are now having second
thoughts about their choice
to leave the European Union.

00:09.466 --> 00:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A new opinion poll shows
a majority of British
people now want to stay,
and business leaders

00:16.500 --> 00:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are warning their once
flourishing economy
will flounder unless
the right compromise

00:21.733 --> 00:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is reached with the E.U.
during exit negotiations.

00:23.866 --> 00:28.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Add to that a deeply
divided government after
the recent election has
left a hung Parliament,

00:29.600 --> 00:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it has become harder for
many to keep calm and carry on.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Aldeburgh
in Eastern England,
this is Brexit beach.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The town's centuries'
old fishing tradition
is on its deathbed.

00:46.866 --> 00:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In common with kindred coastal
communities around the country,
fishermen voted to leave

00:51.366 --> 00:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

00:53.433 --> 00:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe excessive
regulation from Brussels
is killing their industry.

One year after Britain's
so-called independence
day, Mark Foreman is
worried that the country's

01:03.133 --> 01:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
commitment to
Brexit is wavering.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK FOREMAN, Fisherman:
I thought that would
improve the fishing
situation, but now I have

01:08.866 --> 01:10.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got my doubts.

01:10.366 --> 01:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would have still come out
anyway for anything else.

01:11.966 --> 01:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want the country to be run by
British people, not by the E.U.

01:15.766 --> 01:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there's too many
people who are in power who
are against Brexit, and I think

01:20.100 --> 01:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are so many people
with money tied up in Europe.

01:23.266 --> 01:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just don't
want to come out.

01:27.333 --> 01:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The government
has promised to revitalize the
fishing industry post-Brexit,

01:31.766 --> 01:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, in the current climate,
Kirk Stripling fears betrayal.

01:36.066 --> 01:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIRK STRIPLING, Fisherman:
I'm really afraid that we
will be sold down the river.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They will do a deal
over something else and
sacrifice us fishermen.

01:41.866 --> 01:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in a ludicrous situation,
where we only catch what is in
season at the time and which

01:46.833 --> 01:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is on our doorstep.

01:48.966 --> 01:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And quite often, we can have
loads of the fish in the sea
right here and we have got

01:52.066 --> 01:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no quota to catch it.

01:53.633 --> 01:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we sit here and starve to
death, while the fish swim by.

01:57.033 --> 02:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Polar opposite
views about Europe prevail
80 miles away in Cambridge,

02:01.600 --> 02:05.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a historic seat of
learning and innovation.

02:05.500 --> 02:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Britain's
Silicon Valley, whose
ethos is that science is
collaborative and requires

02:11.600 --> 02:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an international,
frontier-free mentality.

02:14.833 --> 02:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But campus director
Professor Michael Wakelam
fears its cutting-edge
biotech research and

02:19.766 --> 02:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
development could be jeopardized
by what some perceive as the
xenophobic nature of Brexit.

02:26.833 --> 02:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL WAKELAM, Professor: We
will have a reduced access to
the talent pool within Europe.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, secondly, what Brexit
says about our approach as a
country is that people no longer

02:36.166 --> 02:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to work with us.

02:38.733 --> 02:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a perception
that Britain is no longer
a welcoming place for
talented people to come.

02:44.533 --> 02:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Cambridge-based
entrepreneur David Cleevely
specializes in turning great

02:48.100 --> 02:50.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ideas into profitable
businesses.

02:50.233 --> 02:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A self-proclaimed angel
investor, he disputes
the Brexit mantra that
leaving the E.U. would

02:57.233 --> 03:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enable British companies
to exploit untapped markets
in the rest of the world.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CLEEVELY, Entrepreneur:
We do business in some of the
most difficult countries, in

03:03.566 --> 03:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pakistan, or in Nigeria
or other countries, for
example, in South America.

03:08.433 --> 03:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the amount of extra margin
there is there for increasing
those exports is, quite frankly,

03:15.466 --> 03:17.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
limited.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My concern about Brexit is
that we have a big market just
a few miles away, and we're

03:22.900 --> 03:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to be able to access
it as freely as we could before.

03:26.266 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According
to a new opinion poll, the
result of the Brexit referendum

03:30.933 --> 03:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would be reversed if
it was held today.

03:34.166 --> 03:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The survey showed that a clear
majority, 54 percent, would vote
to remain within the European

03:39.033 --> 03:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Union, and 46 percent
would decide to leave.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's quite clear that many
Britons regret the decision
they made last year, and perhaps

03:46.400 --> 03:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wish that the Brexit
mechanism could be reversed.

03:50.066 --> 03:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to experts, that's
technically possible, but
it's unlikely to happen.

03:54.900 --> 03:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Trinity College,
professor Catherine
Barnard believes the recent
election, which left Britain

03:59.833 --> 04:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a minority government,
has further undermined
its hand during protracted
talks to withdraw

04:05.566 --> 04:07.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Europe.

04:07.566 --> 04:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE BARNARD, Trinity
College: In reality, the U.K.
is in a somewhat weak bargaining

04:10.466 --> 04:12.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

04:12.566 --> 04:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The famous phrase is to have
your cake and eat it, that
it would be possible both to

04:14.933 --> 04:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
leave the European
Union, but have the
best bits of membership.

04:18.900 --> 04:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's always been clear that
the E.U. wasn't going to allow
this, because why would they?

04:23.200 --> 04:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's not in the E.U.'s
interests for a country
to do what the U.K. did.

04:27.500 --> 04:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's in the E.U.'s
interests, as Chancellor
Merkel has said, is
to look after the E.U.

04:33.633 --> 04:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
27, which means being
tough on the U.K.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This monument
commemorates the Great Fire
of London, which wiped out

04:39.800 --> 04:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much of England's
capital in 1666.

04:43.300 --> 04:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many economists fear that Brexit
will have a similar impact on
the city of London, Europe's

04:47.933 --> 04:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
biggest financial
services center.

04:50.366 --> 04:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Japanese bank Nomura has
said it will move some of its
operations to Germany after

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Brexit.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Others may join the exodus.

04:57.633 --> 05:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This week, a city of
London delegation is
heading to Brussels to
appeal for a free trade

05:02.166 --> 05:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal to preserve a sector
that generates 12 percent
of Britain's income.

Jens Torpe is the Danish
publisher of a daily
business newspaper.

05:11.166 --> 05:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS TORPE, Newspaper
Publisher: I think,
inevitably, that a number
of bankers and institutions

05:15.100 --> 05:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would have to move
over to the continent.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about half-a-million
people working here.

05:19.800 --> 05:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you would see at
least some 50,000 moving out.

05:23.433 --> 05:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's going
to have quite dramatic
implications for the city.

05:26.966 --> 05:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The latest growth figures
for Britain put us down
on the same par as Italy.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We used to be number one in
the E.U., so everybody agrees
that there is a crisis coming.

05:40.233 --> 05:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: London's
cosmopolitan Borough
Market is flourishing
again after last month's

05:45.400 --> 05:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamist terror attack in which
eight people were murdered.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some traders favor a so-called
soft Brexit, which would permit
the continued free movement

05:53.666 --> 05:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of goods and people
from the continent.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A hard Brexit would mean the
reimposition of import tariffs
and restrict the migration

06:01.733 --> 06:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of E.U. citizens.

06:07.733 --> 06:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIANNA KOLOOKOTRONI,
Vendor: It is a little
bit scary, I have to say.

06:11.266 --> 06:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I am trying to remain
positive, and I really hope
that nothing is going to change,

06:17.666 --> 06:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it's not in the
interests of anyone, really.

06:20.733 --> 06:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Thea Wunder
is from Italy's border with
Austria, and she fears customs

06:28.200 --> 06:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
duty resulting from a
hard Brexit would compound
price increases on her
meat products, caused

06:32.933 --> 06:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the British currency dropping
in value after the referendum.

06:35.666 --> 06:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THEA WUNDER, Vendor: So the
exchange rate, it has already
affected it, so the euro has

06:41.800 --> 06:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much more value
than it used to be.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I already -- the business
already loses money on that.

06:46.700 --> 06:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's only so much we
can put our prices up to be
still fair and competitive.

06:54.233 --> 06:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Britain's
tourism and hospitality
industry generates 10
percent of the nation's

06:58.833 --> 07:00.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
income.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It relies heavily on foreign
workers; 25 percent of the three
million people in this field

07:05.700 --> 07:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comes from the European Union.

is originally from Somalia.

07:10.233 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHIR ISSA, Duty Manager:
British people are not working
in the industry, and we need

07:13.433 --> 07:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have the European community
or anywhere else in the
world coming to us with their

07:19.833 --> 07:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expertise, helping us
and the industry to grow.

07:22.433 --> 07:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
industry wants to preserve
freedom of movement, and
is lobbying the government

07:25.766 --> 07:26.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hard.

Spokesman Vernon Hunte:

07:29.266 --> 07:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VERNON HUNTE, Hospitality
Industry Spokesman: We
believe that the economy
must be put first,

07:31.366 --> 07:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the British industry,
especially, of course, from
our perspective, hospitality

07:34.433 --> 07:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
businesses, their needs and
requirements are put first.

07:36.766 --> 07:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK WARD, Britain: Independent
doesn't mean isolated.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's an interactive
independence.

07:41.366 --> 07:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where do people get this idea
that, when you're independent,
you're closing your doors?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're mad.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nick
Ward relishes the
freedom of motorcycling.

07:51.133 --> 07:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independence and national
sovereignty drive his
continued support for Brexit.

07:54.833 --> 07:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK WARD: There's more
to it than economics.

07:58.500 --> 08:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Brexit actually means is
that you want to control your
own borders and you want to
