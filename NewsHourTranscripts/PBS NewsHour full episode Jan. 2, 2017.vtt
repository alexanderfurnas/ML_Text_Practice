WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Good evening.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

00:07.374 --> 00:10.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
nationwide manhunt
is under way in Turkey for the
attacker who

00:10.644 --> 00:13.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed 39 people on New Year's
Eve.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead, we launch our series
The Obama
Years.

00:16.516 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we explore President
Obama's conservation
legacy, a look at the outgoing
president's

00:21.588 --> 00:24.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groundbreaking moves securing
federal lands
and waters.

00:24.424 --> 00:29.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN, The Washington
Post: I think
there's no question that he is
one of the

00:29.429 --> 00:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most consequential presidents
when it comes
to the environment.

00:32.666 --> 00:38.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He really has made it a
centerpiece of his
domestic policy and even his
foreign policy.

00:38.038 --> 00:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Plus: seeking
justice for
the victims of the genocide in
Rwanda, the

00:42.576 --> 00:45.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult road bringing war
criminals to court.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.614 --> 00:51.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.919 --> 01:03.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They're still
searching
tonight for the man behind the
latest terror

01:03.430 --> 01:05.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attack in Turkey.

01:05.232 --> 01:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He left 39 dead and nearly 70
wounded, and
a claim of responsibility came
today, even

01:09.870 --> 01:14.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as police said they're getting
closer to identifying
the suspect.

01:14.808 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the clearest look yet at
the alleged
gunman who attacked the Reina
club early New

01:18.845 --> 01:20.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Year's morning.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkish officials say he rained
bullets and
explosives on holiday revelers.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deputy prime minister said
the investigation
is progressing.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NUMAN KURTULMUS, Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister
(through translator):
Information about the

01:29.957 --> 01:33.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fingerprints and basic
appearance of the terrorist
have been found.

01:33.727 --> 01:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hope that we will find not
only the terrorist,
but also his connections and
those who gave

01:37.698 --> 01:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him support inside and outside
the club.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hours earlier,
the Islamic
State group claimed
responsibility, and called

01:43.937 --> 01:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the gunman a heroic soldier of
the caliphate.

01:46.974 --> 01:51.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statement said: "The blood
of Muslims
that is being shed by Turkey's
airstrikes

01:51.411 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and artillery shelling will turn
into fire
on its territories."

01:57.451 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has been a key member of
the air campaign
against ISIS and has sent troops
into Syria

02:02.122 --> 02:04.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in part to fight the group.

02:04.157 --> 02:08.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, Turkey's military vowed
to continue
strikes on Islamic State
fighters.

02:08.495 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it released new footage of
air raids on
ISIS positions in Syria.

02:13.533 --> 02:19.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Istanbul,
survivors of the nightclub
attack painted a more detailed
picture of

02:19.439 --> 02:21.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mayhem that occurred early
Sunday.

02:21.608 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): As
soon as he entered
the club, he started firing and
he didn't

02:25.612 --> 02:26.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stop.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He fired nonstop for 20 minutes
at least.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We thought that there were
several of them
because it just didn't stop.

02:32.252 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The site is a
popular attraction
for tourists, and the majority
of the victims

02:36.990 --> 02:38.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were foreign-born.

02:38.425 --> 02:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One American citizen was wounded
in the attack,
but returned home today.

02:43.563 --> 02:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the latest in a string of
bloody incidents
and security lapses to take
place on Turkish

02:48.668 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soil.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just two weeks ago, a gunman
assassinated
the Russian ambassador.

02:52.639 --> 02:59.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in June, three suicide
bombers struck
Istanbul's Ataturk Airport,
killing 45 people.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That attack was also blamed on
ISIS.

03:02.616 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: The new
year is off
to a deadly start in Iraq.

03:06.453 --> 03:11.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A suicide bomber detonated a
truck bomb today
at a busy Baghdad market,
killing at least

03:11.425 --> 03:12.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
36 people.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Islamic State group claimed
responsibility.

03:14.928 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bomber pretended to be
looking to hire
day laborers and then set off
the explosion.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In addition to the dead, 52
people were wounded.

03:22.169 --> 03:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, appearing with the
visiting president
of France, Iraqi Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi

03:26.973 --> 03:28.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vowed to beat ISIS.

03:28.809 --> 03:32.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister (through
translator): I ask the security
forces and

03:32.646 --> 03:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Iraqi people to be alert.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The terrorists are again
attacking civilians.

03:36.349 --> 03:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I promise the Iraqi people and
the French
president and all the countries
suffering

03:40.187 --> 03:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks by the Islamic State
group that we
are fighting to finish them.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This was the
third attack
claimed by ISIS in as many days
in and around

03:47.828 --> 03:49.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Baghdad.

03:49.663 --> 03:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sixty miles to the north, in
Samarra, gunmen
wearing suicide vests attacked
police stations

03:53.100 --> 03:56.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
late today, killing at least
seven officers.

03:56.269 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Brazil, a riot at a prison
left at least
60 inmates dead.

04:00.207 --> 04:04.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were chaotic scenes
outside the prison
in northern Amazonas state as
the killings

04:04.911 --> 04:06.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
erupted inside.

04:06.313 --> 04:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities said several of the
inmates were
beheaded or dismembered.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Others escaped.

04:11.618 --> 04:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials blamed a fight between
members of
two crime gangs for the attacks.

04:15.755 --> 04:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, 2016 ended
as one of
the most violent years ever in
Chicago.

04:21.228 --> 04:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city saw 762 homicides, the
most in two
decades.

04:26.133 --> 04:29.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's more than New York and
Los Angeles
combined.

04:29.136 --> 04:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were 1,100 more
shooting incidents
in 2016 than the year before.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump tweeted
his reaction
to these numbers, saying: "If
mayor can't

04:38.612 --> 04:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do it, he must ask for federal
help."

04:41.615 --> 04:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In another series of tweets, the
president-elect
also dismissed those who
questioned whether

04:45.819 --> 04:47.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he'd win last fall.

04:47.521 --> 04:52.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump said he thought he'd
easily get more
than the 270 electoral votes
needed.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He ended up with 304.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton won the popular
vote by nearly
2.9 million.

04:58.031 --> 05:02.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, Trump spokesman Sean
Spicer played
down findings about Russian
hacking.

05:02.602 --> 05:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told FOX News -- quote --
"There is zero
evidence that they influenced
the election."

05:07.240 --> 05:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Turkey's
struggle to stop an onslaught of
terror attacks;

05:12.045 --> 05:18.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new year and a new president,
looking ahead
to politics in 2017; plus,
looking back on

05:18.351 --> 05:28.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's effort to
conserve millions
of acres of land and water.

05:28.395 --> 05:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's effort to
conserve millions
of acres of land and water.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We return now to Turkey and this
weekend's
deadly attack in Istanbul.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's behind that terror
incident and the
string of terror attacks in
Turkey that have

05:40.974 --> 05:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken place over there over the
past year?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We drill down on this with
Bulent Aliriza.

05:45.845 --> 05:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He directs the Turkey Project at
the Center
for Strategic and International
Studies.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

05:51.718 --> 05:55.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS has claimed responsibility
for this latest
attack on New Year's Eve.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think the evidence will
point that
they're in fact the
perpetrators?

05:58.658 --> 06:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: Well, we do have a
statement by ISIS

06:02.195 --> 06:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that, in fact, it was
responsible for this
outrage in Istanbul.

06:06.733 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's actually the first time
that ISIS has
claimed responsibility for
terrorist acts

06:11.304 --> 06:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Turkey, although a number of
acts of terrorism
have been attributed to ISIS.

06:16.610 --> 06:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The method of operation by the
gunman -- apparently,
it was a single gunman involved
-- very much

06:22.916 --> 06:25.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
suggests that this was ISIS.

06:25.285 --> 06:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I said, there is a
statement by ISIS
that it did it.

06:29.189 --> 06:34.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, it's important to
note that, back
on November 2, soon after the
assault on Mosul

06:34.861 --> 06:41.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began, Baghdadi, the leaders of
ISIS, made
a statement, part of which was
devoted to

06:41.134 --> 06:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey, in which he asked his
followers to
move against Turkey because
Turkey had become,

06:47.907 --> 06:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he called it, an apostate
state and, therefore,
attacks against Turkey were
warranted.

06:52.679 --> 06:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Turkey has
obviously been
suffering attacks not just from
ISIS, but

06:56.449 --> 06:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also from Kurdish militant
groups.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those people who haven't
been following
this closely, can you explain
this sort of

07:01.554 --> 07:03.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two-front attack on Turkey?

07:03.323 --> 07:07.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well, it's
exactly as you
put it, a two-front attack on
Turkey.

07:07.127 --> 07:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has been grappling with
Kurdish separatist
terrorism all the way back to
1984.

07:12.232 --> 07:17.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been efforts to
actually solve
the problem, the Kurdish problem
within Turkey.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they essentially collapsed
in the middle
of 2015.

07:20.907 --> 07:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, Turkey has been
reengaged in fighting
against the PKK, which is the
Kurdish separatist

07:27.981 --> 07:29.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrorist organization.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
More recently, it's been
challenged by ISIS.

07:32.619 --> 07:38.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, either of these challenges
would be daunting
for any state around the world.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The scourge of terrorism
bedevils the entire
world.

07:41.294 --> 07:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for a country to have to
fight two very
potent terrorist organizations
within its

07:47.000 --> 07:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
borders, within its capital
city, within its
most important city, Istanbul,
the way that

07:52.272 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's been forced to during the
past 15, 18
months, is frankly very, very
difficult.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How has
Erdogan been responding
to these attacks thus far?

08:02.015 --> 08:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well, he and his
ministers
have been saying that the
security forces

08:08.421 --> 08:09.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will eventually defeat
terrorism.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that's a daunting task, as
I said, for
any state around the world.

08:13.326 --> 08:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the U.S. has not actually
-- with all
the effort that is made to deal
with terrorism,

08:18.598 --> 08:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not got to the position where it
says the
terrorist threat to the U.S. is
over.

08:22.535 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in Turkey's case, the fact
that it's
to the north of two ongoing
wars, in Syria

08:29.309 --> 08:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iraq, where some of the
terrorists who
are actually also intent on
harming Turkey

08:36.082 --> 08:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are active makes it so much more
difficult
for Turkey to try to solve the
problem within

08:40.453 --> 08:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its borders, given the fact, as
I said, that
it comes from without.

08:43.490 --> 08:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean,
Erdogan is also,
as we speak right now, going
through this

08:47.293 --> 08:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very lengthy purge of officers
up and down
the government that he argues
were involved

08:52.332 --> 08:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in this recent coup attempt.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does that complicate their
fight against
terrorism within their own
borders?

08:58.238 --> 09:04.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well, it
complicates it immensely,
because dealing with these two
threats was

09:04.310 --> 09:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult enough, and then we
had a failed
coup attempt on July 15.

09:08.681 --> 09:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has moved against
the followers
of Fethullah Gulen that it
alleges were involved

09:14.487 --> 09:16.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in this.

09:16.322 --> 09:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is the
religious figure
who is here in the U.S. that
Erdogan argues

09:19.626 --> 09:21.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was behind the coup.

09:21.394 --> 09:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: And the Turkish
government
has asked for his extradition,
and that has

09:25.098 --> 09:27.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not happened so far.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of the reasons why
there is tension
between Ankara and Washington
currently.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, there has been a purge.

09:34.908 --> 09:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attention of the government
has been directed
at rooting out of the system
those it believes

09:41.848 --> 09:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be involved or are somehow
implicated or
are sympathetic to the coup.

09:47.620 --> 09:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And parallel to that, you have
the twin threats,
the unprecedented twin threats
from ISIS and

09:54.394 --> 09:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the PKK, and that is taxing the
capabilities
of the Turkish state.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Syria is also
involved in
these -- I'm sorry -- Turkey is
also involved

10:02.535 --> 10:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in some of the cease-fire that
has been going
on in Syria.

10:05.839 --> 10:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there any sense that you have
that, if
things were to calm down there
and the cease-fire

10:10.143 --> 10:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were to really hold, that that
might ease
some of the pressure on Turkey?

10:13.746 --> 10:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well, it could,
but the Turkish
position, which is now
coordinated with Russia,

10:22.188 --> 10:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is predicated on Turkey's
ability to persuade
the opposition fighters, many of
whom Turkey

10:27.961 --> 10:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been backing for the past
five years,
to essentially lay down their
guns and to

10:32.398 --> 10:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accept Bashar al-Assad as -- at
least for
the foreseeable future, as the
president of

10:37.604 --> 10:39.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

10:39.405 --> 10:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that clearly is going to be
difficult
for some of the opposition
groups to accept.

10:43.676 --> 10:50.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the ability of Turkey and
Russia to actually
hold the cease-fire and bring
lasting peace

10:50.183 --> 10:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Syria is something that I
have grave doubts
about.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, very
quickly, we
obviously have a new
administration coming

10:56.256 --> 10:57.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you think the Trump
administration, this
will change the calculus for
him?

10:59.759 --> 11:03.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Well,
inevitably, there will
be a different emphasis once the
president-elect

11:03.796 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
takes office.

11:05.398 --> 11:10.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been growing tension
between President
Erdogan and President Obama.

11:10.937 --> 11:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S.-Turkish relationship
has been going
through a very difficult period.

11:14.507 --> 11:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, there are hopes in
Ankara that it
will be easier with a new
administration.

11:19.979 --> 11:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's unclear exactly which
way the new
administration is going to go
with Turkey

11:24.517 --> 11:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or with the Middle East or,
frankly, with
the rest of the world.

11:26.853 --> 11:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Bulent Aliriza,
thank you very much for being
here.

11:31.190 --> 11:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BULENT ALIRIZA: Thank you.

11:38.364 --> 11:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The new
Congress starts
work this week, and Republicans
will have

11:44.304 --> 11:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majorities in the House and
Senate.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And very soon they will have a
Republican
president as well.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what's high on the GOP's
agenda?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's Politics Monday.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm joined, as always, by
Amy Walter of
The Cook Political Report and
Tamara Keith

11:56.649 --> 11:58.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of NPR.

11:58.117 --> 12:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this week, they are also
joined by our
very own Lisa Desjardins.

12:00.987 --> 12:01.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Happy new year.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you all.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Happy
new year.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Happy
new year.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Glad to be
here.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lisa, I want
to start with
you.

12:07.093 --> 12:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You were just up on the Hill.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is high on the GOP's list?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I could go into
a lot of
details, but essentially
dismantling the eight

12:12.065 --> 12:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years of the Obama presidency.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're going to start right
away with
actions that lead toward the
repeal of the

12:17.503 --> 12:18.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's complicated.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the end, it's going to be a
three-step
process, but they are going to
start with

12:21.874 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the process this week with votes
Tuesday,
Wednesday.

12:25.111 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also going to try and
set up a process
where they can start immediately
rolling back

12:29.282 --> 12:31.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some Obama regulations.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Think about the environment in
particular.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there is going to be
potentially
a drawn-out fight over some of
these Cabinet

12:37.824 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nominees.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk
about the ACA
there in particular.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is that going to look?

12:42.462 --> 12:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, that's really
-- we all
are going, well, nobody quite
knows.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even Republicans don't quite
know.

12:49.402 --> 12:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since the Obamacare passed,
Republicans
have campaigned on dismantling
it.

12:54.674 --> 12:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet here we are, with a
Republican Congress
about to come in, a Republican
president about

12:59.212 --> 13:00.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to come in.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a dismantling plan,
but not a how
to replace it plan.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And that is...

13:05.718 --> 13:06.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:06.886 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They have got
the repeal
part down.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The repeal part, not
the replace
part down, which is where all of
the real

13:10.857 --> 13:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
action, when Lisa talks about
how complicated
it is, the replacing it.

13:13.693 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will tell you, just in talking
with voters,
even post-election, and I'm sure
you saw this

13:18.031 --> 13:22.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
too during campaign, the
frustration that
voters have about Obamacare,
especially in

13:22.669 --> 13:26.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the last week before the
election, when notices
went out that their premiums
were rising,

13:26.839 --> 13:29.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is cost, very simply.

13:29.575 --> 13:34.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for Republicans,
the danger is
that, at the end of the day, if
they repeal

13:34.781 --> 13:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this and do not replace it with
something
that helps to bring costs down,
that they

13:40.353 --> 13:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are then going to get blamed for
not fixing
something that they also didn't
feel particularly

13:46.359 --> 13:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
good about what Obama did to it.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And something like
43 percent
of Americans actually support
the Affordable

13:53.166 --> 13:55.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

13:55.134 --> 13:58.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that's obviously not a
majority of Americans,
but that's 43 percent of people
who you really

13:58.471 --> 14:00.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
don't want to upset.

14:00.239 --> 14:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, there are something like
20 million
people who have gotten health
insurance as

14:05.044 --> 14:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a result of the Affordable Care
Act.

14:06.746 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who have gotten
expanded
Medicaid, even in Republican
states.

14:11.084 --> 14:15.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you have seen some
Republican senators
say things like, well, we don't
want -- let's

14:15.555 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not rush to do that just yet.

14:17.657 --> 14:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we need to find
something for these
people who've gotten health
coverage who didn't

14:21.594 --> 14:23.329 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have it.

14:23.362 --> 14:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the most unpopular parts of
Obamacare
also come with popular parts of
the law that

14:30.236 --> 14:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't necessarily advertised as
part of the
Affordable Care Act or things
that people

14:35.308 --> 14:37.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
realize are part of it.

14:37.176 --> 14:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And repeal gets rid of all those
things, which
is why there is a lot of
fuzziness about replace

14:42.181 --> 14:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or like whether they would phase
in the repeal.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe even -- I have seen
the idea that
it could be pushed as far back
as past the

14:49.956 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next presidential election.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, they would
repeal it
perhaps this week on paper...

14:53.826 --> 14:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: On a delay.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ... but then
push off the
actual replace part.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's even more
complicated
than that, thank goodness.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:01.100 --> 15:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The repeal
probably will
be at the end of the month.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are three steps.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we don't even need to get
into that.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is they have -- in
this whole
conversation -- I'm sure our
viewers are picking

15:08.541 --> 15:13.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up on it -- a space-time
continuum problem
with how they do this, because
there are people

15:13.780 --> 15:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who want the repeal to happen
right away.

15:15.782 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truth is, a system like this
Obamacare
or any health care system takes
a lot of time,

15:20.253 --> 15:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there are many Republicans
who want to
say, we want to take our time
figuring out

15:23.556 --> 15:25.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the replacement.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many other Republicans
who say,
no, we have to do it in this
first year for

15:29.162 --> 15:30.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a couple of reasons.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One is the pressure on them.

15:31.864 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second is, they know, the first
year of the
new president is one of the only
times in

15:35.468 --> 15:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recent history that you can get
anything done.

15:37.336 --> 15:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
let's move on
to Trump's nominees.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's put forward almost all of
his nominees
for Cabinet positions.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats are obviously
going to have
to pick which fights they want
to have here.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who do you think?

15:49.615 --> 15:52.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who are you likely to see stand
out as a place
where the Democrats try to hold
their ground?

15:52.051 --> 15:56.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, they are going
to pick on
pretty much everybody, it looks
like, at this

15:56.355 --> 16:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point, with the Democratic
leadership saying,
we're going to picking eight
people and we're

16:00.092 --> 16:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to spend all of our time
and energy
poking at them.

16:03.763 --> 16:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, they don't have the votes
to deny his
Cabinet picks.

16:08.034 --> 16:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they can do is try to
slow-walk the process,
make it painful.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, is there some
sort of backlash
to that?

16:15.875 --> 16:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the American public going to
be interested
in seeing a food-fight on
Capitol Hill, when

16:19.478 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they said what we voted for was
to see the
American public -- or to see
Congress move

16:24.450 --> 16:25.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead?

16:25.918 --> 16:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American public is tired of
watching the
dysfunction in Washington.

16:27.687 --> 16:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, you have got a
bunch of
Democrats who no longer have any
leadership

16:32.792 --> 16:33.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

16:33.793 --> 16:34.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

16:34.794 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't control the House or
Congress.

16:35.795 --> 16:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They're in the
wilderness.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're totally in the
wilderness without
an obvious leader.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to have something to
cling to and
to give to their base to fire
them up and

16:42.835 --> 16:43.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep them motivated.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:45.571 --> 16:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: These fights could
definitely
-- they could be very good for
the base.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They could make the base feel
good.

16:50.142 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have somebody like a Steven
Mnuchin for
Treasury, who headed a bank,
helped take over

16:57.850 --> 17:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bank that had failed, and that
bank ultimately
foreclosed on thousands of
homes.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lots of banks were foreclosing
on thousands
of people's homes.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right.

17:09.295 --> 17:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: But you have the
potential for
Senate Democrats to bring out
people who lost

17:14.300 --> 17:18.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their homes because of that bank
that he headed.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can make it very painful.

17:20.039 --> 17:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can -- they can use this --
Democrats
can use this to try to poke some
holes in

17:25.211 --> 17:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the idea of a Donald Trump as
populist.

17:28.614 --> 17:34.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's why also they are
particularly interested
in these very, very wealthy
people that Trump

17:34.887 --> 17:36.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has nominated for positions like
Commerce.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: His Cabinet of
billionaires.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, William,
the Democrats
are pushing especially hard to
try and get

17:40.326 --> 17:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax returns for all of these
nominees.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are probably not going to
get them.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not a requirement.

17:45.197 --> 17:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it wasn't required of the
Obama nominees,
Republicans like to point out.

17:48.334 --> 17:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Democrats are holding these
nominees to
a higher standard than the Obama
nominees,

17:52.672 --> 17:54.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they say, but these are
billionaires.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have complicated financial
dealings.

17:56.509 --> 18:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rex Tillerson, nominee for
secretary of state,
we want to know his exact
relationship with

18:00.980 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, like Amy is
saying, how much
do you -- how much do they go
out there -- how

18:06.018 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many of these battles do they
pick?

18:07.787 --> 18:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do they lose with the
public as a new
president with sort of a wind at
his back

18:11.324 --> 18:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is coming in by choosing right
now eight of
these battles?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But you don't
think really
that no one is going to get
derailed?

18:16.662 --> 18:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: No, it doesn't
sound like
it.

18:18.664 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Price, the HHS nominee and
current member
of Congress, is someone to
watch, because

18:23.502 --> 18:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal and
others have reported
that he invested in health care
stocks while

18:27.239 --> 18:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was writing health care law.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's something to watch.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But other than that...

18:31.744 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But I think that
Lisa raises a
really good point, which is,
there is always

18:34.513 --> 18:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that is unexpected,
surprises, if
we can recall 1992 and the
so-called nanny

18:40.353 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problem that...

18:41.520 --> 18:42.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:42.755 --> 18:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There was an
outbreak of nanny
problems.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: There were outbreaks
of nanny
problems.

18:46.292 --> 18:51.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And remember this was a
president-elect who
wasn't necessarily expecting to
win, and people

18:51.397 --> 18:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around him not necessarily
expecting it.

18:53.399 --> 18:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these people have been
moved very
quickly through this process.

18:56.936 --> 19:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe not a whole lot of vetting
had been
done early enough, and when the
vetting comes

19:01.040 --> 19:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out in public, it is a lot
messier.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a
question.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things that Trump
talked about soon after the
election was he

19:07.680 --> 19:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted to put forward a big
infrastructure
spending plan.

19:10.783 --> 19:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama tried the
same thing right
after he was elected, and the
GOP had no appetite

19:15.788 --> 19:17.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for it at the time.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think, Tam, that there is
going to
be a change of heart now, now
that it's Trump

19:20.626 --> 19:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the driver's seat and he
wants to spend
a lot of money?

19:22.928 --> 19:23.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are they interested?

19:23.929 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Not necessarily.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because Donald Trump
campaigned on it
doesn't mean that he's going to
get open arms

19:29.668 --> 19:31.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Congress.

19:31.070 --> 19:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even Mitch McConnell has
said, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:35.107 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, this is not a
front-burner issue
for a lot of Republicans in
Congress.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's sort of a back burner.

19:43.449 --> 19:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's not the thing that
is going to
be pushed through quickly,
because it is big

19:48.988 --> 19:50.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government spending.

19:50.890 --> 19:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, there is an
argument that could
be made that the stimulus that
President Obama

19:56.228 --> 20:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushed through was very large,
very hard to
communicate to the public.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A lot of people didn't
understand it, thought
their taxes were going up, when
they were

20:03.803 --> 20:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually being cut, and that
that was an albatross
around him that lasted
throughout his presidency,

20:10.342 --> 20:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that even though it actually
created jobs,
it ultimately set up the
Republicans to sort

20:17.950 --> 20:21.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of be oppositional from the
beginning, that
maybe he overreached.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there is not a lot of
appetite.

20:23.989 --> 20:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A quick note on
that, something
I'm watching for, is I wonder,
because what

20:26.859 --> 20:30.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is front burner for Republicans
in Congress
is they have been -- it's almost
like the

20:30.563 --> 20:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turkey has been on the table and
they just
couldn't carve it for years --
is tax reform.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They have felt
so close to
tax reform, and it just hasn't
happened.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They think it can happen.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are dying to do it.

20:41.173 --> 20:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a possibility that
perhaps we
see some sort of tax credit
incentive that

20:45.111 --> 20:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helps build infrastructure,
rather than a
classic stimulus plan, at least
to start.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We will watch.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And think back to
where President
Obama was at this point when he
was coming

20:55.621 --> 20:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, a lot of expectations about
what he was
able to do.

20:59.425 --> 21:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eight years later, really, you
look back,
to Lisa's point, he was able to
get most of

21:03.362 --> 21:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it done, almost -- any of it
done in his first
two years.

21:07.867 --> 21:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even then, he spent the last
four years
defending it.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trying to push through more than
one or two
things is really, really
difficult.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will be lucky if they get
-- and I think
the priority, from what I'm
hearing from folks

21:19.778 --> 21:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Hill, is pretty much
simple.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's taxes and it's Obamacare.

21:23.349 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What will be interesting, what
we're not hearing
about is something that Donald
Trump talked

21:26.585 --> 21:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot about, whether it's
infrastructure or
building that wall.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are two things that you're
not hearing
about in Congress.

21:32.658 --> 21:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Tam, Amy, Lisa,
thank you all very much for
being here.

TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The election
proved the
United States is more divided
than ever, rich

21:41.600 --> 21:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from poor, rural citizens from
urban dwellers.

21:44.737 --> 21:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has the American elite become
isolated from
the rest of society?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you, yourself, live in a
bubble?

21:50.442 --> 21:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the question we asked in
2016 in our
online quiz created for
"NewsHour" by conservative

21:55.281 --> 21:56.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thinker Charles Murray.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had hundreds of thousands of
responses.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Murray just finished
crunching the data.

22:01.487 --> 22:08.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
See what he found out on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

22:08.260 --> 22:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stay with us.

22:14.667 --> 22:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
preserving history
and literature in the digital
age; and prosecuting

22:21.674 --> 22:26.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Rwandan genocide, one
couple's mission
to track down perpetrators of
the massacres.

22:26.879 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we begin our series
on the legacy
of President Obama's time in
office.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our series is called The Obama
Years.

22:34.420 --> 22:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over the next two weeks, we
will examine
the successes, review his
administration's

22:39.124 --> 22:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failures, and highlight the
battles that will
continue during president-elect
Trump's tenure.

22:43.696 --> 22:50.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we start with President
Obama's legacy
on conservation.

22:50.069 --> 22:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his eight years in office,
President Obama
has permanently banned oil and
gas drilling

22:54.607 --> 23:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on hundreds of millions of acres
of federally
owned land in the Arctic and
Atlantic oceans.

23:00.045 --> 23:04.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's canceled oil and gas leases
on land owned
by the Blackfeet Nation in
Montana.

23:04.850 --> 23:09.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also used his executive
power 29 times
to create new national
monuments, protecting

23:09.822 --> 23:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 553 million acres of
water and land.

23:13.926 --> 23:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's more than the last 18
presidents combined.

23:17.963 --> 23:22.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In August, he more than
quadrupled the existing
marine national monument in the
Pacific Ocean

23:22.568 --> 23:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near Hawaii, creating the
largest protected
area on Earth.

23:26.005 --> 23:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Nature is actually resilient, if
we take care

23:32.011 --> 23:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to just stop actively destroying
it.

23:36.215 --> 23:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last week, the
president
set aside two new national
monuments, Bears

23:41.487 --> 23:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ears National Monument in Utah
and Gold Butte
National Monument in Nevada.

23:46.892 --> 23:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Environmentalists and Native
American groups
love the move, but critics have
called it

23:50.429 --> 23:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an egregious and arrogant
federal land grab.

23:54.133 --> 23:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With a new Republican Congress
and administration
coming in just a few weeks,
there are questions

23:58.737 --> 24:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about whether these efforts
might be rolled
back.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, I talked with The
Washington Post's
Juliet Eilperin about Obama's
legacy.

24:05.811 --> 24:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking her about
the significance
of these two most recent
monuments.

24:09.982 --> 24:13.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN, The Washington
Post: They're
both, for slightly different
reasons.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gold Butte is an area.

24:16.155 --> 24:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's roughly 300,000 acres, just
about an
hour's drive from Las Vegas.

24:22.528 --> 24:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's got incredible
petrified sand dunes,
rock art.

24:28.033 --> 24:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very important habitat
for the imperiled
desert tortoise.

24:33.038 --> 24:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while it's this area where
people go to
hike and enjoy, it's also right
at the heart

24:38.477 --> 24:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of where Cliven Bundy and his
family live.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a family that's been at
odds with
the federal government for
years.

24:44.416 --> 24:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is the
family that
was involved in the standoff in
2014 in Nevada

24:48.520 --> 24:50.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then the other in Oregon.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Exactly, and
then also the
occupation of the Malheur
National Wildlife

24:52.558 --> 24:54.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Refuge in Oregon.

24:54.360 --> 25:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they have failed to
recognize federal
authority for over -- well over
a decade.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been illegally grazing
there.

25:02.034 --> 25:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so their property is right
adjacent to
this area that was declared a
national monument.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's quite an interesting
area for that
reason.

25:12.378 --> 25:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bears Ears, in southeastern
Utah, which is
a larger parcel of land we're
talking about,

25:17.750 --> 25:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1.35 million acres, is an
incredibly important
ancestral Pueblo site.

25:24.423 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And so...

25:25.424 --> 25:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A Native
American site.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: So, it's a
Native American
site where there are many
tribes, some of

25:29.595 --> 25:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whom live near there and some of
whom have
actually moved to other areas,
who consider

25:33.999 --> 25:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it an incredibly important and
significant
place.

25:37.603 --> 25:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People still go there to collect
firewood
and collect herbs for
ceremonies.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see it -- it has been a
literal refuge
over the years, as well as
obviously kind

25:46.912 --> 25:48.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a spiritual refuge.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that's very important.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there are real divisions
there.

25:52.484 --> 25:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While a lot of people think it
should be protected,
there are real questions about,
again, the

25:56.188 --> 25:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
role of the federal government.

25:58.190 --> 26:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, these both
are considered
two of the more controversial of
Obama's designations,

26:02.161 --> 26:03.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Absolutely.

26:04.930 --> 26:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, he spent many years
doing ones
that -- where there was broad
consensus on

26:09.101 --> 26:11.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ground, where there was very
little controversy.

26:11.303 --> 26:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen, as he gets
towards the end
of his term, he's been making
slightly riskier

26:15.874 --> 26:17.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
designations.

26:17.876 --> 26:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With regards
to the criticism,
particularly in Utah, there was
a lot of blowback

26:21.914 --> 26:23.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

26:23.715 --> 26:26.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Orrin Hatch, both of the
senators, it seems
like every elected official in
Utah was against

26:26.852 --> 26:27.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

26:27.853 --> 26:29.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIET EILPERIN: Right.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What about the
criticisms
that they have?

26:30.255 --> 26:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are they arguing that Obama
shouldn't
have done?

26:32.090 --> 26:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: What they were
arguing wasn't
that this area didn't deserve
protection,

26:36.862 --> 26:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that they felt that the
president shouldn't
do it unilaterally.

26:40.766 --> 26:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers there had been working
for over
three years to draft legislation
that would

26:45.771 --> 26:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have included that area, as with
well as six
other counties, where they were
trying to

26:50.309 --> 26:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do a mix of development and
protection, give
some lands to the state that
they could use,

26:55.747 --> 26:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some lands would go to the
federal government.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they were looking for a
broader land
compromise.

27:01.553 --> 27:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That bill stalled in the House
and didn't
pass, and that's why the White
House argued

27:06.525 --> 27:09.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it had the right to, at this
point, move on
its own.

27:09.228 --> 27:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Obama used this
fairly old act, the Antiquities
Act, to designate

27:14.399 --> 27:15.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
these.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are these on pretty good legal
footing going
forward?

27:17.736 --> 27:19.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIET EILPERIN: Yes.

27:19.505 --> 27:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that's really
interesting
about this act that dates back
to 1906 is

27:22.808 --> 27:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it's fairly broadly worded
and that you
have had presidents from both
parties use

27:28.847 --> 27:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it frequently and to protect
areas.

27:32.518 --> 27:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when -- usually, it has
stood up to challenges
in court, that basically the
presidents are

27:38.657 --> 27:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given broad latitude to exercise
the authority.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, is there
any sense,
though, that if the Trump
administration comes

27:44.963 --> 27:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in -- and there's a lot of very
pro-drilling
interests in the potential
Cabinet of the

27:51.336 --> 27:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump administration -- is there
any way that
they could carve these back?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: They could.

27:56.475 --> 28:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one thing that would be very
straightforward,
where there is really no legal
controversy,

28:00.646 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that Congress could pass a
bill reversing
these moves.

28:05.083 --> 28:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if the president signed it,
that would
effectively end -- kill off the
monuments.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that could be done.

28:11.623 --> 28:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Republicans are asking
President Trump
to do is do it on his own.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That has never been done.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Presidents have on occasion
altered the boundaries.

28:20.165 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one case, Woodrow Wilson cut
a monument
that Teddy Roosevelt created in
half.

28:25.938 --> 28:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is kind of no court
precedent for
what would happen if a president
on his own

28:32.444 --> 28:34.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reversed it.

28:34.246 --> 28:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a legal opinion dating
to 1938 which
says the president can't do it,
but that's

28:37.916 --> 28:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not been tested in court.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: More broadly,
how do you
see these particular
designations fitting

28:42.888 --> 28:45.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into Obama's overall
conservation legacy?

28:45.457 --> 28:49.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: I think they
are very interesting
and significant for a couple of
reasons.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is that the president
has tried
to broaden the definition of
what is American

28:53.899 --> 28:55.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
history and what is our
heritage.

28:55.767 --> 29:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he really has focused on
recognizing
areas that, for example,
recognize everything

29:01.440 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from black history, to LGBT
history, women's
history, and Native American
history.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In designating
national
parks?

29:10.649 --> 29:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Yes, and
highlighting it
as part of the Park Service.

29:13.785 --> 29:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these two are a mix, but,
primarily, they're
a land management land, but
basically trying

29:18.290 --> 29:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say, this is all of our
history and this
is part of what it means to be
American.

29:21.793 --> 29:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, in many ways, that's what's
most important.

29:24.429 --> 29:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other senses, it does connect
to his more
-- his legacy, because he's
talked about climate

29:29.868 --> 29:31.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

29:31.737 --> 29:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they were describing this
monument, White
House officials talked about,
this will create

29:34.840 --> 29:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resiliency to climate impacts,
corridors for
wildlife.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there are other reasons why
it matters.

29:39.811 --> 29:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's really come to focus
more on public
lands and public waters in his
second term.

29:44.916 --> 29:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While he's done climate change
from the beginning,
this was not as much of a
priority in his

29:48.453 --> 29:50.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first term.

29:50.155 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know that
not all conservationists
think that Obama gets an A-plus.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you think his legacy is
going to be
measured by history?

29:57.329 --> 29:59.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIET EILPERIN: Right.

29:59.264 --> 30:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, on one level, we
certainly do need
to see whether things get
reversed over time.

30:02.768 --> 30:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that applies whether you're
talking about
some of his climate policies
regarding power

30:06.672 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plants, or whether you're
talking about this.

30:08.440 --> 30:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is no question
that he is one
of the most consequential
presidents when

30:13.845 --> 30:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it comes to the environment.

30:15.614 --> 30:20.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has really made it a
centerpiece of his
domestic policy and even his
foreign policy.

30:20.352 --> 30:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that, when people
look back,
they will see that he really
focused on this

30:27.192 --> 30:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intently, particularly as he saw
his term
coming to a close.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is only
a couple more
weeks left.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you think he's done
designating lands?

30:34.066 --> 30:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: I don't think
he's done yet.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a few different ones
they're looking
at.

30:37.335 --> 30:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're looking at expanding a
couple existing
monuments that were created
earlier, including

30:41.673 --> 30:47.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the California Coastal National
Monument,
as well as the Cascade-Siskiyou
Monument in

30:47.446 --> 30:49.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oregon.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are certainly, if I
had to lay bets
there, a couple of historic
monuments they're

30:52.718 --> 30:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at, including one that
would highlight
civil rights history in -- two
in Alabama

30:58.590 --> 31:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would speak to that.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also a long-shot one in
South Carolina
addressing Reconstruction.

31:03.462 --> 31:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Juliet Eilperin
of The Washington Post, thank
you so much.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Thanks so much,
William.

31:09.034 --> 31:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tomorrow, our
series The
Obama Years continues with a
review of the

31:13.038 --> 31:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president's education policies.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now, watch
a book conversation about the
history of our

31:18.710 --> 31:20.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
national parks.

31:20.479 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, meet a man who planned to
visit all
59 parks in 59 weeks to
celebrate the 100th

31:26.284 --> 31:29.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anniversary of the National Park
Service last
year.

31:29.087 --> 31:39.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more is at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

31:39.131 --> 31:44.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more is at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

31:44.236 --> 31:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The discovery of mass graves or
other evidence
of war crimes poses several
challenges, chief

31:49.174 --> 31:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among them, bringing the alleged
war criminals
to court.

31:52.544 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to former United
States Justice
Department official Allan Ryan,
the recent

31:56.181 --> 32:00.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
introduction of what's known as
universal
jurisdiction has made it easier
to prosecute

32:01.019 --> 32:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these suspected war criminals.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLAN RYAN, Former U.S. Justice
Department
Official: Universal jurisdiction
is not a

32:05.056 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
universal concept yet.

32:06.424 --> 32:12.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allows trials to be held
where otherwise
they might not be.

32:12.430 --> 32:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In France,
universal jurisdiction
has made it possible for a
husband and wife

32:16.968 --> 32:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pursue alleged war criminals
behind the
1994 Rwandan genocide.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jonathan
Silvers has
that story.

32:24.943 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: For the past
15 years, Dafroza
Gauthier has risen at first
light to probe

32:30.182 --> 32:35.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Rwandan genocide and track
down fugitive
perpetrators, notably the
slaughter's architects

32:35.687 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and executioners.

32:38.223 --> 32:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gauthier was born and raised in
Rwanda and,
until recently, worked in the
chemical industry.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she has become a formidable
war crimes
investigator, by necessity.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAFROZA GAUTHIER, War Crimes
Investigator
(through translator): We began
by collecting

32:50.969 --> 32:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information and testimony from
our close friends
and families.

32:53.672 --> 32:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the more we heard their
stories, the more
we knew that something had to be
done.

32:57.876 --> 33:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: Dafroza
Gauthier has only
one memento of her family, this
photo of her

33:03.481 --> 33:07.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother, who was murdered along
with scores
of relatives in the spring of
1994.

33:07.986 --> 33:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gauthier was living in Belgium
when the genocide
began, and she learned about her
family members'

33:12.724 --> 33:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demise in real time, via a
series of phone
calls to her native village in
Rwanda.

33:18.830 --> 33:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The violence was rooted in
longstanding ethnic
division between the governing
Hutu majority

33:23.902 --> 33:25.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the Tutsi minority.

33:25.704 --> 33:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the space of 100 days,
roughly 800,000
men, women, and children were
killed, mostly

33:31.142 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutus.

33:33.245 --> 33:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAFROZA GAUTHIER (through
translator): One
day, people should ask the
question why the

33:37.515 --> 33:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world abandoned the Tutsis in
Rwanda.

33:39.651 --> 33:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are nation, states,
politicians who
should ask forgiveness of the
Rwandan people.

33:44.055 --> 33:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: To date,
Gauthier and her
associates have tracked down
roughly 30 fugitive

33:48.326 --> 33:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perpetrators of the genocide in
France and
its territories.

33:52.564 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The dossiers on these
perpetrators, known
here in France as genocidaires,
grow larger

33:57.602 --> 33:59.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the week.

33:59.271 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAFROZA GAUTHIER (through
translator): One
case can take two, three or four
years by

34:04.209 --> 34:06.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the time we collect the
evidence.

34:06.244 --> 34:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what has to be denounced
today is why
is the public prosecutor is not
investigating.

34:11.182 --> 34:15.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why is the public prosecutor
waiting for civil
plaintiffs like us to find the
evidence?

34:15.887 --> 34:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The public prosecutor should do
its job of
justice.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It shouldn't be our job.

34:20.425 --> 34:26.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN SILVERS: The
investigative work is
a partnership, consecrated by 37
years of

34:26.264 --> 34:28.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marriage.

34:28.099 --> 34:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alain Gauthier met Dafroza in
Rwanda, where
Alain taught French in a foreign
aid program.

34:33.104 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A native Frenchman and retired
high school
principal, he's learned to
navigate the bureaucracy

34:38.877 --> 34:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is the French legal system.

34:40.879 --> 34:46.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Together, he and wife
established an organization,
the Civil Parties Collective for
Rwanda, to

34:46.718 --> 34:49.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
secure legal status as
plaintiffs in civil
suits.

34:49.955 --> 34:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAIN GAUTHIER, War Crimes
Investigator (through
translator): We were forced to
investigate

34:52.991 --> 34:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ourselves, because the public
prosecutor never
pressed charges.

34:56.461 --> 35:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the cases concerning the
murder of Tutsis
in Rwanda came solely through
the will of

35:00.298 --> 35:02.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the plaintiffs.

35:02.167 --> 35:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: After years of
legal wrangling,
a senior figure in the Rwandan
genocide faced

35:06.471 --> 35:11.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
French justice for the first
time in February
2014.

35:11.209 --> 35:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Gauthiers have filed a civil
action that
led the justice ministry to
prosecute the

35:15.880 --> 35:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
defendant, Pascal Simbikangwa.

35:19.985 --> 35:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simbikangwa held a senior
position in the
Rwandan state security service
in the 1990s.

35:24.756 --> 35:29.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite being paralyzed from the
waste down
during the genocide, he helped
arm the Hutu

35:29.094 --> 35:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
militia and organized roadblocks
where thousands
of fleeing Tutsi were murdered.

35:34.332 --> 35:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Gauthiers found him living
under an assumed
name in the French territory of
Mayotte in

35:39.004 --> 35:40.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Indian Ocean.

35:40.638 --> 35:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd fled there after the
genocide and survived
by forging identity documents.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French authorities arrested him
in 2008.

35:47.545 --> 35:52.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALAIN GAUTHIER (through
translator): In some
cases, we had to travel three,
four or five

35:52.951 --> 35:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
times to Rwanda to take as much
testimony
as possible.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then, all that testimony had to
be translated.

35:58.990 --> 36:03.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The testimony has to be
organized and given
to our lawyers to draft a
complaint.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every case requires a large
amount of work.

36:05.497 --> 36:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's hard for plaintiffs like
us, who are
not trained for this type of
work.

36:09.501 --> 36:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: The Gauthiers'
pursuit of
fugitive perpetrators has forced
France to

36:15.040 --> 36:18.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
examine its conduct both during
and after
the genocide.

36:18.910 --> 36:23.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France had close relations with
the Hutu-led
regime that carried out the
slaughter.

36:23.481 --> 36:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the aftermath, Rwanda's
post-genocide government
has accused France of
complicity, obstructing

36:28.620 --> 36:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the escape of Hutu killers, and
harboring
fugitives.

36:32.257 --> 36:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most recently, the European
Human Rights Court
condemned France for excessive
delays in investigating

36:37.328 --> 36:39.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suspected genocidaires.

36:39.597 --> 36:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Preliminary investigations
against one suspect
took nine years to reach court.

36:44.369 --> 36:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These chronic delays outraged
Rwandan survivors
in France, like Marcel Kabanda,
a historian

36:49.774 --> 36:52.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
specializing in genocide
studies.

36:52.177 --> 36:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCEL KABANDA, Historian
(through translator):
For 20 years, we asked ourselves
if France

36:58.850 --> 37:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't becoming a paradise for
Rwandan war
criminals.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France must not be the country
that gives
impunity to the killers behind
the genocide.

37:06.891 --> 37:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: The effort to
bring Rwanda
genocidaires to justice was
bolstered in 2010

37:14.099 --> 37:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a modification to the French
penal code
permitting the prosecution of
major crimes

37:19.003 --> 37:20.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
committed outside France.

37:21.005 --> 37:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This type of prosecution is
better known as
universal jurisdiction,
according to Allan

37:25.543 --> 37:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan, the U.S. government's
former chief war
crimes prosecutor.

37:29.447 --> 37:36.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALLAN RYAN: Universal
jurisdiction is a concept
and in some countries a law that
says, this

37:36.387 --> 37:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country will have jurisdiction
over genocide,
war crimes, crimes against
humanity, no matter

37:44.829 --> 37:49.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where in the world they might
have taken place,
no matter where in the world or
in the world

37:49.567 --> 37:51.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they might have involved.

37:51.636 --> 37:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a departure from what
international jurisdiction
has been from the beginning of
the international

37:57.475 --> 38:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system 350 years ago that says
there has to
be some connection between the
country and

38:04.616 --> 38:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the trial, the victims have to
be your citizens,
or the venue of the trial has to
be where

38:10.989 --> 38:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crime took place, or in some
way there
has to be a tie between the
country and the

38:16.895 --> 38:18.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crime.

38:18.763 --> 38:22.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN SILVERS: Pascal
Simbikangwa was the
first Rwandan prosecuted for
genocide in France

38:22.600 --> 38:25.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
under the new universal
jurisdiction law.

38:25.537 --> 38:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The landmark trial attracted
legions of survivors
and their supporters.

38:30.074 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Throughout the trial and
appellate process,
the defendant maintained his
innocence.

38:35.113 --> 38:39.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the defendant's public
advocate, Fabrice
Epstein crafted a defense based
on reasonable

38:39.784 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doubt, emphasizing the 20-year
interval between
the alleged crime and the French
trial.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FABRICE EPSTEIN, Attorney for
Pascal Simbikangwa:
This is, for me, an act of
courage to say

38:47.325 --> 38:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that I believe this person.

38:48.927 --> 38:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe that, when there's a
genocide, there
could be innocent people.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This one is, so I will defend
him.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: The case has
particular
significance for Epstein.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's Jewish and the grandson of
a Holocaust
survivor.

39:02.140 --> 39:07.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FABRICE EPSTEIN: I spoke with
the client about
my origins, about my family, of
course.

39:07.445 --> 39:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he knows that it's really
important for
me that he doesn't lie, because,
when we're

39:13.184 --> 39:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about genocide, it's
something really
deep.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It reminds me what my people
went through.

39:19.490 --> 39:25.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: The first
trial ended in
2014 with Simbikangwa's
conviction for genocide

39:25.063 --> 39:27.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and complicity in crimes against
humanity.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The appellate court upheld the
conviction.

39:31.135 --> 39:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Simbikangwa will now serve a
25-year prison
sentence.

39:34.839 --> 39:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Following the Simbikangwa trial,
two more
Rwandan fugitives located by the
Gauthiers

39:39.744 --> 39:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been prosecuted in France.

39:41.946 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Both were convicted and
sentenced to life
imprisonment.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These legal victories have
energized the Gauthiers.

39:48.853 --> 39:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They now devote all of their
time to tracking
down fugitive genocidaires and
filing new

39:53.091 --> 39:55.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cases with the court system.

39:55.126 --> 39:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A small amount of funding
provided by the
state and their supporters has
proven inadequate,

39:59.230 --> 40:03.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they have depleted their own
savings to
continue this work.

40:03.334 --> 40:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAFROZA GAUTHIER (through
translator): Is
justice possible?

40:08.339 --> 40:09.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

40:09.340 --> 40:12.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, like mankind, it's not
perfect.

40:12.744 --> 40:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We accept it so we can continue
our work for
everyone, for future
generations, for victims,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and even for the executioners.

40:22.020 --> 40:26.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN SILVERS: Reporting from
France, this
is Jonathan Silvers for the "PBS
NewsHour."

40:26.758 --> 40:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jonathan
Silvers is the
producer and director of "Dead
Reckoning,"

40:31.362 --> 40:41.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a PBS documentary series on
postwar justice
that's premiering on March 28.

40:41.406 --> 40:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a PBS documentary series on
postwar justice
that's premiering on March 28.

40:52.483 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're increasingly cataloging
our lives online,
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
seemingly endless

40:58.122 --> 40:59.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
YouTube videos.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a digital-first and often
digital-only
world.

41:02.360 --> 41:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The advantages of this unlimited
digital storage
seem obvious, but how permanent
are some of

41:08.099 --> 41:09.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those records?

41:09.133 --> 41:11.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do we preserve digital
history?

41:11.569 --> 41:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story,
part of our ongoing
series Culture at Risk.

41:15.006 --> 41:19.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this is like
an ancient
temple come to life in a modern
age.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BREWSTER KAHLE, Founder,
Internet Archive:
In a modern day.

41:21.879 --> 41:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a Greek-style building,
which we loved,
because the whole idea is the
Library of Alexandria

41:27.852 --> 41:29.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reborn now.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's an ancient
idea: to gather
and preserve the world's
knowledge.

41:33.424 --> 41:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now that library will look
like this.

41:37.428 --> 41:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These stacks of servers,
Brewster Kahle told
me recently, represent a 20-year
and running

41:42.266 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort to build a kind of
digital library,
and to essentially back up the
ever-expanding

41:48.106 --> 41:49.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
World Wide Web.

41:49.774 --> 41:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: In one of these
would be 100
years of a channel of
television.

41:53.978 --> 42:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or this much is all of the words
in the Library
of Congress.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to be able to preserve
our digital
history.

42:03.020 --> 42:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kahle was an
early Internet
entrepreneur who in 1996 founded
the Internet

42:08.659 --> 42:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Archive, a nonprofit that
operates out of
an old Christian Science church
in San Francisco.

42:14.599 --> 42:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was designed to address a
fundamental flaw
in the original creation of the
World Wide

42:19.804 --> 42:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: The wonder of it
is, it's
very, very simple.

42:26.444 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anybody could go and set up a
web server on
their computer and make it
available to the

42:30.882 --> 42:31.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, it's too simple.

42:33.684 --> 42:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's fragile, that if something
happens to
that piece of equipment, that
Web site just,

42:38.122 --> 42:39.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
blink, is gone.

42:39.357 --> 42:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: If it's online,
it lives forever,
right?

42:42.427 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, no.

42:43.728 --> 42:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kahle says the average lifespan
of a Web page
is just 92 days.

42:50.301 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Information is altered and
deleted all the
time for all kinds of reasons.

42:54.939 --> 43:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 2013 Harvard study, for
example, found that
half the hyperlinks in Supreme
Court cases,

43:01.879 --> 43:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today's equivalent of footnotes,
are broken,
a phenomena known as link rot.

43:08.586 --> 43:13.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government agencies remove
documents, and
companies fail, and with them
the sites they

43:13.191 --> 43:14.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
host.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Think of GeoCities, Yahoo!

43:16.160 --> 43:18.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Video, and, more recently, the
news site Gawker.

ABBY SMITH RUMSEY, Author, "When
We Are No
More: How Digital Memory Is
Shaping Our Future":

43:20.731 --> 43:24.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People mistake the fact that the
Internet
is ubiquitous with the fact that
it's permanent.

43:24.602 --> 43:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Abby Smith Rumsey
is the author
of "When We Are No More: How
Digital Memory

43:29.807 --> 43:31.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is Shaping Our Future."

43:31.809 --> 43:37.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She began her scholarly career
studying how
information was purposely
deleted in the totalitarian

43:37.582 --> 43:39.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Soviet system.

43:39.617 --> 43:43.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These days, she thinks, we have
a new kind
of storage and retrieval
problem.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: It isn't
permanent at all.

43:45.556 --> 43:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the thing about
digital technology
is, you can inscribe something
onto a computer,

43:51.462 --> 43:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but you can't put it on a shelf
and expect
to pick it out at random at 50,
let alone

43:56.334 --> 43:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
500, years, and be able to read
it.

43:58.769 --> 44:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, you won't have the
hardware or the
software to do that.

44:01.706 --> 44:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's very fragile, indeed.

44:03.508 --> 44:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And while there
might be plenty
online not worth saving, Rumsey
sees much

44:08.012 --> 44:09.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
higher stakes.

44:09.814 --> 44:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: I think we're
losing obviously
the past, but by saying that
we're losing

44:14.785 --> 44:19.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past, the record of the
past, we're saying
that, in a sense, we're losing
our own memory

44:19.156 --> 44:21.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and sense of who we are.

44:21.959 --> 44:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Brewster Kahle's
answer?

44:26.764 --> 44:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wayback Machine, fancifully
named for
a feature on the old "Rocky and
Bullwinkle

44:35.506 --> 44:37.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Show."

44:37.275 --> 44:42.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There, a genius dog named Mr.
Peabody took
his adopted boy, Sherman, back
in time to

44:42.380 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better understand key historical
events.

44:44.949 --> 44:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK GRAHAM, Director, The
Wayback Machine:
We have been collecting captures
of the public

44:51.122 --> 44:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Web for the last 20 years.

44:52.957 --> 44:57.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mark Graham,
director of the
new Wayback Machine, says it's
already saved

44:57.662 --> 45:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 500 billion Web
captures in its
20-year history.

45:01.832 --> 45:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK GRAHAM: We have software
that's referred
to as crawlers or spiders that
go out and

45:07.705 --> 45:12.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to individual Web pages, look
at those
Web pages, look at all of the
links on those

45:12.843 --> 45:18.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pages and then go to those
pages, look at
all the links on those pages,
and then goes

45:18.849 --> 45:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to those pages, et cetera, et
cetera.

45:20.651 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, kind of like a spider
crawling on the
Web, the software goes out and
discovers what's

45:27.525 --> 45:29.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
available.

45:29.360 --> 45:32.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Users can then
visit Web pages
at different points in their
history, seeing

45:32.763 --> 45:35.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how they looked before they were
altered or
deleted.

45:35.266 --> 45:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK GRAHAM: We're a library,
and so we don't
really try to like figure out
what it is people

45:41.305 --> 45:43.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
may want.

45:43.074 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just want to have as much as
we can of
what's available, because we
know that people

45:48.579 --> 45:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are probably going to want these
things.

45:50.381 --> 45:54.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Exactly what the
archive saves
is determined by popularity, the
number of

45:54.785 --> 46:01.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
references or links to that
page, and by some
1,000 librarians and experts
around the globe

46:01.926 --> 46:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working in concert with the
Internet Archive.

46:05.129 --> 46:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Case in point, in July 2014,
Russian-backed
rebels claimed to have shot down
a military

46:11.535 --> 46:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plane over Ukraine, until it
became clear
the jet was a passenger
airliner, with 283

46:18.609 --> 46:20.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people killed.

46:20.444 --> 46:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK GRAHAM: So, what we're
seeing here is
a capture, actually one out of
the 38 captures

46:24.482 --> 46:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a post made on a Russian
social media site
by a pro-Russian rebel who was
boasting about

46:31.522 --> 46:36.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting down a plane at the
same time that
MH-17 was shot down.

46:36.294 --> 46:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was removed within a
few hours after
it was posted.

46:39.664 --> 46:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as far as we know, these are
the only
captures of this Web page that
exist.

46:44.101 --> 46:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These kinds of
pages have in
some cases even been used as
evidence in courts.

46:49.273 --> 46:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Internet Archive's home is a
strange world:
several generations of media and
technology,

46:55.680 --> 47:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stained glass windows and church
pews, and
almost eerie rows of sculptures
of the many

47:00.751 --> 47:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who've worked on the
project.

47:03.354 --> 47:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its motto is universal access to
all knowledge,
and Kahle's aspirations could
hardly reach

47:09.560 --> 47:11.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
higher.

47:11.162 --> 47:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: The idea is to
build the Library
of Alexandria, version two.

47:14.065 --> 47:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could we make all the published
works of humankind,
books, music, video, Web pages,
software,

47:19.870 --> 47:25.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
available to anybody who wanted
to have access
to them anywhere in the world?

47:25.176 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Today, the
project is digitizing
films, books, video games,
software, even

47:39.990 --> 47:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
round-the-clock television news
channels.

47:46.530 --> 47:54.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The original Library of
Alexandria is thought
to date to around 295 B.C.

47:54.038 --> 47:58.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When and how it was destroyed is
still much
debated, but the loss of so much
of the classical

47:59.009 --> 48:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world's greatest works is beyond
debate.

48:01.612 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: The best thing
to learn from
the Library of Alexandria,
version one, is

48:05.249 --> 48:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't just have one copy.

48:07.551 --> 48:12.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we had had another copy in
India, or in
China, we'd have the other works
of Aristotle,

48:12.957 --> 48:14.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the other plays of Euripides.

48:14.558 --> 48:15.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we don't.

48:16.026 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not to mention so
many other
things that were just lost.

48:17.595 --> 48:18.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't even know what we don't
have.

48:18.763 --> 48:20.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: We don't even
know what they
were.

48:20.131 --> 48:21.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're just -- they're --
they're gone.

48:21.398 --> 48:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some people think it's --
say it's good
to forget.

48:23.534 --> 48:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sure there's good things
to forget,
but there's a lot that we should
have remembered

48:28.272 --> 48:29.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and kept alive.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's a lot
more to be done.

48:32.009 --> 48:37.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kahle and his group are teaming
with companies
like Mozilla and Wikipedia to
make preservation

48:37.715 --> 48:40.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Web pages more automatic.

48:40.217 --> 48:44.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're also working on ways to
make the Wayback
Machine more easily searchable.

48:44.722 --> 48:50.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, copyright reform
remains an
important ongoing question in
any attempt

48:50.528 --> 48:53.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to create a true global library.

48:53.597 --> 48:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Twenty years in, Kahle is
impatient.

48:56.066 --> 49:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: Why aren't all
of the books
in all of the libraries already
digital?

49:01.605 --> 49:03.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And why aren't
they?

49:03.474 --> 49:06.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BREWSTER KAHLE: I think it's
that institutions
don't know what roles they're
supposed to

49:07.011 --> 49:08.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
play going forward.

49:08.813 --> 49:12.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They knew what it was when they
were supposed
to buy books and put them on
shelves, but

49:12.249 --> 49:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now, do they do their own
digital services?

49:14.752 --> 49:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they wait for somebody else
to do it and
subscribe to it?

49:17.788 --> 49:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm hoping that, by at least
2020, all right,
so in three, four years from
now, we're not

49:22.693 --> 49:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about, wouldn't it be
great to build
a complete digital library of
the Library

49:26.430 --> 49:27.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Congress online?

49:27.431 --> 49:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We say, OK, that's done.

49:28.999 --> 49:30.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now what do we do?

49:30.401 --> 49:32.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do we go and make the next
better services?

49:32.503 --> 49:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do we make a global brain?

49:34.371 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How to we go and make it so that
Nobel scientists
are using these vast resources
to go and make

49:41.111 --> 49:42.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new discoveries?

49:42.613 --> 49:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we only have pieces now.

49:44.381 --> 49:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Billions of
pieces, with billions
more being collected all the
time.

49:49.854 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From San Francisco, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

49:59.430 --> 50:09.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now we turn to
our "NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

50:09.773 --> 50:11.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be of interest to you as
well.

50:11.942 --> 50:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When J'Nai Bridges' dream of
playing professional
sports suddenly fell apart, she
focused intently

50:16.914 --> 50:19.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on developing her singing voice.

50:19.083 --> 50:23.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now the mezzo-soprano is
performing major
roles for some of the world's
most renowned

50:23.921 --> 50:25.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opera companies.

50:25.656 --> 50:31.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She recently spoke with Claudia
Escobar and
Chloe Veltman of KQED in San
Francisco.

50:31.095 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
J'NAI BRIDGES, Singer: I fell in
love with
classical singing.

50:39.737 --> 50:45.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I like to say that opera
chose me, because
I didn't grow up listening to it
or going

50:45.976 --> 50:49.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the opera.

50:49.079 --> 50:56.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My basketball career ended kind
of dramatically,
and it was the same time that I
discovered

50:57.021 --> 50:57.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
singing.

50:58.022 --> 51:03.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it just opened up this whole
new world.

51:03.627 --> 51:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was in high school, my last
year in high
school, and I had to take an
elective, an

51:09.066 --> 51:10.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
arts elective.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I chose to be in the
choir.

51:11.502 --> 51:12.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I joined the choir.

51:12.670 --> 51:19.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my choir teacher, she
noticed that I had
a gift.

51:19.810 --> 51:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From having not grown up singing
classically,
I think most people would
probably -- just

51:29.386 --> 51:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't even give it a chance
or a thought.

51:32.990 --> 51:38.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my parents did everything
that they could
for us, and one of them being
that we just

51:38.162 --> 51:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stay open to whatever life
brings us.

51:42.299 --> 51:53.610 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
Channeling the
different emotions of these
characters is

51:53.644 --> 51:58.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot like channeling emotions
of myself.

51:58.182 --> 52:00.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Practice.

52:00.050 --> 52:09.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Practice, practice, practice,
because there
is a lot of luck, but when
opportunity meets

52:09.193 --> 52:12.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being prepared, that's what luck
is.

52:12.296 --> 52:18.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you just have to be
ready.

52:18.469 --> 52:22.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Music is so healing.

52:22.306 --> 52:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's this universal
language that,
that even if you don't
understand the language,

52:27.044 --> 52:31.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you don't really have a
background in music,
everyone can identify with it.

52:31.915 --> 52:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love the fact that I have this
gift to sing
and touch people.

52:41.959 --> 52:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love the fact that I have this
gift to sing
and touch people.

52:47.731 --> 52:50.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that's the
"NewsHour"
for tonight.

52:50.834 --> 52:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, Judy Woodruff
returns, and our
series The Obama Years
continues.

52:55.272 --> 53:00.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talk to CIA Director John
Brennan and review
President Obama's education
policies.

53:00.144 --> 53:02.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:02.713 --> 53:04.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

53:04.048 --> 53:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:14.158 --> 53:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
