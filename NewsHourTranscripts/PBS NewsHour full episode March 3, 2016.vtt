JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.808 --> 00:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Republicans stand
back as their presidential
nominee of four

00:13.046 --> 00:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago levels a blistering
attack on this
year's GOP front-runner, Donald
Trump.

00:20.354 --> 00:25.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Thursday:
fighting fire with
fire. Researchers turn to
mosquitoes as a

00:25.959 --> 00:27.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weapon against Zika.

00:27.794 --> 00:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA TEPEDINO, Oxitec: The
beauty of this
technique is that it can reach
the mosquitoes

00:32.266 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where no other technique can
find it. We are
using mosquitoes to fight
themselves.

00:35.903 --> 00:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, women on
Wall Street
-- the former managing director
of a New York

00:40.908 --> 00:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investment bank on the rampant
sexism she
and others endured.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY, Author, "Opening
Belle": If
women were walking by in a
skirt, he would

00:48.548 --> 00:51.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
throw himself on the floor,
pretend to look
up their skirt. And they would
-- he would

00:51.718 --> 00:54.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get the laugh, you know, from
the other guys.

00:54.521 --> 01:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:02.396 --> 01:05.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.198 --> 01:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of the
biggest names in
Republican politics took on
Donald Trump with

01:14.841 --> 01:16.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
growing fervor today.

01:16.643 --> 01:22.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Salt Lake City, Mitt Romney
injected himself
into the middle of the GOP race,
just ahead

01:22.349 --> 01:24.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of tonight's candidate debate.

01:24.184 --> 01:27.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
If we Republicans choose Donald
Trump as our

01:27.721 --> 01:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nominee, the prospects for a
safe and prosperous
future are greatly diminished.

01:33.226 --> 01:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With that, the
party's 2012
nominee for president joined the
campaign

01:38.598 --> 01:41.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stop Trump from becoming this
year's standard-bearer.

01:41.835 --> 01:47.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY: Dishonesty is
Donald Trump's
hallmark. He claimed that he had
spoken clearly

01:47.207 --> 01:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and boldly against going into
Iraq.

01:50.243 --> 01:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wrong. He spoke in favor of
invading Iraq.
He said he saw thousands of
Muslims in New

01:57.084 --> 01:59.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jersey celebrating 9/11.

01:59.953 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wrong. He saw no such thing. He
imagined it.
He's not of the temperament of
the kind of

02:07.828 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stable, thoughtful person we
need as a leader.
His imagination must not be
married to real

02:13.533 --> 02:15.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

02:15.268 --> 02:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Romney
charged, Trump
is a phony and fraud who's
taking advantage

02:20.007 --> 02:21.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the people who support him.

02:21.842 --> 02:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY: He's playing the
American public
for suckers. He gets a free ride
to the White

02:26.013 --> 02:28.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House and all we get is a lousy
hat.

02:28.448 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Romney started by
saying he
is not joining the race.
Instead, he said

02:34.021 --> 02:39.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he'd vote for whomever has the
best chance
of beating Trump. It was a stark
departure

02:39.459 --> 02:44.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from four years ago, when
candidate Romney
welcomed the billionaire's
backing.

02:44.364 --> 02:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITT ROMNEY: It means a great
deal to me to
have the endorsement of Mr.
Trump.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Within hours
today, Trump answered
at a campaign stop in Maine.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Look, Mitt is a failed
candidate. He failed.

02:58.612 --> 03:03.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I backed Mitt Romney. I backed
him. You can
see how loyal he is. He was
begging for my

03:04.017 --> 03:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorsement. I could have said,
Mitt, drop
to your knees. He would have
dropped to his

03:08.722 --> 03:10.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knees. He was begging.

03:10.557 --> 03:16.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The candidate
offered a lengthy
personal critique of Romney,
blasting his

03:16.196 --> 03:17.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
losing effort in 2012.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's a choke
artist. He's an
absolute -- and I started
hitting him so hard.

03:22.836 --> 03:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, people say, why did you
hit him so
hard? Because we cannot take
another loss.

03:26.973 --> 03:33.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't take another loss. And
Mitt is indeed
a choke artist. He choked, and
he choked like

03:33.213 --> 03:34.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have never seen anyone choke.

03:34.948 --> 03:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Other Republican
elders are
weighing in as well. Senator
John McCain,

03:39.419 --> 03:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party's 2008 nominee, said
in a statement:
"I would also echo the many
concerns about

03:45.559 --> 03:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's uninformed and
indeed dangerous
statements on national security
issues."

03:51.832 --> 03:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some 70-plus Republican
experts on foreign
policy issued a press release
pledging to

03:58.405 --> 04:03.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oppose the front-runner.

04:03.677 --> 04:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of Trump's former rivals
and newest
supporters, New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie,

04:09.749 --> 04:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dismissed the criticism. He
noted he's telling
Trump not to bolt the party if
he's denied

04:15.755 --> 04:17.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nomination.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), New
Jersey: I have
urged him not to do that,
because I don't

04:19.226 --> 04:22.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that's constructive -- a
constructive
way to go about it, and he knows
that.

04:22.529 --> 04:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this just
hours before
Trump and his remaining rivals,
Ted Cruz,

04:28.468 --> 04:34.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio and John Kasich,
face off again
in a FOX News debate in Detroit.

04:34.541 --> 04:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, on the Democratic
side, underdog
Bernie Sanders in Lansing,
Michigan, took

04:40.714 --> 04:44.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new aim today at Hillary Clinton
and her stance
on trade.

04:44.584 --> 04:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
She has supported NAFTA. I
opposed NAFTA.

04:49.990 --> 04:56.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She supported permanent normal
trade relations
with China. I vigorously opposed
PNTR with

04:56.396 --> 05:01.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China. She supported permanent
normal trade
relations with Vietnam. I
opposed that.

05:01.701 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton stayed
off the trail
today, but The Washington Post
reported a

05:06.807 --> 05:14.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
new turn in the FBI
investigation of her handling
of e-mail as secretary of state.
It said Bryan

05:14.848 --> 05:21.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pagliano, a former State
Department staffer
who set up her private server,
has been granted

05:21.588 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
federal immunity for his
cooperation.

05:25.058 --> 05:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has acknowledged that it
was a mistake
to use a private server, but has
insisted

05:30.130 --> 05:34.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nothing she received or sent was
classified
at the time.

05:34.467 --> 05:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will dig further into today's
Republican
fireworks after the news
summary.

05:40.140 --> 05:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, both
Apple and the
FBI picked up allies today in
their legal

05:45.278 --> 05:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight over encryption. There was
word that
Google, Facebook, and Microsoft
will oppose

05:50.650 --> 05:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts to make Apple unlock an
iPhone. It
was used by Syed Farook in the
mass shootings

05:56.756 --> 05:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in San Bernardino, California.

05:59.059 --> 06:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, relatives of
six of the
victims filed a brief supporting
the FBI's

06:04.931 --> 06:06.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

06:06.733 --> 06:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of Florida is ready to
reinstate
the death penalty. State
lawmakers voted today

06:11.304 --> 06:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to replace a law that the U.S.
Supreme Court
struck down in January. The old
law required

06:16.810 --> 06:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a simple majority of jurors to
recommend a
death sentence. The new one says
at least

06:22.649 --> 06:25.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10 of the 12 jurors must agree.

06:25.218 --> 06:30.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the United Nations today,
hopeful words
on Syria. A special envoy
declared that a

06:30.757 --> 06:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fire is mostly holding
after six days.
In Geneva, Staffan de Mistura
said the truce

06:37.697 --> 06:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is fragile, but has -- quote --
"greatly reduced
the violence."

06:41.468 --> 06:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: This is good
news for many

06:44.004 --> 06:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian people. Unfortunately, we
have to admit,
like in every cessation of
hostilities or

06:50.577 --> 06:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fire, and in particular in
this one,
there are still a number of
places where fighting

06:56.349 --> 07:01.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has continued, including parts
of Hama, Homs,
Latakia, and Damascus.

07:01.521 --> 07:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Amnesty International
charged Russian and Syrian
government forces

07:07.861 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are deliberately targeting
hospitals in and
around Aleppo. It said that
amounts to war

07:13.566 --> 07:15.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crimes.

07:15.402 --> 07:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea has answered a new
round of U.N.
sanctions by firing half-a-dozen
short-range

07:20.206 --> 07:26.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projectiles into the sea. South
Korea's military
says they were fired today near
the eastern

07:26.179 --> 07:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town of Wonsan and flew less
than 100 miles.
Later, the North announced that
its leader,

07:32.919 --> 07:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim Jong-un, has ordered the
military to be
ready to fire nuclear weapons at
any time.

07:39.826 --> 07:44.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
European leaders sounded
increasingly desperate
today to deal with the mounting
migrant crisis

07:44.964 --> 07:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Greece. Nearly 32,000 people
are stranded,
and largely blocked from moving
deeper into

07:51.237 --> 07:52.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the continent.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Mates of Independent
Television News
is there on the ground.

07:55.675 --> 08:00.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM / JAMES MATES: Don't come
to Greece,
they have been told. Don't
believe the smugglers.

08:00.246 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You won't get any further. But,
still, they
come, 600 more pouring onto the
keys in the

08:06.252 --> 08:08.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Port of Piraeus this morning.

08:08.121 --> 08:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for these new arrivals,
things have changed.
No longer are they being waved
through on

08:12.959 --> 08:18.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their journey north. For many
now, a tent
on the dockside is the end of
the road. The

08:18.798 --> 08:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main ferry terminal has been
home to several
hundred for more than a week
now, many young

08:23.903 --> 08:28.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
children, for whom the
longed-for passage
to Germany may never happen.

08:28.808 --> 08:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what happens when you
try and block
a human tide as it flows
northwards. Just

08:34.180 --> 08:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week or so ago, all of these
people would
have moved on across the
Macedonian border

08:39.085 --> 08:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and towards Northern Europe.
Now, well, they're
struck here.

08:42.889 --> 08:47.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's obvious that Greece
cannot do
it alone. It was never a Greek
problem. It

08:47.427 --> 08:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was always a European and a
global problem.
You cannot expect from one
country to share

08:53.233 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this big responsibility.

08:55.835 --> 09:01.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES MATES: Senior E.U.
officials are in
Athens today trying to reassure
the Greeks

09:01.074 --> 09:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not alone. But the words
are aimed
at those still thinking of
traveling.

09:05.478 --> 09:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: Do
not come to Europe. Do not
believe the smugglers.

09:12.252 --> 09:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do not risk your lives and your
money. It
is all for nothing.

09:17.257 --> 09:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: But for those
already here, Greece
may no longer be a transit
country. In Athens'

09:22.695 --> 09:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picturesque squares, many
hundreds now sleep
in the open. They can't move on.
They won't

09:27.734 --> 09:29.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go back.

09:29.602 --> 09:34.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But like Zohreg Gasam and her
four sisters
from Afghanistan, they have
found no welcome.

09:34.474 --> 09:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZOHREG GASAM, Refugee: We are
tonight sleeping
there, and we not have two...

09:40.547 --> 09:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: Your blankets.

09:42.248 --> 09:46.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZOHREG GASAM: Yes, blankets,
yes. The winter
was really cool.

09:46.219 --> 09:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: There was once a
warm welcome
for refugees when they came off
the boats

09:50.757 --> 09:56.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, but that was when they
were able to
move on through. Now the burden
seems to be

09:56.062 --> 10:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
falling on Greeks alone. And
patience and
tolerance are becoming harder to
find.

10:01.468 --> 10:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The migrant
crisis will be
the main subject at a European
Union summit

10:06.105 --> 10:07.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Monday.

10:07.941 --> 10:12.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Oregon is
set to become
the first state to eliminate
coal from its

10:12.579 --> 10:18.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy supply by law. The state
legislature
gave final approval yesterday to
the move.

10:18.084 --> 10:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It takes full effect by 2030.
Governor Kate
Brown has indicated she will
sign the bill.

10:24.123 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street made some modest
progress today.
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 44

10:29.529 --> 10:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to close near 16944. The
Nasdaq rose
four. And the S&amp;P 500 added
nearly seven.

10:38.271 --> 10:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama says he will
do something
few presidents have done: stay
in Washington

10:43.743 --> 10:49.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after he leaves office. He said
today in Milwaukee
that he wants Sasha, his younger
daughter,

10:49.415 --> 10:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to finish high school before the
family moves.
She's now in the ninth grade.

10:54.654 --> 11:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two leading
Republican voices on Mitt Romney
and the feverish

11:00.727 --> 11:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts to stop Donald Trump;
mosquitoes that
fight the virus they spread; the
horrifying

11:07.567 --> 11:17.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ways ISIS is using child
soldiers; and much
more.

11:17.377 --> 11:28.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The deep divides among
Republicans were on
full public display today with
Donald Trump

11:28.988 --> 11:31.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
again the center of attention.

11:31.157 --> 11:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore the rifts now with
Michael Leavitt,
former Republican governor of
Utah. And Stephen

11:37.297 --> 11:41.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moore, he's an economist at
FreedomWorks.
It's a conservative political
group.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, gentlemen, welcome to both
of you.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Governor Leavitt, to you first.

11:46.472 --> 11:52.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know you know Governor Romney
well. This
is almost unprecedented in
American politics,

11:52.679 --> 11:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the former standard-bearer
to be going
after the current front-runner
like this.

11:58.117 --> 12:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four years ago, Mitt Romney
praised Donald
Trump. He begged for his
endorsement, according

12:04.824 --> 12:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Mr. Trump. What changed?

12:06.626 --> 12:09.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL LEAVITT, Former
Secretary of Health
and Human Services: Well, I have
the benefit

12:09.395 --> 12:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of having actually been there,
and I can tell
you that the way Donald Trump
described it

12:15.134 --> 12:17.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is simply not accurate.

12:17.036 --> 12:22.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Governor Romney
graciously received
his endorsement. But I think it
would be valuable

12:22.342 --> 12:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for me to at least provide a bit
of personal
context here. I think what we
have seen is

12:27.413 --> 12:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a personal statement on Governor
Romney's
part.

12:30.783 --> 12:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have all had a
brother or a sister
or a close friend we care about
who's about

12:35.788 --> 12:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make a very serious mistake
that will have
bad consequences and we watch it
happening,

12:41.494 --> 12:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there's a point at which we
just simply
say, I have to say something or
I'm not going

12:45.498 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to feel good about myself.

12:47.333 --> 12:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mitt Romney feels that
way about the
country, and this was a
statement of his own

12:51.504 --> 12:58.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
views of how important it is
that this not
be made in the context of an
emotional state

12:58.511 --> 13:01.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I think we all understand,
but would
produce bad consequences.

13:01.748 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Governor
Leavitt, we saw
Mitt Romney said he wasn't there
to announce

13:07.220 --> 13:12.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his own candidacy, but he didn't
rule it out
either. Is he waiting to be
called on? We

13:12.425 --> 13:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
notice that he didn't endorse
any of the other
candidates in the race.

13:16.429 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL LEAVITT: He says
privately to me the
same things he says publicly,
and that is

13:21.634 --> 13:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is not a candidate and
doesn't intend to
be a candidate.

13:24.270 --> 13:30.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think this was, as I
suggested, a desire
to express his views at a time
on a matter

13:30.476 --> 13:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he feels deeply about and
about a country
he cares deeply about and a
party he cares

13:35.381 --> 13:37.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deeply about.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Moore,
what was your
reaction to Governor Romney's
statement?

13:40.019 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE, FreedomWorks: Hi,
Judy.

13:41.788 --> 13:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, first, let me say I don't
have a horse
in this race. I like Mitt
Romney. I like,

13:46.192 --> 13:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually, Ted Cruz and Donald
Trump. So, I'm
not necessarily in favor of one
over the other,

13:53.566 --> 13:55.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but I will say this.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, I did support
Mitt Romney
when he ran for president. I
have been in

13:58.037 --> 14:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics for 30 years. I think
what Mitt Romney
did, with all due respect,
Governor, today

14:03.142 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was totally disgraceful.

14:04.911 --> 14:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am so ashamed of him, as a
Republican, to
go after the Republican
front-runner, the

14:10.683 --> 14:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person who is very, very likely
to be the
Republican nominee, and
basically to say that

14:15.288 --> 14:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's dishonest, that he's a
phony, to call
his voters, the millions and
millions of middle-class,

14:22.028 --> 14:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blue-collar workers who Donald
Trump has brought
into the party, which is one
thing I love

14:26.099 --> 14:30.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about Donald Trump as a
Republican -- he's
bringing all these people into
the party -- to

14:30.036 --> 14:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
call them suckers, I just am
outraged by it.

14:33.873 --> 14:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, I actually
think that this
-- that the American people and
a lot of the

14:38.444 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican voters are outraged
by it, too.
And I actually think, Judy, that
this is going

14:42.982 --> 14:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help Donald Trump, because it
makes the
point that he is representing
the kind of

14:47.887 --> 14:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
middle-class, blue-collar voters
who haven't
seen a pay raise in 10 years,
and that, you

14:53.126 --> 14:59.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know, the establishment
Republicans are totally
against him and they will do
anything they

14:59.232 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can to stop him.

15:01.067 --> 15:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one last point, if I may,
Judy. You know,
a lot of -- I'm a conservative
Republican,

15:05.938 --> 15:12.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I have kind of held my nose.
And I have,
you know, worked for Bob Dole to
win and Mitt

15:12.078 --> 15:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Romney, even though I had
serious disagreements
with them, because the
establishment always

15:16.516 --> 15:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, you conservatives have to
get behind
the candidate.

15:19.552 --> 15:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, now the establishment, now
they don't
like the candidate and they're
saying they're

15:25.024 --> 15:26.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not going to get behind him.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Governor, I just think
that's -- that's
duplicitous.

15:28.327 --> 15:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor, what
about that?
Could what Governor Romney did
today backfire

15:35.101 --> 15:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in what he said about the people
who support
the -- what, a third or more of
the Republican

15:41.107 --> 15:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
electorate who support Donald
Trump?

15:43.309 --> 15:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEAVITT: I think there
will be people
who react that way, in the same
way that sometimes

15:48.214 --> 15:52.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we tell a brother or a sister or
a friend
who is involved in some sort of
emotional

15:52.318 --> 15:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing that has them charged up,
and they're
about to make a big mistake,
say, I'm going

15:56.823 --> 16:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do this because you said this
about it.

16:01.527 --> 16:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think Mitt has made a
personal
statement. This is the way he
feels. This

16:05.164 --> 16:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the way he believes. And he
simply didn't
feel, doesn't feel that he
wanted this to

16:10.770 --> 16:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go forward without having made
that statement.

16:13.372 --> 16:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But do you see
how voters could
take this as an insult, if you
will? And are

16:20.613 --> 16:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you worried Democrats will use
what he said
against Donald Trump in the fall
if Trump

16:26.819 --> 16:27.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is the nominee?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: That's what I'm
worried about.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEAVITT: Well, the
Democrats have
a lot they can use if Mr. Trump
is in fact

16:32.491 --> 16:34.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nominee.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, this is a personal
statement. He's
not the nominee and he's not
running to be

16:37.029 --> 16:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a candidate. He's not running
for president.
He is saying what he believes is
important

16:41.901 --> 16:46.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the American people to know
about Donald
Trump and he is calling the
question.

16:46.305 --> 16:51.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called the question on his
tax returns
and said, release them, so we
can see, and

16:51.444 --> 16:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he doesn't, that's all the
proof that's
necessary. You might recall that
Governor

16:56.449 --> 17:00.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Romney went through this
himself. And I think
he concluded it was a mistake
for him not

17:00.219 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have done it sooner and in a
way that answered
the questions. He's saying the
same thing

17:04.857 --> 17:08.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to Donald Trump and has
questions that I think
many other people share.

17:08.394 --> 17:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Moore,
you said a minute
ago you think this could end up
helping Donald

17:13.065 --> 17:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, but what about the other
efforts out
there?

17:14.901 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hear that big donors in the
Republican
Party are trying to raise money
to help, whether

17:21.407 --> 17:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz? What
about those
efforts?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN MOORE: Yes. Yes.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, they're out there. And
there's no -- I
mean, this is the Republican
establishment,

17:28.214 --> 17:32.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the millionaires and
billionaires of the
party think that they can buy
this election.

17:32.952 --> 17:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, where I disagree
with -- and,
again, I disagree with Donald
Trump, Judy,

17:37.590 --> 17:39.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a lot of things.

17:39.492 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I disagree with him fervently on
immigration
and trade. I am a pro-free
trade, pro-immigration

17:44.463 --> 17:49.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican, just as the governor
is. But what
I object to is this idea that
we're not going

17:49.135 --> 17:50.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to let the voters speak.

17:51.003 --> 17:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think just that a lot of
the Republican
establishment is insulting --
you used that

17:55.041 --> 17:59.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
word, and I think it was exactly
the right
word -- it's an insult to the
people who go

17:59.145 --> 18:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to these things. I have been
to some of
these Donald Trump rallies,
Judy, and it is

18:03.115 --> 18:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
amazing the people who turn out.

18:05.318 --> 18:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are bikers and they're
carpenters and
they're soccer moms and they're
veterans and

18:10.022 --> 18:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who care fervently about
this country.
I just am very reluctant. And I
hate to see

18:16.128 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them dissed this way by the
Republican establishment.
I just think it's beneath the
party.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, Donald Trump is
going to
be the nominee, and you're
right, Judy. These

18:25.404 --> 18:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insults are going to come back
and haunt our
nominee in November.

18:29.175 --> 18:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly to
both of you,
could you each support Donald
Trump if he

18:32.912 --> 18:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ends up being the nominee of the
Republican
Party?

18:35.247 --> 18:37.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Governor Leavitt?

18:37.149 --> 18:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEAVITT: I think we all
want a Republican
to win the presidency and think
it's deeply

18:41.087 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:43.289 --> 18:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL LEAVITT: ... deeply
important that,
in fact, it happens. And I think
that's why

18:46.492 --> 18:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney spoke as well.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And...

18:49.729 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN MOORE: I would
certainly, Judy, support
any of these Republicans over
Hillary Clinton.

18:52.431 --> 18:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will say this. If Donald
Trump is the
nominee, he is going to win 35
states. He

18:56.469 --> 19:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to win New York. He's
going to -- I
just disagree with the polls. I
think he brings

19:00.973 --> 19:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tens of millions of new voters
into the Republican
Party.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will leave it
there.

19:05.544 --> 19:06.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stephen Moore...

19:06.178 --> 19:07.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:07.613 --> 19:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL LEAVITT: Governor Romney
also obviously
disagrees with Stephen.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:11.517 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right. We got
-- we did
get that sense today from his
news conference.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: I love the
governor, by the
way.

19:15.855 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Moore,
Governor Michael
Leavitt, thank you both.

19:22.762 --> 19:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN MOORE: Thank you.

19:28.034 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With the outbreak
of the Zika
virus growing across the
Americas, scientists

19:35.441 --> 19:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are working on new ways to try
to stop its
spread by targeting the insects
that carry

19:40.746 --> 19:43.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the virus, mosquitoes.

19:43.082 --> 19:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One idea centers on altering
mosquitoes so
they will declare war on other
mosquitoes.

19:48.954 --> 19:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has our
report. It's part of his series
of stories

19:53.426 --> 19:55.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he's filed from Brazil on
Zika.

19:55.928 --> 20:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The most deadly
animals on
Earth may have finally met their
match, and

20:02.368 --> 20:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the enemy is them. This is the
scene every
morning in Piracicaba, Brazil,
where the mosquito-borne

20:09.308 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zika virus is raging, along with
a long-running
outbreak of dengue fever.

20:16.248 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Scientists hit the road,
releasing swarms
of genetically modified
mosquitoes that carry

20:22.388 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a DNA time bomb. They are killer
mosquitoes.

20:24.957 --> 20:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA TEPEDINO, Oxitec: We are
in a colony
room. This is where we want to
have females

20:29.829 --> 20:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happy, healthy, and things like
that.

20:33.099 --> 20:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: These mosquitoes
are created
by a British company called
Oxitec. Karla

20:37.670 --> 20:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tepedino runs the supply line.

20:39.839 --> 20:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA TEPEDINO: This is the
biggest mosquito
factory in the whole world. We
are producing

20:44.710 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two million male mosquitoes per
week.

20:46.879 --> 20:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You could say
it's in-gene-ious.
Oxitec technicians insert a
synthetic gene

20:52.618 --> 20:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into mosquito eggs that causes
them to create
too many proteins. It's a fatal
disease.

20:59.225 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While they are still in the lab,
they're given
an antidote that keeps the
disease at bay.

21:06.565 --> 21:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once they are released, they
find a female
and breed. But their offspring
inherit the

21:11.504 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gene that causes the fatal
disease. With no
antidotes in the wild, they die
not long after

21:17.843 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are hatched, before they
can breed.

21:20.146 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA TEPEDINO: The beauty of
this technique
is that it can reach the
mosquitoes where

21:24.683 --> 21:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no other technique can find it.
We are using
mosquitoes to fight themselves.

21:27.953 --> 21:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It appears to be
working. And
here's how they know. In
addition to the killer

21:33.359 --> 21:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gene, they add one that's a
special marker.
Only the genetically modified
mosquitoes will

21:38.664 --> 21:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glow under a special light. This
way, they
can track the mosquito
population. They say

21:44.303 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
90 percent of the insects in
this area now
carry the fatal flaw.

21:48.207 --> 21:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARLA TEPEDINO: As the health
secretary of
Piracicaba has stated last year
they had 133

21:53.979 --> 21:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases of dengue, this year, only
one in the
area that we are treating.

21:58.150 --> 22:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Mosquitoes
killing mosquitoes.
It may sound too good to be
true, and despite

22:03.222 --> 22:09.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than a decade of work, it
remains unclear
if this can have lasting impact
on a bigger

22:09.428 --> 22:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scale. It's a high-tech twist in
the long,
difficult war to stop the spread
of diseases

22:14.867 --> 22:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carried by the mosquito species
called Aedes
aegypti.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been battling the same
enemy for generations.

22:21.941 --> 22:27.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Notice the
white-tipped palps, the
triangular white spots on the
abdomen, the

22:27.580 --> 22:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white leg bands, and the white
flyer shaped
design on the thorax. These are
characteristic

22:33.519 --> 22:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the adult aegypti mosquito.

22:35.387 --> 22:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Aegypti is blamed
for spreading
Zika virus, as well as dengue,
West Nile and

22:41.493 --> 22:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yellow fever. Combined, the
diseases infect
hundreds of millions of people a
year, causing

22:47.166 --> 22:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a host of maladies and birth
defects, killing
several million.

22:51.837 --> 22:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with Zika, there is growing
concern here
that other species are guilty as
well. In

22:59.111 --> 23:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this government lab in Recife,
Brazil, they
are working to develop a test
that can tell

23:04.149 --> 23:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if a mosquito is carrying Zika
virus.

23:06.619 --> 23:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, no one knows for
certain how common
it is, or in which species.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcelo Paiva is a molecular
entomologist.

23:14.760 --> 23:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when compare this
against dengue
or yellow fever, any number of
other viruses

23:19.298 --> 23:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borne by mosquitoes, we don't
know so much
about Zika, do we?

23:21.800 --> 23:22.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCELO PAIVA, Molecular
Entomologist: We
have no idea, actually.

23:22.868 --> 23:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Really? Tell me.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCELO PAIVA: This is totally
new.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's kind of --
well, it's
virgin science.

23:27.906 --> 23:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCELO PAIVA: It is, yes. We
were in a dark
field, now -- no light at end of
tunnel. Now

23:34.346 --> 23:36.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're trying to clarify things.

23:36.515 --> 23:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: As they try to
solve this complex
puzzle, his boss, entomologist
Constancia

23:42.988 --> 23:48.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ayres, is trying to prove a
theory that would
have huge, global implications,
that another

23:48.827 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquito species called Culex
quinquefasciatus
could also be a so-called vector
for Zika.

23:54.833 --> 24:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Culex is 20 times more abundant
here in Brazil,
and is also much more common
than Aedis aegypti

24:02.241 --> 24:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in North America and Europe.

24:04.076 --> 24:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONSTANCIA AYRES, Entomologist:
In Micronesia,
when we had the first outbreak
of the Zika

24:08.280 --> 24:14.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2007, there is no Aedes
aegypti there.
So, probably, another vector was
transmitting

24:14.787 --> 24:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the disease. And Culex also
transmitted other
arbovirus, such as West Nile
virus, Japanese

24:23.429 --> 24:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
encephalitis, so why not Zika?

24:25.331 --> 24:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The two breeds
behave very
differently. Culex bites at
night, while aegypti

24:30.569 --> 24:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prefers the day. Culex breeds in
dirty water.
Aegypti likes her water clean.
This would

24:36.508 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dramatically up the ante for
traditional mosquito
control techniques.

24:40.279 --> 24:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CONSTANCIA AYRES: So, if both
species are
involved, you will have to use
repellent 24

24:45.651 --> 24:46.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hours a day, basically.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wow. Yes. So
you're going deet
all the time.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CONSTANCIA AYRES: Yes, all the
time.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's not good.
That's an
important, a significant thing.
It's a 24-hour

24:54.026 --> 24:55.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

24:55.794 --> 24:59.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are infecting Culex
mosquitoes with Zika
in the lab, then dissecting them
to see how

24:59.631 --> 25:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they carry and transmit the
virus. The jury
is still out on what happens in
the real world.

25:05.571 --> 25:10.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could mean there will be
demand for another
breed of weaponized mosquito.

25:10.275 --> 25:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This not a new battle here in
Brazil. As a
matter of fact, it's actually a
long war.

25:14.279 --> 25:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have had some success
over the years.
In the mid-'50s and the
mid-'70s, they very

25:19.385 --> 25:24.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nearly eradicated these
mosquitoes using pesticides,
many of them DDT.

25:24.189 --> 25:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even before DDT was banned,
though, the
mosquitoes developed a
resistance to it. So,

25:30.195 --> 25:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, with the population of
humans and mosquitoes
so much greater than ever, there
really is

25:35.467 --> 25:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no realistic way to think about
eradication.

25:38.637 --> 25:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But scientists all over the
world are not
ready to surrender. Leslie
Vosshall is a professor

25:44.810 --> 25:47.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of neurogenetics at the
Rockefeller University
in New York.

25:48.013 --> 25:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE VOSSHALL, Rockefeller
University: So
we're trying to figure out why
some people

25:50.282 --> 25:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are more attractive than others.
The diseases
start with a mosquito. The
mosquito needs

25:53.886 --> 25:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to find someone to bite. The
more attractive
people are bitten more. We want
to understand

25:57.723 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
why that is.

25:59.525 --> 26:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: She and her team
performed
what they all the mosquito
magnet study. Open

26:03.262 --> 26:09.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gate, and down the chute
they go. Turns
out mosquitoes love some of us
more than others.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what is the differentiator?

26:11.270 --> 26:15.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE VOSSHALL: So, mosquitoes,
especially
the mosquitoes that are
spreading Zika, dengue,

26:15.441 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chikungunya, they love humans
over any other
animal. So they're cuing into
our body odor,

26:20.946 --> 26:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the carbon dioxide in our
breath, our body
heat. So, it's the body odor
that I think

26:26.785 --> 26:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is what distinguishes us from

MILES O'BRIEN: Vosshall and her
team are creating
designer mosquitoes. It's
genetic engineering,

26:36.328 --> 26:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but a different version from
Oxitec's self-destructing
insects.

26:39.798 --> 26:45.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here, they create unique
attributes, for example,
a bug that can't detect certain
odors, to

26:45.671 --> 26:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try and understand what they are
hunting.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE VOSSHALL: Obviously, if
we figure out
what makes a mosquito magnet
attractive, then

26:51.710 --> 26:57.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have understood a big part of
what mosquitoes
are hunting. Then we can
interrupt their hunting

26:57.282 --> 26:59.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

26:59.084 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the meantime,
all we really
have are nets and deet.
Researchers aren't

27:02.855 --> 27:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even sure how the chemical
thwarts mosquitoes.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can't science do better?

27:08.360 --> 27:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE VOSSHALL: Ultimately, how
cool would
it be to have like a cream that
you put on

27:11.897 --> 27:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your arm that has a probiotic,
right, that
makes you demagnetized as a
mosquito magnet?

27:18.203 --> 27:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, for now,
there is little
to stop the global health havoc
caused by

27:23.175 --> 27:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquitoes. Zika and birth
defects are just
part of the devastation. The
most deadly animal

27:29.648 --> 27:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Earth is an easy foe to
underestimate and
it marches on with impunity.

her inner beast.

28:07.286 --> 28:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: A new study provides
a disturbing
look into the ways ISIS uses
children to fight

28:13.525 --> 28:14.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its battles.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan has our
conversation.

28:16.595 --> 28:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A new report
published by
the Combating Terrorism Center
at West Point

28:21.066 --> 28:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chronicles the increasing use of
children
as fighters for the so-called
Islamic State.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report's authors, based at
Georgia State
University in Atlanta,
documented the Islamic

28:29.708 --> 28:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State's own propaganda, which
praises deceased
young fighters as martyrs. It
shows how the

28:35.948 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group uses children and youth in
suicide operations.
They found three times as many
suicide attacks

28:41.954 --> 28:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
involving young people in
January of this
year than last year.

28:45.691 --> 28:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the study's findings
and what
they mean, we're joined by one
of the report's

28:50.095 --> 28:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
authors, professor Mia Bloom.

28:51.897 --> 28:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Problem Bloom, unfortunately,
child soldiers
aren't anything new. So, how is
ISIS using

28:56.802 --> 28:58.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them differently?

28:58.470 --> 29:02.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIA BLOOM, Georgia State
University: So, we
started our study with a
baseline looking

29:02.608 --> 29:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the literature on child
soldiers, looking
at biographies and
autobiographies of people

29:06.545 --> 29:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had been child soldiers, in
order to get
a sense of what we thought we
might expect.

29:11.850 --> 29:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we expected that children
would be
used when they ran out of adults
or when they

29:16.121 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't find adults, or that
children would
be used against civilian
targets. And we didn't

29:20.759 --> 29:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
find either of those. Instead,
what we found
was that children in ISIS are
used alongside

29:26.431 --> 29:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the adults, not instead, and, in
fact, only
3 percent of the time were
children used against

29:32.004 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilian targets; 61 percent of
the time,
they were going after what we
would call hard

29:37.109 --> 29:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targets, military, police,
militias and the
army.

29:40.579 --> 29:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So they're
doing just what
the grownups do.

29:43.081 --> 29:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: They're doing exactly
what the
grownups do, and, in fact, we
found considerably

29:47.653 --> 29:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more suicide bombers than anyone
expected.

29:50.422 --> 29:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you said
-- you actually
break it down; 39 percent are
driving basically

29:55.761 --> 29:57.562 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
car bombs?

29:57.596 --> 30:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: Thirty-nine percent
were car bombs.
These were vehicle-borne
improvised explosive

30:02.501 --> 30:05.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
device, so it's a VBIED.

30:05.604 --> 30:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of the children were
also wearing
what we would call a suicide
belt, which is

30:09.775 --> 30:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an individual IED that is
attached to them,
so they were part of these
marauding raids,

30:16.348 --> 30:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these inghimasi, so they would
go into the
target, shoot and then blow up
the IED or

30:21.920 --> 30:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the suicide belt at the end of
the operation.

30:24.456 --> 30:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, it used
to be that
groups would recruit in secret,
that they

30:29.461 --> 30:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knew that there was going to be
societal backlash.
This is the opposite.

30:33.231 --> 30:37.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're saying in your report
that ISIS brags
about the fact that they're
recruiting young

30:37.235 --> 30:39.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

30:39.037 --> 30:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: Not only is ISIS
boasting that
they're using these children,
but they're

30:42.207 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using the children also in a way
to humiliate
the men.

30:45.644 --> 30:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we didn't put into report,
but will be
exploring further, is that ISIS
is using the

30:51.950 --> 30:57.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, for example, in the
prison to determines
who lives and dies. They're also
using the

30:57.255 --> 31:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children to actually carry out
the execution,
and so they're empowering the
children, and

31:02.327 --> 31:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by doing so, disempowering the
men.

31:05.931 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a way in which they
are recruiting
the children to basically feel
like you will

31:10.135 --> 31:15.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be more than what you are. You
won't be a
child in a society where you're
lesser than,

31:15.273 --> 31:19.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but you will be powerful, you
will be a cub
and then eventually a lion.

31:19.478 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you watched
through all
of these images and videos, you
actually point

31:25.717 --> 31:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out that almost half these
children have smiles
on their faces, at least in the
propaganda

31:30.422 --> 31:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that comes out after. Explain
that.

31:32.758 --> 31:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: Well, one of the
things that we
tried to do is, we're trying to
get a sense

31:36.661 --> 31:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of, is there any coercion? Are
the children
there voluntarily?

31:41.333 --> 31:46.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, again, using
the baseline
of child soldiers, the
stereotypical story

31:46.772 --> 31:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we know from Liberia or
Uganda is that
these children are coerced and
they're drugged,

31:53.145 --> 31:57.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and so they're made to
perpetrate an act of
horrific violence against
members of their

31:57.516 --> 32:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own family, so that they can
never go back
to their village.

32:00.886 --> 32:05.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't find that with ISIS.
We found parents
who willingly gave the
terrorists access to

32:05.857 --> 32:10.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their children. They encouraged
the children.
One of the images, for example,
we even see

32:10.695 --> 32:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the father saying goodbye to his
son.

32:13.231 --> 32:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also saw a lot of images
where the
kids are smiling and they look
like they are

32:18.003 --> 32:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very excited about this future.
They even
put them in a setting that looks
like the

32:22.874 --> 32:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Garden of Eden, in order to
convey that that's
where they're headed; they're
going to paradise.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what kind
of age range
are we talking about? Obviously,
under 18

32:30.782 --> 32:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
qualifies as a child, but how
young were some
of these kids?

32:33.752 --> 32:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: So, we used age
categories based
on developmental psychology.

32:39.891 --> 32:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the kids were as young
as 8. So, we
had again -- an age range of
8-12, 13-15,

32:47.899 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
16-18, and we didn't go above
18. And anyone
we knew that might be over 18,
we didn't include

32:53.805 --> 32:55.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the study.

32:55.740 --> 32:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
we have this
information. How should this
inform our policy-making

32:59.244 --> 33:01.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or our strategy to combat this?

33:01.213 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: I mean, part of it is
that we have
seen in other instances
terrorist groups using

33:06.852 --> 33:11.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very young children. So,
although they didn't
brag about it, we did some field
research

33:11.356 --> 33:17.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Pakistan, where the Pakistani
Taliban has
forcibly recruited very young
kids to be suicide

33:18.029 --> 33:19.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bombers.

33:19.831 --> 33:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that there are ways of
de-radicalizing
and deprogramming these
children, but it's

33:25.871 --> 33:31.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very involved, it's very
expensive. It requires
a multipronged approach. So part
of it is,

33:31.643 --> 33:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what do we do when soldiers are
facing children?

33:35.080 --> 33:39.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that there are increased
levels of
PTSD. But we also have to figure
out ways

33:39.684 --> 33:44.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just of preventing the
children from entering
in the first place, but what do
we do with

33:44.756 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them once we find them?

33:46.558 --> 33:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, while
several of
these children were from Iraq
and Syria, you

33:50.662 --> 33:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point out that some of these
children came
from other countries far
overseas as well.

33:55.533 --> 34:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how did they get there? We
can understand
that a 22-year-old figures out a
way to get

34:00.605 --> 34:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a bus, on a plane. How did
these small
kids from, say, Europe, get in?

34:04.142 --> 34:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: Well, what's the
really horrific
part of the study is we
discovered how many

34:08.446 --> 34:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parents are bringing their
children with them.

34:10.849 --> 34:17.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, among the foreign fighters
that are coming
from the United Kingdom and
France, Belgium,

34:17.522 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tunisia, Egypt, they're bringing
their entire
families with them when they go.
And they're

34:22.761 --> 34:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically giving the terrorists
access to
these children when they get
there.

34:26.698 --> 34:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we are seeing parents who
are basically
colluding with the terrorists
and allowing

34:31.770 --> 34:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their children to die at a very
early age.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Mia
Bloom, thanks
so much.

34:36.408 --> 34:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIA BLOOM: Thank you so much for
having me.

34:42.781 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In recent years,
there's been
more attention on discrimination
in places

34:56.027 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like Silicon Valley and
Hollywood.

34:58.496 --> 35:03.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's been less attention
of late to
the continuing problem of
harassment and outright

35:03.335 --> 35:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sexism in some firms on Wall
Street and the
financial industry. Companies
long have engaged

35:09.474 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in training workers about
appropriate behavior,
but lawsuits are still being
filed against

35:15.447 --> 35:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
firms alleging bias and a
culture of harassment.

35:19.017 --> 35:24.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A new book casts a harsh
spotlight on the
way women have been treated over
time.

35:24.522 --> 35:28.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
has the story. It's part of his
weekly series,

35:28.994 --> 35:31.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Making Sense, which airs every
Thursday on
the "NewsHour."

35:31.863 --> 35:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Stock's going to Pluto,
man.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Start unloading.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: What? Sell?

35:36.468 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Dump it now. Dump it all.

35:39.170 --> 35:44.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Trading floors, for
years, the
cliche has been a menagerie of
men. And even

35:44.876 --> 35:50.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, only about 15 percent of
traders are
female. So, what's it like for a
woman?

35:50.081 --> 35:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY, Author, "Opening
Belle": One
woman I know used to work with a
managing

35:52.784 --> 35:56.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director. If women were walking
by in a skirt,
he would throw himself on the
floor, pretend

35:56.888 --> 36:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look up their skirt. And they
would -- he
would get the laugh, you know,
from the other

36:00.892 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guys.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Former Bear Stearns
managing
director Maureen Sherry had her
own trying

36:05.530 --> 36:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walk when she worked on Wall
Street.

36:07.298 --> 36:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: When I had come
back from
my maternity leave, I was still
nursing, and

36:11.870 --> 36:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept a breast pump under my
desk. One trader
would notice, and he would start
making a

36:16.508 --> 36:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mooing sound, and, you know,
sometimes other
herd members would join in.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Actually mooing?

36:23.248 --> 36:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Yes, mooing.

36:25.350 --> 36:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one night, I was leaving.
And someone
came to tell me that there had
been a bet

36:30.021 --> 36:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a young guy wouldn't do a
shot of my
breast milk, and that he had
risen to the

36:35.460 --> 36:36.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
challenge.

36:36.561 --> 36:39.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ACTORS: Do hereby pledge
allegiance to the
frat.

36:39.064 --> 36:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Frat-boy antics and
overt sexism
are vivid features of Sherry's
new novel,

36:45.070 --> 36:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Opening Belle," based on her
experiences
on a trading floor in the 1990s,
and those

36:50.775 --> 36:52.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of others still in the business.

36:52.477 --> 36:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: On the floor I
worked on,
we had some ex-professional
athletes.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: You had
ex-professional...

36:57.115 --> 36:59.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Many --
professional athletes,
New York Ranger. We had a Knick.
We had people

36:59.818 --> 37:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who really, really lived that
team mentality.

37:03.488 --> 37:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the competitive
edge?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Very
competitive. Loved to
win, yes.

37:07.525 --> 37:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Loved to win. Loved
to compete,
loved to win, loved to risk.

37:12.630 --> 37:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: There's no
walls, and they're
all together, and there's the --
the cortisol

37:17.302 --> 37:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high of doing trades together
every single
day, lots of testosterone.

37:23.141 --> 37:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you can see where risk
becomes part
of the language.

37:28.546 --> 37:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the more risk
you take, the
greater the high?

37:31.983 --> 37:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: I think that's a
proven fact.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Indeed, it is.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Harvard behavioral economist
Iris Bohnet has
studied the research.

37:39.290 --> 37:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRIS BOHNET, Harvard Business
School: After
having experienced the wins, in
particular

37:42.327 --> 37:49.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, men testosterone tends to
spike. And that
makes men even more willing to
take risks.

37:49.167 --> 37:54.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That has been coined the
winner's effect,
meaning that, when we experience
a win, that

37:54.739 --> 37:59.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affects how we perceive risks
going forward,
and become even more
risk-loving.

37:59.744 --> 38:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interestingly enough, a number
of papers now
have been written which couldn't
find a winner's

38:04.582 --> 38:06.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effect for women.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that might help
explain why
women on Wall Street are paid
just 68 cents

38:09.654 --> 38:17.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a man's dollar, and so few
make it to or
near the top. The males in
charge value the

38:17.095 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winner's effect, even though it
exaggerates
losses too.

38:20.765 --> 38:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRIS BOHNET: Research does
suggest that diverse
teams do outperform homogeneous
teams.

38:25.837 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet, says
Sherry, women are
discriminated against in lots of
ways.

38:31.276 --> 38:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Accounts not
being given equitably,
that's really one way, or an
account being

38:37.549 --> 38:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken away when you felt it
wasn't something
that you deserved. You have to
understand

38:42.687 --> 38:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these men make a really
good living,
and chances are very high that,
if they have

38:47.091 --> 38:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children, their wife is probably
staying home
with their children.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is just sort of understood
that, at a certain
point, you're going to just
leave to be with

38:53.765 --> 38:55.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your family.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's not just on
Wall Street,
says Professor Bohnet.

38:57.001 --> 39:02.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IRIS BOHNET: We do know that
bias creeps in
whenever we take potential into
account. We

39:02.774 --> 39:07.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't naturally expect women to
want to climb
up the career leader.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEONARDO DICAPRIO, Actor:
Everybody had a
good week?

39:09.280 --> 39:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And if you don't
think women
are likely to climb, then it's a
lot easier

39:13.585 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to treat them less
professionally.

39:15.820 --> 39:20.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEONARDO DICAPRIO: I have
offered our lovely
sales assistant Danielle
Harrison here $10,000

39:20.124 --> 39:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to shave her (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
head!

39:23.761 --> 39:25.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:25.563 --> 39:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Maureen Sherry knew
a female
banker who approached a male
trader about

39:30.301 --> 39:32.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a promotion.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: She was really
vivacious and
beautiful, and she went over and
she talked

39:35.139 --> 39:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to him about it, and he said,
yes, let's -- we
need to sit down, have a proper
interview,

39:38.977 --> 39:40.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
et cetera.

39:40.745 --> 39:48.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, let's meet at this
bar. And she
gets there, and she sat down at
the table,

39:48.720 --> 39:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she said, when she put it
down and started
her prepared interview, he said,
that's what

39:55.326 --> 40:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is about? And he threw a
hotel room key
on the -- on the table, and
said, you know,

40:00.932 --> 40:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought that's why you wanted
to meet, or
something like -- to that
effect.

40:03.935 --> 40:09.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No shock that, in
the last decade,
several major financial firms
have settled

40:09.040 --> 40:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large gender discrimination
cases, while smaller
suits, usually handled in-house
and kept hush-hush,

40:15.880 --> 40:17.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abound.

40:17.782 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: One of the
people I have spoken
with is a lawyer. I said, how
many cases in

40:23.021 --> 40:26.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this genre do you have a year?
And he said,
my firm? About 80.

40:26.958 --> 40:27.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Eighty?

40:28.026 --> 40:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Eight-zero, one
firm.

40:29.994 --> 40:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For years, Sherry
herself found
Wall Street gratifying,
atmosphere notwithstanding.

40:36.534 --> 40:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she left in 2000, when she
realized she'd
gone about as far as she could
go.

40:41.572 --> 40:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Look, when you
feel that your
career's been determined for you
and you're

40:45.343 --> 40:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not progressing any further,
it's incredibly
ungratifying.

40:48.413 --> 40:51.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In other words, you
hit the glass
ceiling.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Yes.

40:52.984 --> 40:57.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Her husband
remained in finance,
but Sherry became a writer. Her
first book,

40:57.655 --> 41:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a children's mystery, was
inspired by her
New York apartment, where clues
to solve an

41:03.528 --> 41:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elaborate scavenger hunt are
hidden in the
walls.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Here, go ahead.
Take that
picture. Do you know what this
is, by the

41:09.567 --> 41:10.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way?

41:10.268 --> 41:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's Dr. Seuss.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: Dr. Seuss.

41:12.603 --> 41:14.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's
Sylvester McMonkey
McBean. Sneetches. Those are
Sneetches.

41:14.305 --> 41:14.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:15.006 --> 41:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: You're right.

41:16.774 --> 41:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Behind each one is a replica of
a room in
the apartment. They fit
together, and behind

41:21.312 --> 41:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every single one of these, you
could build
out a whole house.

41:23.614 --> 41:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The mother of four
had ample
distractions, but Sherry kept
dwelling on

41:28.753 --> 41:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her more than a decade on Wall
Street.

41:30.888 --> 41:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: If you can't get
the story
out of your head, and can't let
it go, you

41:35.026 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to put it to paper.

41:36.427 --> 41:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's what it
was for you?
You couldn't let it go?

41:39.230 --> 41:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN SHERRY: I couldn't let
it go. I tried.
It still bothered me. I just
wanted to sort

41:44.001 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of discuss, to let you see
through the lens
of a woman what it's like to
work in a place

41:48.840 --> 41:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like that, what it feels like.

41:50.675 --> 41:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What it felt like
from 1989 to
the year 2000, and apparently
what it still

41:57.482 --> 41:59.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feels a lot like today.

"PBS NewsHour" economics

Solman, reporting from New York.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a different
kind of read.

42:20.238 --> 42:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new memoir captures the grief

JEFFREY BROWN: For more than 35
years, radio
host Diane Rehm has tackled
pretty much every

42:37.455 --> 42:39.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
topic under the sun.

DIANE REHM, Author, "On My Own":
Already,
hundreds of Syrians have been
killed.

JEFFREY BROWN: Her two-hour
daily public radio
program produced by WMAU in
Washington, D.C.,

42:49.734 --> 42:53.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reaches some 2.5 million
listeners nationwide.

42:53.371 --> 42:59.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now in a new book titled "On My
Own," she's
addressing a more personal an
raw topic, the

42:59.277 --> 43:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death of her husband John after
54 years of
marriage. John was dying owed
with Parkinson's

43:05.249 --> 43:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disease in 2005 and moved into
an assisted
living facility in 2012.

43:11.122 --> 43:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years later, in steady
decline, he decided
to end his life. But with
doctors legally

43:16.461 --> 43:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
barred from assisting, his only
option was
to refuse food, liquids and
medication. His

43:21.799 --> 43:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death came 10 days later. Diane
Rehm lives
alone now with her dog Maxie and
with lingering

43:28.372 --> 43:31.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
grief and anger over her
husband's last days.

43:31.409 --> 43:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: I so resented that
John was having
to go through this long 10-day
process to

43:40.318 --> 43:50.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
die. He had said 10 days earlier
he was ready
to die, and it took him that
long. It shouldn't

43:50.127 --> 43:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have, I don't believe, taken him
that long.

43:53.831 --> 43:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write: "I
rage at a system
that wouldn't allow John to be
helped toward

43:58.069 --> 43:59.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his own death."

43:59.837 --> 44:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He knew what he was going
through. You two
had talked this through, and he
just wanted

44:03.908 --> 44:05.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to let it happen.

44:05.610 --> 44:15.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANE REHM: He wanted to
relinquish life.
He didn't commit suicide. He
wanted to let

44:15.152 --> 44:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go of life and be on to the next
journey.

44:19.090 --> 44:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You and he had
talked a lot
about these kind of end-of-life
matters. Right?

44:22.927 --> 44:24.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE REHM: Absolutely.

44:24.795 --> 44:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That is one of
the things that
comes through in the book, is
that that helped

44:27.932 --> 44:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you in some degree. Right? Even
as hard as
it was, you had talked it
through.

44:32.803 --> 44:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Even after he said,
I'm ready,
I'm ready to die, I said to him,
sweetheart,

44:42.647 --> 44:47.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are you sure? Is this really
what you want?

44:47.218 --> 44:56.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, absolutely. I can
no longer use
my hands. I cannot walk. I
cannot feed myself.

44:56.928 --> 45:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I cannot do anything for myself.
I am ready
to die.

45:02.667 --> 45:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the things
I'm sure
will resonate with a lot of
people, you refer

45:06.203 --> 45:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to is the capital-G guilt that
you felt along
the way, right, as you were
moving toward

45:12.343 --> 45:12.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this point.

45:13.010 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

45:13.711 --> 45:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... the guilt?

45:14.512 --> 45:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Of course, of
course.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

45:16.747 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: How could I not feel
guilt? I
think every spouse who sees
another go into

45:29.193 --> 45:34.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an assisted living facility must
experience
some of that.

45:34.599 --> 45:43.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I had stayed home, if I had
given up my
work, if I had cared for him
here at home,

45:43.808 --> 45:51.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perhaps he would have lived at
least a few
months longer. I'm not sure that
is the case.

45:51.282 --> 46:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was the guilt I felt. We
take vows
when we marry, for better, for
worse, in sickness,

46:00.391 --> 46:02.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in health.

46:02.293 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fifty-four-year
marriage, right,
which you write about very
honestly. You write

46:06.430 --> 46:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about periods of joy and of
partnership, certainly,
but also, as you say, years of
hostility,

46:13.170 --> 46:16.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
endless periods of silence. Why
did you write
about that?

46:16.641 --> 46:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Because I believe
that no marriage
is perfect.

46:24.281 --> 46:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet so many of us go into
marriage or
partnership or relationship
believing that

46:34.158 --> 46:41.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all is going to be sunny, all is
going to
be wonderful. I wish, Jeff, I
had been more

46:41.966 --> 46:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mature, because John needed more
distance
than I did. John needed more
quiet time than

46:50.841 --> 46:58.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did. I love to be with people.
John's greatest
solace was being alone.

46:58.282 --> 47:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, in the end,
in his last
days, was there a kind of
understanding?

47:03.020 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE REHM: Totally.

47:05.089 --> 47:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there was such closeness
in those
last three weeks, four weeks
before he died.

47:15.099 --> 47:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, out of
this experience,
you have become a much more
active advocate,

47:21.072 --> 47:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess, right, for the right to
die. That
sets you in the middle of a very
passionate

47:25.976 --> 47:26.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debate in this country.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANE REHM: I appreciate both
sides.

47:29.914 --> 47:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am arguing not that everyone
should feel
as I do and ask for death when
the time comes.

47:40.991 --> 47:52.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand those who would
prefer to give
and receive palliative care.
Total individual

47:52.036 --> 48:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice. But do not let the law
prevent me
from making my choice about my
own life.

48:01.145 --> 48:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Becoming so
public about it
also brought you some questions
and criticism

48:05.983 --> 48:07.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from your organization, right?

48:07.051 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE REHM: Exactly.

48:08.919 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Whether you are
now an advocate
or your more traditional role as
a journalist,

48:12.790 --> 48:14.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

48:14.625 --> 48:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Once I leave the
microphone, then
I will become, as you say, an
advocate. Right

48:22.800 --> 48:33.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, I am advocating for myself.
I am not
advocating for any organization
in particular

48:33.778 --> 48:42.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or any change in any state law
in particular.
I am advocating for myself.

48:42.153 --> 48:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're now,
as the book
says, on your own...

48:45.489 --> 48:46.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DIANE REHM: Yes.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... for the first
time in many,
many, many years, right?

48:48.325 --> 48:49.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Yes, all my life.

48:49.326 --> 48:50.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Except for Maxie.

48:50.628 --> 48:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Except for Maxie,
who is my constant
companion.

48:55.866 --> 49:01.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talk to Maxie. I talk to John,
and John
talks back to me.

49:01.972 --> 49:04.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. That
conversation hasn't
stopped, huh?

49:04.775 --> 49:10.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: It hasn't stopped. I
don't think
it will stop. And it really
helps me.

49:10.748 --> 49:15.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have also
announced that
you will stop doing your radio
program at

49:15.085 --> 49:15.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the end of this year.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANE REHM: At the end of the
year.

49:17.087 --> 49:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I wonder if --
are the two
related?

49:19.089 --> 49:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: I had decided that,
since I am
currently 79 -- I will be 80 in
September

49:30.201 --> 49:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that 80 was a good point to
step away from
the microphone I have held daily
for 37 years.

49:41.712 --> 49:52.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems to me that there ought
to be other,
fresher voices, newer ideas,
newer plans for

49:52.122 --> 49:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a national program like mine.
And I think
I would welcome that change.

49:58.729 --> 50:01.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right. The
book is "On
My Own."

50:01.432 --> 50:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diane Rehm, thanks so much for
letting us
come.

50:05.102 --> 50:14.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIANE REHM: Jeff, thank you.

50:14.812 --> 50:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, another
installment of
our weekly series Brief But
Spectacular.

50:24.755 --> 50:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, unleashing your inner
beast from singer-songwriter
Thao Nguyen of the group Thao
and the Get

50:31.762 --> 50:33.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Down Stay Down.

50:33.697 --> 50:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her latest album, "A Man Alive,"
will be released
tomorrow. And she will be
touring cross-country

50:38.702 --> 50:40.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starting this month.

50:40.504 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THAO NGUYEN, Musician: I taught
myself how
to do this when I was riding the
bus to school.

50:50.180 --> 51:00.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Push it.

51:00.658 --> 51:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did teach myself the guitar
and various
other string instruments. It's a
technique

51:06.830 --> 51:13.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called fake it until you make
it. I could
give a seminar, really. You
know, my interest

51:13.137 --> 51:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a live -- in putting on a
live show is
connecting with people there.

51:17.007 --> 51:22.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a pretty reserved person in
my real life,
in my non-working life, but
then, when I get

51:22.780 --> 51:36.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on stage, it's an opportunity to
tap into
this beast? It's the most
present I will ever

51:36.527 --> 51:41.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be in my life. We want people to
know that
when they come to the show, they
can come

51:41.799 --> 51:44.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with us. We can go somewhere
together.

51:44.635 --> 51:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To be an Asian-American woman,
there's that
kind of meekness and timidness
and submission

51:51.408 --> 51:59.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is expected of you. I know
that I embody
probably the least threatening
physical form

51:59.450 --> 52:05.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you could. That's true. That's
real. That's
-- you know, I'm like -- I'm
tiny. I understand.

52:05.422 --> 52:10.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have such love for the
audience, but, also,
I'm like, I will eat you. I want
people to

52:10.427 --> 52:17.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see how little I care about
showing that side.
When I was growing up, I didn't
really have

52:17.067 --> 52:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
freedom of expression. And there
was no one
entirely interested in what I
was saying or

52:22.706 --> 52:24.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thinking.

52:24.408 --> 52:26.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point is that you're fed and
that you
have shelter and do well in
school. But it

52:27.011 --> 52:32.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't until I got on stage
where I realized,
it just sort of -- I could tap
into without

52:32.249 --> 52:35.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even wanting to. It just sort of
overtook
me.

52:35.285 --> 52:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now I can tame the beast a
little bit, enough
so that I can only do it for
work. To be that

52:41.658 --> 52:55.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
open and vulnerable and to have
crazy eyes
and to be sometimes snarling or
just screaming,

52:55.139 --> 52:59.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's important for me to share
that part,
you know, because, you know, I
think it's

52:59.676 --> 53:01.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
healthy for the both of us.

53:01.345 --> 53:07.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Thao Nguyen, and this is my
Brief But
Spectacular take on the beast
within.

53:07.184 --> 53:12.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
other episodes
of our Brief But Spectacular
series on our

53:12.723 --> 53:15.292 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Facebook page,
Facebook.com/NewsHour.

53:15.325 --> 53:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online: a new
study of the
genes behind our hair could help
explain why

53:23.233 --> 53:30.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it turns gray, thins or grows
between our
eyebrows. Geneticists at
University College

53:30.174 --> 53:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
London identified genes that, in
theory, could
help researchers develop ways to
stop unwanted

53:36.780 --> 53:40.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growth and for some to promote
hair growth
where it's needed.

53:40.751 --> 53:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can read what else they
found on our home
page. All that and more is on
our Web site,

53:46.356 --> 53:49.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PBS.org/NewsHour. It's all
there.

53:49.660 --> 53:51.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

53:51.862 --> 53:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
David Brooks.

53:56.800 --> 54:06.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

54:06.910 --> 54:15.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
