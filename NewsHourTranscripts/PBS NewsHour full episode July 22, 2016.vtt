shifts to the Democrats, and
Hillary Clinton's

00:12.012 --> 00:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick for vice president, after
Donald Trump
pledges to bring law and order
to a nation

00:17.584 --> 00:20.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he sees afflicted by crime and
violence.

00:20.554 --> 00:26.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: the desperate journey of
women and children
on the seas off the Libyan
coast, risking

00:26.927 --> 00:28.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it all for a better life.

00:28.996 --> 00:34.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: They are all crying. The
kids are screaming.
They're babies. And the women
seem quite in

00:35.035 --> 00:36.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shock.

00:36.870 --> 00:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Mark Shields
and David
Brooks analyze American
politics, with one

00:41.174 --> 00:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
convention down and one to go.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

00:50.984 --> 01:02.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's been a
mass killing
in Germany tonight.

01:02.396 --> 01:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As many as three gunmen shot
dead eight people
in Munich. Police say a ninth
body may be

01:08.268 --> 01:14.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an attacker. It happened at a
McDonald's and
in a shopping mall in the
Bavarian capital.

01:14.875 --> 01:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police swarmed to the scene as
gunfire erupted.
Dozens of people ran, and
authorities warned

01:20.547 --> 01:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civilians to stay inside as they
searched
the area.

01:24.685 --> 01:30.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the U.S., Democratic
presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton voiced
solidarity with Germany.

01:30.857 --> 01:37.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump said the
U.S. must
do all it can to ward off
terrorism.

01:37.164 --> 01:41.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans have all but packed
up and cleared
out of Cleveland, and now the
Democrats get

01:41.535 --> 01:46.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their chance in Philadelphia.
The focus today
shifted to anticipation of
Hillary Clinton's

01:47.074 --> 01:53.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choice of a vice presidential
running mate
and new controversial comments
by Donald Trump.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:55.949 --> 02:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary Clinton
spent the
day campaigning in Florida, as
reports swirled

02:00.887 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about how she's filling out the
Democratic
ticket.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First a roundtable in Orlando,
later, a rally
in Tampa.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Did anyone watch the convention
in Cleveland?

02:07.928 --> 02:09.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:09.863 --> 02:15.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It's
hard to believe
they spent so much time talking
about me and

02:15.235 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no time talking about jobs or
education or
health care.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:21.475 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All of this
amid reports
that Virginia Senator Tim Kaine
is the favorite

02:25.679 --> 02:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the vice presidential nod.
Kaine is a
current senator and a popular
former governor

02:30.250 --> 02:35.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Virginia, a key swing state,
and he was
one of Clinton's earliest
backers, even before

02:35.889 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she formally announced her
candidacy.

02:38.258 --> 02:41.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He explained why on MSNBC in May
of 2014.

02:41.828 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TIM KAINE (D), Virginia:
She has the
best experience, both
domestically and internationally.

02:47.768 --> 02:53.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has got the accumulated
backbone, wisdom,
judgment, scar tissue from a
long period in

02:53.607 --> 02:57.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public life to be the best
president of the
United States beginning in 2017.

02:57.978 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Kaine speaks
Spanish fluently,
and recently campaigned with
Clinton in Virginia.

03:04.317 --> 03:09.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also familiar with the
national stage.
Then Senator Barack Obama eyed
him as a possible

03:10.057 --> 03:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
running mate back in 2008.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After his election, he named
Kaine to chair
the Democratic National
Committee.

03:16.296 --> 03:20.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Tim and I share a philosophy.
It's a pragmatic,

03:20.367 --> 03:24.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
progressive philosophy. It's a
philosophy
that measures the strength an
idea, not by

03:24.905 --> 03:29.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's Republican or
Democrat, but whether
it can actually solve a problem
and make a

03:29.176 --> 03:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
difference in people's lives.

03:31.078 --> 03:35.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Others on
Clinton's short
list include Agriculture
Secretary Tom Vilsack,

03:35.882 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor Secretary Tom Perez, New
Jersey Senator
Cory Booker, and Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth

03:41.755 --> 03:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Warren, a leading progressive
voice in the
party.

03:44.958 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Choosing Kaine might rankle
supporters of
Clinton's primary rival, Bernie
Sanders, and

03:49.996 --> 03:55.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so might some of Kaine's views.
A Catholic,
he personally opposes abortion,
but supports

03:55.569 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Supreme Court decision
legalizing it.

03:58.572 --> 04:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, he supports U.S.
trade deals,
including NAFTA and the
Trans-Pacific Partnership.

04:04.177 --> 04:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats also have to figure
out how to hold
on to Kaine's Senate seat if he
becomes vice

04:08.915 --> 04:10.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this comes immediately after
Republican
nominee Donald Trump wrapped up
his party's

04:14.254 --> 04:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention in Cleveland. Today,
he thanked
organizers and supporters a
final time, as

04:19.126 --> 04:23.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he dismissed the Democrats' veep
selection
process, and their coming
gathering in Philadelphia.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary's trying to pick her
vice president

04:26.800 --> 04:31.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as fast as possible, because she
wants to
take away a little of the
success that we

04:31.171 --> 04:36.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had at this convention. Nobody
is going to
watch this next convention
coming. Who's going

04:36.476 --> 04:44.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to? I'm going to have a hard
time watching
her final speech. Number one, I
know her too

04:44.618 --> 04:46.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
well. Number two, boring.

04:46.653 --> 04:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But even with
the nomination
firmly in hand, Trump took on
his former opponent,

04:51.324 --> 04:55.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who
pointedly refused
to endorse him during his
convention speech

04:56.096 --> 04:57.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wednesday.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't want his
endorsement.
If he gives it, I will not
accept it, just

05:01.001 --> 05:05.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so you understand. If he gives
it, I will
not accept it. It won't matter.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:07.174 --> 05:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Honestly, he
should've done
it because nobody cares and he
would've been

05:11.545 --> 05:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in better shape for four years
from now.

05:13.446 --> 05:18.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump suggested
he might
set up a super PAC to oppose any
future presidential

05:18.418 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bid by Cruz.

05:21.922 --> 05:26.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, President Obama
took his own
shot at Trump and the tone of
the GOP convention.

05:26.359 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The one thing that
I think is
important to recognize is this
idea that America

05:37.370 --> 05:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is somehow on the verge of
collapse, this
vision of violence and chaos
everywhere, doesn't

05:48.181 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really jibe with the experience
of most people.

05:50.584 --> 05:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
is expected
to speak in support of Hillary
Clinton at

the Democratic Convention in
Philadelphia
on Wednesday.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa

JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Obama denied today that the U.S.
knew in advance

06:05.999 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the coup attempt in Turkey
or had any
involvement. He also said that
Turkey's request

06:11.238 --> 06:17.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to extradite opposition cleric
Fethullah Gulen
from the U.S. will go through
proper channels.

06:17.911 --> 06:22.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he voiced concerns about
thousands of
Turks being arrested, and
thousands more being

06:23.016 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired from government jobs in a
sweeping purge
since the failed coup one week
ago.

Back in this country, former Ku

leader David Duke announced that
he's running,

06:34.928 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a Republican, for the U.S.
Senate in Louisiana.
He said the climate of this
country has moved

06:41.167 --> 06:44.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in his direction, and he
elaborated in a video
statement.

DAVID DUKE (R), Louisiana
Senatorial Candidate:
I'm overjoyed to see Donald
Trump and most

06:49.009 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans embrace most of the
issues that
I have championed for years. My
slogan remains

06:54.948 --> 07:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America first. The time is now.
A revolution
is coming in the United States
of America.

07:01.154 --> 07:06.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
leaders quickly
announced that they will oppose
Duke's bid.

07:06.126 --> 07:11.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It comes amid heightened
tensions over the
police killing of a black man in
Baton Rouge

07:11.398 --> 07:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a separate attack that
killed three police
officers.

07:15.001 --> 07:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first funeral was held today
in Baton
Rouge for one of the officers
killed last

07:19.439 --> 07:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sunday. Hundreds of mourners
attended a service

joined the Baton

ago, after 11
years in the military.

07:29.049 --> 07:33.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARL DABADIE, Baton Rouge Police
Chief: It's
hard to say goodbye to a good
man, to capture

07:33.520 --> 07:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in words, not just the facts and
the dates
that make a life, but the
essential truth

07:39.459 --> 07:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that person, their private
joys and sorrows.
How much harder to do it for
someone who protected

07:47.133 --> 07:49.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and served both with honor and
dignity.

07:50.003 --> 07:54.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Funerals for the

today alleging a $1 billion
Medicare and Medicaid

08:00.814 --> 08:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

The league cited
the state's law barring

08:31.177 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and limiting anti-discrimination

decision."

08:38.251 --> 08:43.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. PAT MCCRORY (R), North
Carolina: I think
it sets a dangerous precedent,
where a corporation

08:43.990 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can demand a quid pro quo, and
in return for
that quid pro quo on legislative
policy, they

08:53.833 --> 08:58.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will bring their service. And if
they don't
do it, they will deny their
service.

08:58.972 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of top

The Nasdaq rose 26 points, and

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the strategy
behind Hillary Clinton's V.P.
pick; how the

09:31.104 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
deck is stacked against
residents of the Mississippi
Delta; the women and children
risking their

09:36.910 --> 09:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lives on the Mediterranean; and
much more.

09:51.524 --> 09:56.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now a closer look at the
Democratic ticket
and the strategy behind Hillary
Clinton's

09:56.162 --> 09:59.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
potential coming vice
presidential pick.

09:59.532 --> 10:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn to longtime Democratic
consultant
Hilary Rosen, who joins us from
Philadelphia,

10:03.970 --> 10:06.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the site of next week's
convention.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hilary, Hilary Rosen, welcome.

10:09.409 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what are your sources and
what do your
instincts tell you?

10:13.513 --> 10:19.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HILARY ROSEN, Democratic
Consultant: Well,
my instinct tell me that
Democrats are ready

10:19.419 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this convention. There is a
big contrast
that we're excited to have
between the sort

10:25.391 --> 10:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hostile and pessimistic show
that the Republicans
put on this past week in
Cleveland and the

10:31.030 --> 10:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
optimism that Democrats are
going to feel
this week.

10:34.567 --> 10:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for all the
speculation
right now, and there's been a
lot of it, so

10:39.839 --> 10:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much of it seems to be directed
at Virginia
Governor -- or Senator, I should
say, former

10:45.211 --> 10:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor and now Senator Tim
Kaine. What do
you think about that? What would
be the calculation

10:49.883 --> 10:51.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a Tim Kaine choice?

10:51.818 --> 10:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILARY ROSEN: Tim Kaine's been
governor. He's
been a senator, as you just
said. He's been

10:56.022 --> 11:01.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee.
He knows a lot about domestic
policy. He's

11:01.528 --> 11:03.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a fluent Spanish speaker.

11:04.063 --> 11:08.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would be an excellent pick
for Hillary
Clinton. He checks a lot of
boxes. Virginia's

11:08.868 --> 11:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a battleground state. One thing
that's interesting
about this V.P. selection over
the last 10

11:17.510 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
days, I have noticed with
Democrats contrasting
with the Republicans, is,
Democrats are not

11:22.749 --> 11:29.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very sort of hostile or
energetic around which
one of these top-tier candidates
Hillary Clinton

11:29.422 --> 11:31.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
picks.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think there is a lot of
enthusiasm for her
and, frankly, people are giving
her leeway

11:34.494 --> 11:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pick the V.P. that she wants
to govern
with.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what would
be -- say,
if it were -- and, again, we're
speculating

11:40.466 --> 11:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now -- we don't know -- but if
it were a Tim
Kaine, what would the pluses be
for her and

11:45.872 --> 11:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what would the liabilities be?

11:47.807 --> 11:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILARY ROSEN: So, he's, you
know, a white
guy, a little boring. You know,
we have talked

11:55.949 --> 12:00.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Latinos. We have talked
about other
women. We have talked about
African-Americans.

12:00.920 --> 12:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of enthusiasm
around having
a person of color on the ticket
or another

12:07.694 --> 12:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman. You know, so that's the
downside, is
that maybe people say, well, is
she playing

12:13.733 --> 12:15.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it safe?

12:15.635 --> 12:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, I think that
you get in
Tim Kaine a really thoughtful
policy leader

12:19.706 --> 12:27.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and somebody who she gets
enthusiastic about.
So much of this has to be about
how Hillary

12:27.180 --> 12:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton feels every day when she
wakes up
and has a partner in governing.
And so I think

12:32.485 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Democrats are going to give
her kind
of the benefit of the doubt
there.

12:36.356 --> 12:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're Hillary Clinton,
you want someone
you know and feel comfortable
with and feel

12:42.328 --> 12:44.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aligned with.

12:44.297 --> 12:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hilary Rosen,
it's been pointed
out that she has known Tom
Vilsack, the former

12:48.201 --> 12:54.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
governor of Iowa, now the
secretary of agriculture,
even longer, has a closer
relationship -- as

12:54.407 --> 12:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we say, known him longer, closer
relationship
with him. Why wouldn't a Tom
Vilsack make

12:59.712 --> 13:01.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sense?

13:01.581 --> 13:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILARY ROSEN: You know, this is
-- I haven't
talked to Secretary Clinton
about this.

13:06.719 --> 13:17.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My view is that maybe he's a
little old, that
he doesn't bring the kind of
diverse constituency

13:17.630 --> 13:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a Tim Kaine brings with his
experience
in the Latino community. And
Iowa is a smaller

13:24.871 --> 13:28.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state. It is a battleground
state, but it
has fewer electoral votes than
Virginia does.

13:28.875 --> 13:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're going to go for
balance, if
you're going for the middle of
the country,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shoot at a bigger state.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hilary Rosen, we
talk a lot
about whether the vice
presidential pick makes

13:38.918 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a difference. How do you see
that in this
election year running against
Donald Trump?

13:43.356 --> 13:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILARY ROSEN: You know, I think
that sort
of the polls always say that
people vote for

13:49.462 --> 13:51.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president, not the vice
president.

13:51.597 --> 13:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is something about the
vice presidential
pick in every presidential
campaign, because

13:57.170 --> 14:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's kind of the first important
decision
that these nominees make. And so
what goes

14:03.209 --> 14:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into that decision, how they
talk about, how
they justify it, the kinds of
character that

14:08.481 --> 14:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're looking for, that does
matter.

14:11.017 --> 14:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that Trump picked Mike
Pence, for
someone like me, he's way too
conservative.

14:16.789 --> 14:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He only appeals to a limited
base. On the
other hand, it was a solid, safe
pick for

14:23.262 --> 14:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump. So, that says
something about
him, that he was serious, he
wasn't going

14:27.834 --> 14:29.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to play games.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, with Hillary Clinton,
people are
looking for, you know, will she
govern from

14:33.673 --> 14:38.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- with solid progressive
values, but try
and appeal to the middle of the
country? Will

14:38.711 --> 14:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she go to independents? Can she
even get moderate
Republicans, or is she just
trying to make

14:43.983 --> 14:45.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a statement pick?

14:45.852 --> 14:50.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that Tim Kaine
offers a little
bit of both for Hillary Clinton.
So, I think,

14:51.057 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, it's not going to make
people vote
for her or not vote for her, but
it is going

14:55.461 --> 14:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say something about what
she's looking
for in character.

14:57.897 --> 15:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It will tell us a
little bit
more once we know what it is,
and everybody

15:02.201 --> 15:03.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is waiting.

15:03.402 --> 15:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hilary Rosen in Philadelphia,
thanks very
much.

15:09.208 --> 15:18.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HILARY ROSEN: Take care.

15:18.651 --> 15:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While all eyes
were on Ohio
this week, we look now at
another Cleveland,

15:28.261 --> 15:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this one in the Mississippi
Delta, where poverty
and economic mobility are worse
than anywhere

15:33.599 --> 15:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else in the developed world.

15:35.568 --> 15:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This report is part of our
series How the
Deck is Stacked. It's funded by
the Corporation

15:40.573 --> 15:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Public Broadcasting and a
collaboration
from American Public Media's
Marketplace,

15:46.245 --> 15:49.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and PBS' "Frontline" and the
"NewsHour."

15:49.115 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kai Ryssdal of Marketplace has
the story.

15:53.152 --> 16:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: The Mississippi
Delta is known
for music and for juke joints
like this one,

16:05.064 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and for rich agricultural land.

16:07.800 --> 16:14.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cotton was once the main crop
here, now mostly
corn. Despite how fertile the
ground is here,

16:14.173 --> 16:18.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one in five households live
below the poverty
line, and, in fact, Mississippi
is ranked

16:18.811 --> 16:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50th out of 50 states by poverty
rate; 68-year-old
Catherine Wilson has lived here
her whole

16:24.984 --> 16:26.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

16:26.752 --> 16:31.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE WILSON, Mississippi:
Back then,
in the '60s, just like we had to
move from

16:31.257 --> 16:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home to home because we didn't
have enough
to eat, enough money to survive
on.

16:35.661 --> 16:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: In 1964, President
Johnson introduced
legislation to deal with a
national poverty

16:41.500 --> 16:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate that was almost 20 percent.
It became
known as the war on poverty.
Jobs training,

16:47.573 --> 16:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adult education and loans were
all part of
the plan.

16:50.643 --> 16:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In April of 1967, Senator Robert
Kennedy visited
the Delta to have a look for
himself at how

16:55.882 --> 16:57.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bad the poverty was.

16:57.783 --> 17:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is 1967. That's Bobby
Kennedy right
there. And who is that lady in
the striped

17:04.957 --> 17:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dress? Yes. Pretty good, huh.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATHERINE WILSON: That's good.

17:07.793 --> 17:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: That's a smile,
right? Do you
remember that?

17:09.262 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CATHERINE WILSON: Yes, I
remember the day
he came, all right.

17:12.832 --> 17:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: What did he want to
know? What
did he ask you about?

17:16.769 --> 17:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE WILSON: Asking about
what did we
want to see done. They said they
want jobs

17:22.708 --> 17:24.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and housing.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Blacks in the Delta
had historically
worked the land, but
mechanization and pesticides

17:28.547 --> 17:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meant fewer jobs and less money.

17:30.449 --> 17:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE WILSON: We have come a
long ways
since back then. We were so poor
and struggling,

17:36.756 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we didn't have anything. But
right now, a
lot of people have got jobs.
They couldn't

17:41.761 --> 17:43.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get no jobs back then.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Catherine Wilson
lives alone
in a place called Freedom
Village, built originally

17:47.867 --> 17:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to house those displaced farm
workers.

17:50.136 --> 17:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peter Edelman was an aide to
Bobby Kennedy.
He was with him on that 1967
trip to the Delta.

17:54.340 --> 17:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER EDELMAN, Former Aide to
Robert Kennedy:
He said to me as we went from
one house to

17:59.278 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next that he -- this was
worse than anything
he'd ever seen in a Third World
country.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Marian Wright had
been working
in the Delta, opening Head Start
offices to

18:07.920 --> 18:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help low-income families. She's
the one who
convinced Kennedy to come to
Mississippi.

18:12.925 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a little bit of romance
in this story.
Marian Wright and Peter Edelman
met on that

18:17.830 --> 18:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trip to the Delta. They have
been married
for almost 40 years. Marian
Wright Edelman

18:22.335 --> 18:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went on to create the Children's
Defense Fund.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Catherine Wilson, meanwhile, did
get some
education and training from
programs that

18:28.407 --> 18:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grew out of the war on poverty.
But the economy
today isn't the same economy
that we had half-a-century

18:33.546 --> 18:35.214 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER EDELMAN: What has happened
over the
last 40 years is that we have
had a major

18:38.317 --> 18:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change in our economy. Good jobs
have gone
to technology, to globalization.
And the consequence

18:46.926 --> 18:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that half of our population
is not earning
enough to support their
families, and a whole

18:53.265 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of them can't find jobs at
all.

18:55.701 --> 18:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Catherine Wilson's
had a whole
series of part-time jobs, but
she's never

18:59.705 --> 19:03.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
made much money. She has
survived mostly on
government assistance. She's now
on Social

19:04.010 --> 19:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security now; 22 percent of the
people in
Mississippi rely on food stamps.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Some things have gotten
better. We
have got a middle class that
wasn't there.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: But there's still
lots missing.

19:14.086 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Over 80 percent of the
black children
in Mississippi cannot read or
compute at grade

19:19.191 --> 19:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level in 4th or 8th grade. What
is a child
going to do if they can't read
and compute

19:24.864 --> 19:26.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the most basic levels?

19:26.732 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: In Cleveland, those
basic levels
are determined, in part, by
literally what

19:31.270 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of the tracks you grew up
on. Economic
mobility, or the lack of it, is
plain to see.

19:37.109 --> 19:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate for whites
is 6 percent;
for African-Americans, it is 22
percent.

19:42.248 --> 19:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRAVIS CALVIN, Delta State
University Mobile
Music Lab: Our goal with this
project to promote

19:47.887 --> 19:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
racial healing in our community.

19:49.922 --> 19:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Travis Calvin runs
the Delta
State University Mobile Music
Lab. It's a

19:54.260 --> 19:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refurbished school bus outfitted
with a complete
recording studio.

19:57.496 --> 20:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRAVIS CALVIN: I grew up in
Clarksdale, Mississippi.
It's about 30 miles north of
here. Just like

20:03.469 --> 20:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Delta, it's rich in history,
rich in the
blues, rich in musical culture,
but a really

20:09.542 --> 20:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad town when it comes to crime
rate. I came
to Delta State, and it was my
way out. So

20:20.486 --> 20:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel like its my duty to pay
it forward.

20:22.388 --> 20:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: The program Travis
runs, it's
called Healing With a Groove,
focuses on young

20:26.592 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
men of color, guys like
16-year-old A'Midius
Sigle (ph).

20:29.762 --> 20:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would your life be like if
you hadn't
found this?

20:32.798 --> 20:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A'MIDIUS SIGLE, Student: I don't
know. I would
probably be in a world I don't
need to be

20:35.668 --> 20:38.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in. A lot of my friends, like,
they don't
do stuff they don't need to do.
That's why

20:38.771 --> 20:40.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't hang with some of them.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Mike Carr (ph) is
from the other
side of the tracks. He's a
public defender

20:43.542 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Cleveland.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CARR, Public Defender: It
was a wonderful
place to grow up, but I'm very
privileged,

20:48.080 --> 20:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all right? I grew up with two
parents that
were middle-class, that were
educated, that

20:54.987 --> 20:56.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
encouraged me.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Not all kids,
though, in this
town, have that same deal.
Right?

20:59.391 --> 21:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CARR: No, absolutely not. I
spend 70
percent of my practice dealing
with people

21:05.364 --> 21:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are at the bottom of the
barrel, in the
sense that they have not only
just financially

21:12.071 --> 21:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absolutely nothing, but just
emotionally they
also have absolutely nothing.

21:16.575 --> 21:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Nationwide, the
wealth gap between
white and black households has
grown dramatically

21:20.713 --> 21:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since the great recession.
According to a
report from the Pew Research
Center, White

21:24.750 --> 21:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
households have net worths 13
times higher
than black families do.

21:29.922 --> 21:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Cleveland, the median income
for a black
family is less than half of that
for a white

21:34.627 --> 21:36.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIMMY WILSON, Restaurant Owner:
We're still
divided, to a certain extent.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Do you feel it? Do
you feel it
everyday?

21:40.065 --> 21:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIMMY WILSON: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
But you can't
say nothing about it, you know?

21:43.802 --> 21:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Lifelong Cleveland
resident Jimmy
Wilson has owned this soul food
restaurant

21:47.706 --> 21:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 1994, once a meeting spot
for civil
rights activists and leaders
like Martin Luther

21:52.678 --> 21:54.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
King Jr.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIMMY WILSON: Right during the
civil rights
movement, all the people that
would come into

21:57.750 --> 22:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cleveland would meet here. It
was Lily's Cafe
back then.

22:01.320 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: When you look
around today, though,
at the young people in this
town, where do

22:05.357 --> 22:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they go when they get out of
high school?

22:07.326 --> 22:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIMMY WILSON: Most of them is in
the streets.
They don't go anywhere. They
into drug business,

22:13.399 --> 22:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there's no jobs here.
And because
there is no jobs, the education
standard is

22:19.305 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not where it needs to be to
entice companies
to want to come here.

22:23.809 --> 22:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: So, Bobby Kennedy
comes here
in 1967, right, almost 50 years
ago.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIMMY WILSON: Yes.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Has it been wasted
time?

22:32.918 --> 22:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIMMY WILSON: Has been wasted
time.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Catherine Wilson is
more optimistic.
She'd like to see freedom
village become a

22:38.824 --> 22:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
place to help those in need.

22:40.492 --> 22:43.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE WILSON: I ain't given
up Freedom
Village. I still believe.

22:43.996 --> 22:52.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: For the "PBS
NewsHour" in Cleveland,
Mississippi, this is Kai
Ryssdal.

22:52.271 --> 23:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:00.679 --> 23:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what top executive
Roger Ailes' sudden departure
from FOX News

23:06.452 --> 23:11.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
means for the world of
television; and Mark
Shields and David Brooks give
their take on

23:11.490 --> 23:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Donald Trump convention,
before heading
to Hillary Clinton's.

23:15.527 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Latest figures from
Save the Children
show that nearly 13,000 children
have been

23:22.067 --> 23:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rescued so far this year while
trying to cross
the Mediterranean from North
Africa to Italy.

23:28.140 --> 23:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of those, more than 11,000 are
unaccompanied
and under the age of 18.

23:33.846 --> 23:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the second of his reports
from the Aquarius,
a ship run by Doctors Without
Borders, or

23:39.285 --> 23:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MSF, and SOS Mediterranee,
special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant looks at the
plight of women

23:46.325 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and children on these high seas.

23:49.495 --> 23:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This serene
night watch on
the bridge of the Aquarius
marked the end

23:55.701 --> 24:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a week when strong winds and
high waves
had prevented rafts from
launching from the

24:00.406 --> 24:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libyan coast. But as the sea
calmed down,
a flotilla left the Libyan
beaches and this

24:05.077 --> 24:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
boat was quickly in trouble.

24:06.945 --> 24:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I think, at the moment,
it's reported
that 26 women and five children,
six of the

24:14.086 --> 24:15.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
26 women.

24:15.921 --> 24:22.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Initially,
rescuers thought
this woman wasn't breathing. One
day, these

24:22.695 --> 24:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
babies and toddlers will be told
just how
close they came to death. They
were soaked

24:29.835 --> 24:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in petrol from leaking canisters
for the outboard
engine.

24:32.104 --> 24:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mixed with saltwater, the fuel
causes serious
burns. The traffickers'
callousness extended

24:37.343 --> 24:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to denying the children life
jackets. Revived,
the patient was told to quickly
shower the

24:42.147 --> 24:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
petrol off her skin to avoid
burns.

24:44.750 --> 24:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: They are all crying. The
kids are screaming.
They're babies. And the women
seem quite in

24:51.657 --> 24:53.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shock.

24:53.792 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Still nauseous
from the fumes,
mothers, sisters, and daughters
were too overwhelmed

24:59.164 --> 25:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recognize that after enduring
the Sahara
Desert, the anarchy of Libya and
the capriciousness

25:04.837 --> 25:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the waves, they had just
stepped back through
the portal of humanity.

25:10.709 --> 25:15.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Everybody is infested
with fuel. The
smell of fuel is gigantic.
People are suffocating

25:15.948 --> 25:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the fumes. And people
are wet.
There's no food. There's no
water, and the

25:22.187 --> 25:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quality of the boat is far below
average.
So they're lucky.

25:30.162 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Within an hour
of being rescued,
Manuela, a 2-year-old, who was
always dancing

25:36.902 --> 25:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on land, is dancing again below
deck, testimony
to the resilience of children.

25:41.707 --> 25:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although too young to understand
the nature
of their salvation, the kids
instinctively

25:46.412 --> 25:52.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responded to the protective
atmosphere of
the air-conditioned women and
children's sanctuary,

25:52.551 --> 25:55.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
separated from the men.

25:56.054 --> 25:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International relief agencies
say they're
extremely concerned about the
major upswing

25:59.825 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the number of children who
are making this
most perilous of journeys. The
voyage between

26:04.596 --> 26:10.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey and Greece is bad enough,
but this
one is many, many, many times
worse. Among

26:10.602 --> 26:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those risking their lives are
unaccompanied
minors.

26:13.672 --> 26:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside, in one of the areas
behind me, there
are three boys who are less than
12 years

26:19.578 --> 26:26.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
old. And because of
international child protection
procedures, we're not able to
talk to them

26:26.652 --> 26:28.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about their ordeal.

26:28.654 --> 26:34.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MSF's coordinator on the
Aquarius, Ferry Schippers,
shares the views of the U.N.'s
children fund,

26:34.126 --> 26:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNICEF, that unaccompanied
minors face abuse,
exploitation and death every
step of their

26:39.465 --> 26:41.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
journey.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRY SCHIPPERS, Doctors Without
Borders:
They're exploited on shore,
forced to work

26:43.802 --> 26:50.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to earn some money to pay for
passage. It's
easier to force younger people
to do something.

26:50.642 --> 26:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're picked up by armed
individual groups,
unscrupulous men, and they are
put into so-called

26:59.651 --> 27:04.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
detention centers, old
factories, old warehouse.
They are beaten, mistreated.

27:04.656 --> 27:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Out on deck,
Manuela is reunited
with her father. In the
sanctuary, midwife

27:13.799 --> 27:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angi Perri is checking on the
pregnant mothers
and providing them with the
first basic health

27:18.570 --> 27:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care many of them have received
in months.

27:20.706 --> 27:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGI PERRI, Midwife: They are
tried. They
came with a lot of shock. They
were crying

27:24.977 --> 27:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all together. But after taking a
shower, we
reassured them that the
situation I think

27:31.216 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is very stable and very, very
nice.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: How lucky do
you think they
were?

27:35.387 --> 27:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGI PERRI: They were very, very
lucky because
the trip tonight was a trip that
we consider

27:41.727 --> 27:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risky, because the weather
wasn't really good
in the past days. Now they have
food. They

27:47.232 --> 27:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can recover very easily. So they
were lucky,
because the risk of traveling in
the sea with

27:54.373 --> 28:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rubber boat is very high
always. So this
is very nice. For me, I am very
happy today.

28:01.947 --> 28:06.652 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
MALCOLM BRABANT:
Twenty-seven-year-old Sophie
Agbo comes from Cameroon, a West
African country

28:06.752 --> 28:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has problems with the Boko
Haram Islamist
group, and also economic
hardship.

28:11.390 --> 28:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIE AGBO, Refugee: I left
Cameroon, because,
in Cameroon, there's not -- I
wanted to go

28:21.934 --> 28:26.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out to come and find -- to look
for my future.

28:26.204 --> 28:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Two hours after
being plucked
from the sea, she's had time to
reflect on

28:31.076 --> 28:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the dangers of the journey.

28:32.945 --> 28:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOPHIE AGBO: I don't know that I
can describe
it, but the journey was very
bad. But thank

28:41.019 --> 28:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
God for that. I just thank God,
because the
God that took me from Cameroon
to here, I

28:48.026 --> 28:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just appreciate, to give the
glory and honor
to him.

28:51.730 --> 28:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Maria from
Ivory Coast could
only give single-word answers
about her desperate

28:56.468 --> 29:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journey, but her mother, who
wanted to be
identified as Fatima, claimed
she has been

29:01.573 --> 29:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
calm throughout, fortified by
her faith.

29:03.942 --> 29:08.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FATIMA, Refugee (through
translator): When
I was at sea, I prayed to God to
allow us

29:08.680 --> 29:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to triumph and to save us. We
could not have
arrived without the help of the
savior. We

29:13.752 --> 29:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the savior, and we have
been saved.

29:16.288 --> 29:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But at the far
end of the
sanctuary, 22-year-old Aseman,
who is due

29:21.460 --> 29:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give birth to a son in two
months' time,
was more forthcoming. She had
traveled from

29:26.064 --> 29:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eritrea, sometimes described as
the North
Korea of Africa.

29:30.168 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ASEMAN, Refugee (through
translator): I am
so happy to be safely on board
this ship.

29:35.340 --> 29:40.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Recently, many Eritreans
capsized. About 700
or 800 came by wooden boat. A
lot of our brothers

29:40.379 --> 29:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sisters died. But we took a
small rubber
boat, which is very dangerous.

29:43.782 --> 29:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am so fortunate and happy to
survive. I
wouldn't advise anyone to risk
taking this

29:48.487 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journey because there are so
many problems.
But people are obliged to leave
their country,

29:53.058 --> 29:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they have no choice. If
the Eritrean
government were to introduce
democracy and

29:57.029 --> 30:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decent living standards, then it
would be
preferable to stay.

30:00.399 --> 30:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Their stay on
the Aquarius
ended quickly, as they were
transferred to

30:05.303 --> 30:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another boat that would take
them and other
migrants to Italy. Their gamble
paid off,

30:09.641 --> 30:11.410 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
just.

30:11.510 --> 30:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they face a battle for
acceptance in a
Europe that has no solutions to
the exodus

30:16.381 --> 30:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Africa. They leave behind a
sea that
for most Europeans is a holiday
paradise.

30:22.087 --> 30:24.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Out here, it's another world.

30:25.023 --> 30:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Malcolm Brabant
off the Libyan coast.

30:31.096 --> 30:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a big
shakeup in television
news, and a media and political
bombshell,

30:45.210 --> 30:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Roger Ailes is ousted as the
head of FOX
News.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

30:50.882 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It all unfolded
quickly, in
a matter of weeks, after former
FOX anchor

30:55.620 --> 31:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual
harassment
suit against Roger Ailes,
longtime head of

31:00.959 --> 31:02.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
FOX News.

31:02.894 --> 31:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ailes denied the charges. But
21st Century
Fox, the cable network's parent
company, hired

31:07.966 --> 31:13.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a law firm to conduct an
investigation. According
to Carlson's lawyers, 20 or more
other women

31:14.005 --> 31:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then came forward with claims
about Ailes'
conduct, including Megyn Kelly,
one of the

31:20.545 --> 31:22.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
network's star anchors.

31:22.581 --> 31:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Publicly, many other prominent
on-air personalities
at FOX, including Bill O'Reilly,
Sean Hannity,

31:28.820 --> 31:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Greta Van Susteren, backed
Ailes and said
they were unaware of any
inappropriate behavior.

31:34.893 --> 31:39.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rupert Murdoch issued a
statement late yesterday
without referring to the
harassment charges,

31:40.098 --> 31:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that: "Roger Ailes has
made a remarkable
contribution to our company and
our country.

31:45.971 --> 31:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roger shared my vision of a
great and independent
television organization and
executed it brilliantly

31:51.510 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over 20 great years."

31:54.412 --> 32:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roger Ailes, now 76, has been an
influential
figure for decades in Republican
politics,

32:00.385 --> 32:07.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an adviser and strategist to
Presidents
Nixon, Reagan and George H.W.
Bush. He created

32:07.325 --> 32:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FOX News 20 years ago and built
it into the
most-watched cable news channel.

32:11.797 --> 32:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIT HUME, FOX News: More news
is on the way,
fair, balanced and unafraid.

32:15.267 --> 32:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Promoted as an
alternative
to traditional mainstream media.
It has been

32:21.139 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge moneymaker for its parent
company,
and a target for critics of its
conservative

32:25.977 --> 32:27.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tone and team.

32:27.846 --> 32:31.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ailes said this in a 2004
interview with C-SPAN'S
Brian Lamb:

32:31.583 --> 32:33.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER AILES, Former FOX News
Executive: Well,
we have changed the business a
little bit.

32:33.385 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think FOX News has come on the
scene and
identified itself as fair and
balanced. We

32:39.591 --> 32:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to do that every day. I
think others,
instead of trying to get more
fair and balanced,

32:46.398 --> 32:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably are offended by that or
worried about
it.

32:49.668 --> 32:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rupert Murdoch
and his sons,
James and Lachlan, will now
decide on a successor

32:54.573 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Roger Ailes and the future of
the network
he built.

32:58.944 --> 33:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And joining me now, Jane Hall, a
journalism
professor at American University
who previously

33:03.782 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
served as a media reporter for
The Los Angeles
Times and commentator at FOX
News, and Ken

33:09.387 --> 33:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doctor, who writes on the media
business for
Politico and on his blog,
Newsonomics.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ken, let me start with you.

33:18.230 --> 33:24.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You watched this all unfold. Was
it the accumulation
of charges? What in the end led
to Roger Ailes

33:24.336 --> 33:25.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being ousted?

33:25.303 --> 33:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEN DOCTOR, Newsonomics: It was.
It was.

33:27.205 --> 33:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's an extraordinary event,
as you laid
out, and it's almost operatic to
have it happen,

33:32.744 --> 33:39.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the final parting, on the day of
the Trump
acceptance. It was a
culmination. It was clearly

33:39.684 --> 33:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a frat boy kind of culture that
has been characteristic
of FOX News for a long time, and
that's not

33:47.158 --> 33:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to change overnight.

33:49.394 --> 33:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So now the Murdochs are going to
have to face
that question. And we know the
Murdoch sons

33:53.732 --> 33:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are in charge of the business
for the first
time. Roger Ailes had kind of
pushed them

33:59.137 --> 34:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off. And they're going to have
to confront
both the workplace question of,
what kind

34:03.508 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of workplace is it? Is it a "Mad
Men" workplace
or a 20th century workplace? And
some significant

34:09.547 --> 34:11.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business issues ahead.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, before we
look ahead,
Jane Hall, why now? Because some
of this had

34:15.053 --> 34:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been out there. There was a
biography of Roger
Ailes by Gabe Sherman a few
years ago. What

34:20.292 --> 34:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do you see happening? What was
your reaction?

34:22.327 --> 34:24.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE HALL, American University
School of Communication:
Well, I think -- I hope that it
means that

34:24.362 --> 34:26.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world has changed.

34:26.264 --> 34:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The younger Murdochs didn't
particularly like
Roger Ailes, but I think the
fact that so

34:33.738 --> 34:38.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many women, including,
reportedly, Megyn Kelly
came forward -- Ailes has denied
this. And

34:39.077 --> 34:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have to say that, of course.

34:40.912 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with the accumulation of
these charges,
I think that this is not
something that you

34:46.384 --> 34:53.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can countenance in a modern
media organization.
He ruled and invented FOX News.
And I think

34:53.925 --> 34:57.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they do face the kinds of
challenges that
Ken is saying.

34:57.295 --> 35:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do hope it means that
someone would
be investigated, that they took
this seriously.

35:03.601 --> 35:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been so much a part of our
culture that
women who were sexually harassed
-- even go

35:10.175 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to Anita Hill's charges --
were not taken
seriously. So I'm hopeful this
means that

35:15.613 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even a powerful person can be
investigated
for this.

35:19.050 --> 35:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jane, you wrote
an op-ed today
in The New York Times.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JANE HALL: Yes.

35:24.122 --> 35:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you wrote of
FOX as a perfect
reflection of Ailes himself. In
what sense?

35:29.894 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In what sense did he come to
help shape political
discourse?

35:33.665 --> 35:40.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE HALL: Well, he is a
brilliant television
producer. And he created the
jazzy graphics

35:40.405 --> 35:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the screen. He hired Bill
O'Reilly. He
brought in a number of people.
He brought

35:45.510 --> 35:47.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Megyn Kelly on board.

35:47.379 --> 35:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a great eye for talent.
What I think
has happened is his fair and
balanced slogan

35:52.884 --> 36:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really not accurate. They
have pounded
home lines like government
takeover, Obama

36:00.525 --> 36:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is soft on terrorism, Hillary is
crooked.
As I said in the piece, I don't
think we would

36:05.030 --> 36:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have Donald Trump if we didn't
have Roger
Ailes.

36:08.366 --> 36:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the network is absolutely a
reflection
of his vision. The only other
person I can

36:13.004 --> 36:18.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think of is Roone Arledge, who
created ABC
News and ABC Sports, who has had
the same

36:18.209 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
kind of impact. He merged
politics, though,
and a kind of bifurcated
take-no-prisoners

36:23.982 --> 36:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
style that I think has hurt our
discourse.

36:26.051 --> 36:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, Ken
Doctor, come
back to this question of, what
happens next?

36:30.088 --> 36:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do key people stay? Does the
network change
course or change style?

36:35.226 --> 36:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN DOCTOR: Well, I think we
will have an
interview leader.

36:38.163 --> 36:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, when Rupert Murdoch
made his statement,
we actually had an 85-year-old
replacing a

36:44.369 --> 36:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
76-year-old, which has got to be
an interim
situation. FOX has to get
through the election.

36:49.407 --> 36:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is by far the number one
network. This
is its election. But that is
four months away.

36:54.245 --> 36:59.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we will see an interim
leader who
will come in there and soothe
the waters.

36:59.117 --> 37:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This company had the same issue,
Dow Jones,
just a couple of years ago. And
they did that,

37:03.455 --> 37:05.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and they did it well.

37:05.423 --> 37:11.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then they really have to
look, as we get
into 2017, of what's the nature
of cable news.

37:11.763 --> 37:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to see major
changes, as we're
seeing live-streaming of things
like the Republican

37:16.868 --> 37:21.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Convention all over the place.
We are going
to see other sites from BuzzFeed
and The New

37:21.606 --> 37:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York Times be able to do the
same thing that
FOX and CNN are doing.

37:25.610 --> 37:31.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course ,the business
model is changing
because the bundle, buying 250
channels and

37:31.649 --> 37:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paying a dollar a month for FOX,
which is
what most of us pay, is being
replaced.

37:36.588 --> 37:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. It's
changing, but,
Ken, no denying the success of
FOX News. Right?

37:42.060 --> 37:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN DOCTOR: Huge success, $1.5
billion a year
in profit, and that's 20 percent
of the profit

37:49.000 --> 37:50.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of 21st Century Fox.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are going to handle this
very carefully.
And they have got contracts
coming up for

37:54.873 --> 37:59.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some of their major
personalities. Let's remember
that four months ago Donald
Trump said to

37:59.978 --> 38:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody, well, if the election
doesn't work
out, there is Trump News
Network. And now

38:04.883 --> 38:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he can hire Roger Ailes to run
it.

38:06.751 --> 38:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Jane, just
in our last
minute here, 9.3 million viewers
last night,

38:11.523 --> 38:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had the highest viewership of
the convention
night last night.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE HALL: It did. They're still
a powerhouse.

38:16.995 --> 38:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will point out that their
average age has
been creeping up and it was
already in the

38:22.000 --> 38:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mid-60s. They are not growing a
younger audience.
And I think that is a problem.
And CNN used

38:29.841 --> 38:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to not do so well because they
didn't have
the true believer base. But they
have been

38:33.878 --> 38:35.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gaining on them.

38:35.947 --> 38:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a sure thing that they
will continue
to do this. They have a base
that is extraordinary.

38:39.384 --> 38:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just very
briefly, that
younger generation that you were
talking about

38:43.254 --> 38:48.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming in of leadership, do you
see any potential
change in its course, I mean,
for FOX News?

38:48.459 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JANE HALL: For FOX News?

38:50.428 --> 38:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard different theories.
One is they're
going to -- everybody who is
closely associated

38:54.165 --> 38:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him may leave. Maybe they
will bring
in somebody new. The fact that
he said he

38:59.237 --> 39:03.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was going to be an adviser, I
wouldn't be
surprised if he goes to work
with Donald Trump.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sort of created Donald Trump
inadvertently.
It may be a marriage we might
see.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

39:09.280 --> 39:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jane Hall, Ken Doctor, thank you
both very
much.

39:14.519 --> 39:19.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEN DOCTOR: Welcome.

39:19.958 --> 39:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to politics
now, and to
the analysis of Shields and
Brooks. That's

39:27.532 --> 39:32.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and New
York Times columnist David
Brooks.

39:32.103 --> 39:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we welcome both of you,
after four interesting
days in Cleveland together.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We can't get
enough of it.

39:38.109 --> 39:38.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:38.843 --> 39:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're right.

39:40.845 --> 39:45.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, everybody's speculating,
Mark Shields,
about Hillary Clinton's choice
for vice president.

39:45.450 --> 39:49.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, we just got word a few
minutes ago
that maybe she is going to tweet
about it

39:49.487 --> 39:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the next few minutes. We're
keeping an
eye on that.

39:52.690 --> 39:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meantime, what should we be
-- what do
we know at this point about what
she's thinking?

39:59.264 --> 40:01.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have insights that you
want to share
with us?

40:01.432 --> 40:03.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I do.

40:03.268 --> 40:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have in my pocket -- no,
Hillary Clinton
has emphasized that she is
afflicted with

40:10.508 --> 40:18.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or possessed of the
responsibility gene. And
that is that she takes a serious
responsibility

40:19.083 --> 40:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of her appointments and the
people around
her. And that's probably the
strongest argument

40:25.556 --> 40:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can be made for Tim Kaine,
the senator
from Virginia, who you tried --
you talked

40:34.899 --> 40:36.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Hilary Rosen.

40:36.768 --> 40:44.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I have no inside
information. And Bill
Clinton, of course, went off the
reservation,

40:44.742 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he has more than once, by
recommending
Tim Kaine , which probably may
put him in

40:50.415 --> 40:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jeopardy, because now it looks
like, if she
does pick him, that he somehow
would -- she

40:55.620 --> 41:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be bowing to the big
fellow's will or
direction or influence. I don't
know.

41:01.159 --> 41:05.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
what do your
direct sources in the Clinton
camp tell you?

41:05.296 --> 41:12.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
interesting to watch
the two candidacies go -- they
used to go

41:12.270 --> 41:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for geographical opposites or
ideological
opposites.

41:15.673 --> 41:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they are apparently going
for temperamental
opposites, because Donald Trump
picked a remarkably

41:20.211 --> 41:24.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nice guy in Mike Pence. And the
three people
who are most often talked about
with Hillary

41:24.215 --> 41:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, whether it's Tim Kaine
or Vilsack
or Cory Booker, they are three
extremely nice

41:31.689 --> 41:33.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

41:33.624 --> 41:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will have a tonal change
between the
presidential debates and the
vice presidential

41:36.227 --> 41:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debates which will blow your
mind. They are
all -- especially Kaine, sunny
dispositions,

41:42.200 --> 41:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
open personalities and extremely
likable.

41:46.871 --> 41:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as with the case of
Pence, giving
a little aurora of likability to
a candidate,

41:53.344 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lead candidate who's a little
lacking in
that department.

41:56.347 --> 42:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this is a
decision, Mark.
They say the choice of a vice
presidential

42:00.818 --> 42:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running mate doesn't make all
that much difference
in the outcome, but it does tell
you something

42:05.223 --> 42:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the thinking of the person
who is running
for president, doesn't it?

42:09.093 --> 42:10.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Absolutely, Judy.

42:11.095 --> 42:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And remember this. The person
you're choosing
is going to be 90 feet down the
hall for four

42:15.233 --> 42:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years. That's a pretty intimate
and close
relationship, and it better be
somebody you're

42:20.505 --> 42:24.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comfortable with, you like, you
trust, you
look forward to seeing, not
someone you're

42:25.076 --> 42:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming up with creative ideas on
how to avoid.

42:28.780 --> 42:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had one very prominent and
partisan Republican
say to me that he personally
hoped that Secretary

42:37.155 --> 42:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton would choose Tim Kaine.
And I asked
why. And they said because he'd
like one of

42:41.726 --> 42:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the four people running for vice
president
to be somebody he thought could
be president,

42:46.531 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which I thought was quite a
tribute and testimony
itself.

42:52.069 --> 42:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does tell you, I mean,
whether you're
comfortable. I think David's
point is a very

42:57.375 --> 43:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good one, that Mike Pence is a
sunny conservative.
I thought he had a good
convention. And I

43:05.183 --> 43:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that the people that are
publicly on
her short list all are very
congenial people.

43:13.891 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're not people with
personality or Captain
Queeg problems.

43:18.496 --> 43:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David, what would
you add to
that?

43:19.931 --> 43:21.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

43:21.799 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I agree, especially on
the plausible
president point. Kaine has been
obviously

43:25.703 --> 43:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a governor. He's been a senator.
He's one
of the smartest rising stars in
the Democratic

43:31.709 --> 43:34.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party. He is very plausible as
someone who
could sit in and be president.

43:34.846 --> 43:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim Stavridis is the former NATO
commander
who is sometimes on people's
lists, also very

43:39.317 --> 43:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plausible, self-possessed,
someone with sobriety.
And so there's so much
strangeness in this

43:45.556 --> 43:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. These are all people who
do seem relatively
normal, relatively stable and
warm, but not

43:52.330 --> 43:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without gravitas in their own
way.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, David, let
me stay with
you, because I was going to turn
right now

43:56.834 --> 44:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and ask you both about assessing
the convention
that we all have been watching
closely over

44:01.572 --> 44:03.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the week.

44:03.541 --> 44:07.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Donald Trump actually
stepped into a little
more controversy today. He had a
news conference.

44:07.378 --> 44:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about how he didn't
want Ted Cruz's
endorsement, even if Cruz
offered it. And

44:13.317 --> 44:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he went on to bring up, to
resurrect controversy
in the past when he suggested
that Cruz's

44:19.156 --> 44:24.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
father might have some
connection to the John
F. Kennedy assassination,
comments about the

44:24.328 --> 44:26.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looks of Ted Cruz's wife.

44:26.998 --> 44:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does this say to us about
Donald Trump?

44:29.700 --> 44:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he has
teleprompter moments,
but they always precede a
relapse.

44:35.473 --> 44:39.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's had another
Trump-being-Trump relapse.
And we should get used to that.
He's never

44:39.477 --> 44:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be someone who's normal
or is on
message or who is particularly
charitable

44:44.649 --> 44:46.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to anybody.

44:46.684 --> 44:51.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My two big takeaways 24 hours
later, first,
I'm beginning to think Cruz had
a good convention,

44:51.923 --> 44:57.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if Trump goes down, Cruz is
pretty well
positioned to be the Republican
major figure

44:57.361 --> 45:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in four, six or even within two
years.

45:00.665 --> 45:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second big thing, we talked
about it last
night, his decision to go law
and order. And

45:06.037 --> 45:10.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the moment, I thought it was
a mistake,
because I do think economic and
social anxiety

45:10.908 --> 45:15.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the number one issue. And I'm
pretty confident
Hillary Clinton will be really
riding that

45:15.746 --> 45:17.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
train pretty hard.

45:17.715 --> 45:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what happened in Munich
today, if there
is a series of attacks like that
or, God forbid,

45:23.054 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if ISIS is really sending
soldiers across
Europe and maybe across the
world for a barrage

45:27.592 --> 45:34.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of these things, then the
political climate
is revolutionized here. And
maybe the Trump

45:34.865 --> 45:39.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
speech will look like a
precursor to a climate
that we're all about to walk
into.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the Munich thing has to
adjust the way
we look back at that convention.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, what about
that?

45:44.709 --> 45:50.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does -- we talked about the law
and order
emphasis from Donald Trump's
remarks last

45:50.815 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night. Does he automatically
benefit from
incidents like this one today in
Munich?

45:55.553 --> 45:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. Yes, he does.

45:59.056 --> 46:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, the pattern of American
presidential
elections is that the more
optimistic candidate,

46:04.929 --> 46:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it's John Kennedy and
let's get America
moving again, Ronald Reagan,
it's morning

46:09.367 --> 46:16.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America, or Barack Obama,
yes, we can,
always wins, or nearly always
wins.

46:16.273 --> 46:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's been tapped into sort
of the DNA
of Americans, that optimism and
confidence.

46:22.580 --> 46:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are not nearly as optimistic
and far less
confident than we were as a
people. And Donald

46:28.519 --> 46:33.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is writing a different
theme, which
is it's midnight in America and
that things

46:33.290 --> 46:36.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are bad, and they're bleak, and
they're gloomy
and they're doomy, and the only
thing that

46:36.460 --> 46:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to save you is someone
with the authority
and power of somebody like me.

46:43.401 --> 46:52.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I personally believe that
he's wrong
on the condition of America.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: About the
condition...

46:54.645 --> 47:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We're not being
invaded by undocumented
immigrants who are coming to
kill police officers

47:00.518 --> 47:02.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and commit crimes.

47:02.620 --> 47:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that's true. And I
don't think
most Americans think it's true,
but it does

47:07.992 --> 47:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reinforce his argument, as the
law and order
candidate, when there are acts
of such reckless

47:14.165 --> 47:18.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and terrible, horrific
lawlessness as there
was today in Munich.

47:18.869 --> 47:23.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David, all in
all, this
was a good convention for Donald
Trump?

47:23.741 --> 47:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would say I
would give it
maybe a five out of 10. It was
shambolically

47:28.546 --> 47:30.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organized.

47:30.347 --> 47:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still think the speech was
relentlessly
negative and probably off-key,
but it did

47:34.552 --> 47:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hammer home some points. And the
one thing
I do think Hillary Clinton
really has to do

47:37.755 --> 47:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in her convention is to rebut
this frame that
Trump has set up, nationalism
vs. globalism.

47:43.561 --> 47:46.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She cannot appear as a
globalist, whatever
that means.

47:46.163 --> 47:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's beginning to do that by
talking about
American greatness, but that's
the task in

47:49.500 --> 47:50.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
front of her.

47:50.935 --> 47:52.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Mark? What
does she need to do?

47:52.903 --> 47:58.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think she has
got to be optimistic.
I think she has to be -- she has
to reveal

47:58.275 --> 47:59.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
herself. I mean...

47:59.744 --> 48:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?
She's been
around for a long time.

48:03.614 --> 48:07.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, there are
people who
know Hillary Clinton who tell
wonderful stories

48:08.085 --> 48:15.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about her, how likable she is,
how funny she
is; 99 percent of American
people don't -- have

48:15.292 --> 48:17.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never seen that side of her.

48:17.294 --> 48:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it's her guarded privacy
or whatever
else, I mean, there has got to
be some sense

48:22.199 --> 48:24.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this is a human being that
I can identify.

48:24.602 --> 48:31.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me argue with David, dissent
with him
on Ted Cruz. If Donald Trump
does lose, and

48:31.142 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially if he loses the way
that David
describes, being revealed as
this bizarre

48:36.413 --> 48:41.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personality, Ted Cruz is not
going to be what
Republicans are looking for in
2020.

48:41.652 --> 48:46.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Coats, retiring senator from
Indiana,
a mild-mannered man, a former
United States

48:46.991 --> 48:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambassador to Germany, former
congressman,
a respected member of the
Senate, said of

48:52.229 --> 48:57.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz after this week in
Cleveland he's
the most self-centered,
narcissistic, pathological

48:57.968 --> 49:02.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liar I have ever seen. And he
said, you can
quote me on that.

49:03.073 --> 49:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is the kind of feeling
that his
colleagues have. People are
going to be asking

49:08.245 --> 49:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody at 2020 after this kind
of election
that David and I both expect it
to be, what

49:13.517 --> 49:18.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of person is this? Is this
somebody we
can be comfortable, somebody we
can be confident

49:18.889 --> 49:21.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, somebody who is not neurotic
or worse?

49:21.525 --> 49:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're talking
about Ted Cruz
at this point.

49:23.894 --> 49:24.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:24.695 --> 49:25.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And Donald Trump.

49:25.729 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump
agrees with him.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.
Right.

49:28.532 --> 49:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
what about Mark's
point about Hillary Clinton
needs to show

49:32.670 --> 49:38.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more of who she really is,
something personal
about herself? What about that?

49:38.809 --> 49:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It is true there
is a contrast
between the candidates.

49:42.713 --> 49:45.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is absolutely true the people
who work
for Hillary Clinton speak of her
in glowing

49:45.816 --> 49:50.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms and say she's loyal, she's
thoughtful,
she thinks about them, she
remembers birthdays.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When something bad has happened,
she's there
for them.

49:52.723 --> 49:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are not stories you hear
about Donald
Trump. Nobody is saying, I wish
-- the Trump

49:56.260 --> 49:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know is so personal and warm.
Nobody says
that. Even if his own daughter,
when she talks

50:00.064 --> 50:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- Ivanka, when she talks about
her dad, it's
because she got to go see him on
a work site.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not because he is ever at
home.

50:05.436 --> 50:10.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, with Hillary, there is
apparently this
warm side that she has never let
us see, but

50:10.140 --> 50:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that intimates really do talk
about. But to
reveal that would mean breaking
through the

50:15.446 --> 50:20.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wall of distrust that she's
encased herself
in for the last 25 years.

50:20.551 --> 50:25.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not sure she's -- she's
never shown
a personal willingness to do
that, because

50:25.122 --> 50:30.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it makes her vulnerable. And her
emotional
invulnerability has at once made
her survive,

50:30.594 --> 50:34.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but has hurt her politically and
her likability
ratings. So, I really don't
expect her to

50:34.231 --> 50:36.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

50:36.100 --> 50:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just very quickly
to both of
you, there was such a vitriolic
-- no other

50:39.737 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
word for it -- hatred of Hillary
Clinton,
with the "Lock her up" and
"Hillary to Prison"

50:44.575 --> 50:46.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming out of the Republican
Convention.

50:46.343 --> 50:51.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
David, quickly, is there
something she can
do to undo that animus, or is it
just baked

50:51.382 --> 50:52.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in?

50:52.583 --> 50:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I don't think
she can do
anything.

50:54.518 --> 50:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be interesting to see
how much animus
there is against Donald Trump
and whether

50:57.221 --> 50:59.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we have the same sort of
emotional tone.

50:59.456 --> 51:03.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Democrats, if
they're smart
and they're not brain-dead, are
doing two

51:03.794 --> 51:05.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things right now.

51:05.729 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're having self-deprecating
humor written
for them. There was no humor in
Cleveland.

51:09.767 --> 51:13.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are not making this a
Donald Trump...

51:13.103 --> 51:13.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:14.004 --> 51:15.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bashing
convention.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

51:17.942 --> 51:19.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks,
get some rest this weekend. We
will see you

51:19.310 --> 51:35.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday at the convention in
Philadelphia.
Thank you both.

51:35.359 --> 51:40.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Updating this night's breaking
news: Munich,
Germany, is on lockdown after
one or more

51:40.497 --> 51:46.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gunmen killed eight people in
and near a shopping
mall. A ninth body may be that
of an attacker.

51:46.971 --> 51:52.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there's word that the
Virginia Supreme
Court has struck down a move to
restore voting

51:52.276 --> 51:54.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
rights to felons.

51:54.278 --> 51:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tune in later this evening. Gwen
Ifill has
another special "Washington
Week" on the road

51:59.016 --> 51:59.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

52:00.050 --> 52:01.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Hey, Judy. I miss
you already.

52:02.052 --> 52:07.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're here in downtown
Philadelphia, preparing
to look back at an eventful week
at the Republican

52:07.224 --> 52:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Convention in Cleveland and
ahead to the Democrats'
meeting not far from here
beginning on Monday.

52:13.464 --> 52:18.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once again, there will be
veepstakes and careful
positioning, as both parties
prepare to launch

52:18.936 --> 52:21.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the general election
campaign season.

52:21.238 --> 52:23.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will see you when you get
here, Judy.

52:23.374 --> 52:25.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I can't wait
either.

52:25.376 --> 52:29.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Gwen said, I will be
joining her and
