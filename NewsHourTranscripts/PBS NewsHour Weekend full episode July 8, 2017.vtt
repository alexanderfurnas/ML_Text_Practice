ON SOME REMOTE ISLAND WHERE IT'S

04:56.362 --> 04:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT FOR PROTESTERS TO DO

04:58.331 --> 04:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AND THIS IS GOING TO GO AHEAD.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

05:07.740 --> 05:08.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T CRACK DOWN AS MUCH

05:08.908 --> 05:10.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
