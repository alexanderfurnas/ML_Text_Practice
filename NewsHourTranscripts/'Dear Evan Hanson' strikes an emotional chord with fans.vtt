JUDY WOODRUFF: As the 2007 Tony
Awards approach this Sunday,
we look at one of this season's

00:07.066 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest Broadway hits and
the impact it's having.

00:09.766 --> 00:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with
the story from New York.

00:12.866 --> 00:17.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Dear
Evan Hansen" is a high
school musical, but one
in which the loneliness

00:23.433 --> 00:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pain of teen life is front
and center, and the sense
of isolation intensified in

00:29.300 --> 00:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today's social media world.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the famed Sardi's Restaurant
recently, star Ben Platt
said audiences are clearly

00:36.833 --> 00:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finding a connection.

00:38.900 --> 00:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT, Actor: People that
come to the show feel, right
now, especially with sort

00:42.000 --> 00:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of hyperconnectivity online
and with people feeling sort
of instantaneously judged all

00:45.566 --> 00:50.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the time, I think people
kind of recede into
these sort of bubbles.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The chance to sort of connect
and realize that nobody's
experience of loneliness is

00:57.966 --> 01:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unique and that everybody at
some time or another feels
sort of on the outside looking

01:01.800 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, or feels that they can't
really fully be present, or
that they aren't sort of one

01:06.333 --> 01:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the whole, but rather
on their own, is a really
powerful thing right now.

01:13.266 --> 01:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
23-year-old Platt grew up
around movies and theater.

01:19.533 --> 01:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His father, Marc, is a
major producer of hits,
including "Wicked."

01:23.833 --> 01:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before this production, Ben
was known for roles in the
"Pitch Perfect" films and in

01:33.633 --> 01:37.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the musical "The
Book of Mormon."

01:37.866 --> 01:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He plays Evan Hansen as
a young man so insecure,
he can barely speak.

01:42.233 --> 01:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an acclaimed performance
of teenage awkwardness
and vibrant singing.

01:49.166 --> 01:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT: This role is
certainly the biggest challenge
I have had so far in my life.

01:54.733 --> 01:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a huge blessing in that
way, too, because I feel like
I'm using all of the proverbial

01:57.833 --> 02:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tools that I have in my belt,
which is all you want as an
actor, is to feel like you're

02:00.666 --> 02:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really being able to show
everything you have got.

02:03.933 --> 02:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, vocally and physically
and emotionally and all of
that, it requires a lot.

02:07.266 --> 02:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When a classmate
commits suicide, Evan Hansen
is mistakenly seen as his one

02:12.733 --> 02:14.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
friend.

02:14.766 --> 02:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evan is suddenly a subject
of interest to his classmates
and the other boy's family.

02:20.433 --> 02:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gains a girlfriend and even
a kind of instant celebrity when
a speech he gives about suicide

02:24.200 --> 02:25.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes viral.

02:25.966 --> 02:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's all a misunderstanding,
destined to come crashing
down around him.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Steven Levenson wrote the story.

02:32.866 --> 02:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN LEVENSON, Author, "Dear
Evan Hansen": It's very much
this singular story of this

02:34.900 --> 02:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person in the world that we
know very well, but struggling
with these things that hopefully

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are things that we all
know and experience.

02:42.800 --> 02:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we never wanted it to feel
like learning or didactic.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We never wanted to teach
the audience a lesson or
to talk about technology.

02:52.733 --> 02:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We just wanted to tell
this story and hopefully
illuminate something
about the world in doing

02:56.433 --> 02:58.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

02:58.566 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GREIF, Director: Yes,
and like in all the -- in all
great theater writing, those

03:00.266 --> 03:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themes get expressed
through that story.

03:02.966 --> 03:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those things become
a part of Evan's story
and a part of his world.

03:07.900 --> 03:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Michael
Greif previously staged two
Pulitzer Prize-winning musicals,

03:12.600 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Rent" and "Next to
Normal," that took on
complex contemporary
issues, such as drug

03:18.466 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
addiction and bipolar disorder.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You clearly feel that musicals
can tell difficult stories.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GREIF: Yes, certainly.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I grew up seeing a lot of
different kinds of musicals.

03:28.666 --> 03:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the musicals I was always
particularly drawn to were --
"Man of La Mancha," I think

03:33.200 --> 03:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was the first
musical I ever saw.

03:35.533 --> 03:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Talk about a musical with
serious purpose and dark themes
that are expressed, you know,

03:42.600 --> 03:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musicals that really do say
something real and authentic
about "The Times" that they

03:46.900 --> 03:49.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were made in.

03:49.433 --> 03:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Dear Evan
Hansen" has certainly
struck a chord with
audiences, and many have

03:52.600 --> 03:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shared their gratitude
and their own stories via
e-mails and social media.

03:57.233 --> 04:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: "I brought our
15-year-old daughter and
13-year-old son to the show.

04:01.300 --> 04:06.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Their older sister, our
16-year-old daughter,
died by suicide a
little over a year ago.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are still devastated.

04:09.133 --> 04:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it helps us when people
talk about mental illness with
understanding and compassion,

04:12.133 --> 04:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as you did in your show."

04:13.733 --> 04:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: "The 'Dear
Evan Hansen' soundtrack
has saved my life."

04:17.166 --> 04:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: "Last night, I
found out my dear high school
friend had taken his own life

04:21.800 --> 04:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Thursday afternoon.

04:23.833 --> 04:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am devastated by this loss,
but grateful for having a
show like 'Dear Evan Hansen'

04:27.666 --> 04:29.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to turn to.

04:29.733 --> 04:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just wanted to thank you
for getting me through this
incredibly difficult time.

04:32.666 --> 04:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
#Youwillbefound."

04:34.133 --> 04:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ben Platt hears
such stories every night.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT: When I get to met
-- the opportunity to meet fans
after the show or hear from them

04:40.366 --> 04:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
online or via letters, they
feel really comfortable
divulging really personal
things and opening

04:46.233 --> 04:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up about their own struggles.

04:47.466 --> 04:49.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh,
really, to you?

04:49.533 --> 04:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT: Certainly, with
anxiety and with self-harm and
with inability to connect and

04:52.833 --> 04:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all sorts of things.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's an incredibly
beautiful thing, and I want
nothing more than for the show

04:56.933 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to encourage that and to be able
to receive things like that.

05:00.700 --> 05:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's no spoiler
alert to say that the show
does end on an upbeat note.

05:05.666 --> 05:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is about finding
your way through pain.

05:08.033 --> 05:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN LEVENSON: Just as a
writer, just philosophically,
I want to leave the
audience feeling some

05:14.833 --> 05:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of hope and some kind of --
I'm not interested in grim, and
I'm not interested in torture,

05:19.800 --> 05:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching things that just make
you feel awful, because we have
enough of that in the world.

05:23.333 --> 05:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Evan, I think, ultimately
in the story, what was so
exciting was finding that the

05:27.533 --> 05:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story really wasn't about
a suicide, but more about a
character saving his own life.

05:34.466 --> 05:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As for the actor
playing that character, as
Broadway's hottest young star,

05:39.766 --> 05:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his life will never be the same.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, is all this pretty
heady stuff, all this?

05:44.333 --> 05:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BEN PLATT: It's
incredibly heady.

05:46.433 --> 05:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been my dream since I was
a really little kid to just be
in the Broadway community at

05:52.100 --> 05:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all, and to do musical
theater as a job.

05:54.666 --> 05:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now for that to be
true and to be doing it
in a show that's making
this big of a mark,

05:58.333 --> 06:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and in a role that comes
around not ever, is,
like, very hard to fathom.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's wonderful
beyond my wildest dreams.

06:06.700 --> 06:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ben Platt, Steven
Levenson, and Michael Greif
all received Tony nominations,

06:13.333 --> 06:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among the nine garnered by
"Dear Evan Hansen," including
one for best musical.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown on Broadway.

06:20.500 --> 06:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's
gratifying to know that
show is having an effect
around the country.
