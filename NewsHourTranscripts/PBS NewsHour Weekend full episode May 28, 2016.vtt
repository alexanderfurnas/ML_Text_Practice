AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE THINKS

16:22.815 --> 16:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE DOING A HUGE DISSERVICE TO

16:25.184 --> 16:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTORNEYS BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO

16:26.319 --> 16:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME OUT INTO THE BOONIES.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WE'RE SENTENCING THEM

16:29.922 --> 16:32.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO A LIFE OF POVERTY AS A RESULT

OF THIS.

THAT?

16:37.496 --> 16:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT

16:38.331 --> 16:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS LUCRATIVE AS IT WOULD BE IF

16:39.632 --> 16:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO MAKE THESE YOUNG ATTORNEYS

16:52.111 --> 16:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I ENJOYED THE VARIETY.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SMALL TOWN ATTORNEYS, AND ASK

17:08.194 --> 17:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM, "HEY, WHY ARE YOU HERE?"

17:09.562 --> 17:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL TELL YOU TWO THINGS.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS THE LIFESTYLE; THEY

17:12.331 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO

LOCK THEIR DOORS AT NIGHT.

17:15.301 --> 17:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SECONDLY, IT'S THE

OPPORTUNITY TO SEE CLIENTS, FACE

THE NEURODEGENERATION YOU SEE

19:19.658 --> 19:21.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH IT, IS THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED

19:21.527 --> 19:23.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY A LITTLE PROTEIN THAT FORMS

19:23.562 --> 19:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CONCRETE-LIKE SUBSTANCE IN

AMYLOID, IT TURNS OUT, IS

19:28.334 --> 19:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY AN ANTI-MICROBIAL

19:30.436 --> 19:31.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEPTIDE.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS TO SAY, IT IS A

19:32.772 --> 19:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC THAT DEFENDS

19:34.673 --> 19:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST INFECTION IN THE BRAIN,

19:36.575 --> 19:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF YOU GET A VIRUS OR A

19:39.345 --> 19:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACTERIA THAT GETS INTO THE

19:41.547 --> 19:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRAIN, IT RISES TO DO BATTLE

19:43.682 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH IT, AND BINDS TO IT AND

19:46.485 --> 19:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN ENTRAPS IT IN THESE LONG

19:48.187 --> 19:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIBERS AND EVENTUALLY ENTOMBS IT

19:50.589 --> 19:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREVER.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS THEY MOUNT IN NUMBER,

19:53.225 --> 19:54.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTUALLY THEY START TO BE

19:54.460 --> 19:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOXIC TO OUR OWN CELLS, AND

19:56.996 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT LEADS TO THE

19:58.230 --> 19:59.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEURODEGENERATION.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT IS WHAT IT DOES.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

20:03.903 --> 20:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, OUR WORK DOES NOT SAY THIS

20:07.039 --> 20:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTLY BUT WHAT IT CERTAINLY

20:09.175 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS VERY PROVOCATIVE, IN TERMS OF

20:12.144 --> 20:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUGGESTING, IS THAT THERE IS AN

20:15.681 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFECTION IN A.D., MAYBE LOW

20:17.817 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEVEL, MAYBE MANY DIFFERENT

20:20.086 --> 20:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATHOGENS INCREASE INTO THE

20:21.821 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRAIN AND IT HAS TO FORM THIS

20:24.723 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMYLOID AROUND THEM AND THIS IS

20:26.725 --> 20:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DRIVES THE DISEASE.

20:28.694 --> 20:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: WHAT DO YOU

20:29.695 --> 20:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, THOUGH, THAT THIS COULD

20:30.830 --> 20:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLD PROMISE FOR?

20:31.831 --> 20:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT MORE PROMISING FOR FINDING

20:32.865 --> 20:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE

ALZHEIMER'S?

20:36.502 --> 20:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR IS IT MORE PROMISING FOR

20:37.703 --> 20:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE TO IDENTIFY WHO MIGHT BE

20:39.872 --> 20:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT RISK, OR BOTH?

20:41.607 --> 20:43.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT IS ACTUALLY BOTH.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE AN

20:45.010 --> 20:45.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFECTION, THERE IS A

20:45.945 --> 20:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY OF TREATING PEOPLE

20:48.814 --> 20:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE THEY GET A.D. WITH

VACCINES, TO TARGET THOSE

20:52.451 --> 20:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OF US WHO HAVE, NATURALLY, MORE

21:00.960 --> 21:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IN, THAN OTHERS?

21:04.663 --> 21:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD THAT HELP EXPLAIN WHY SOME

21:06.432 --> 21:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT BE MORE PRONE TO

21:07.233 --> 21:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALZHEIMER'S THAN OTHERS?

21:08.234 --> 21:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW THAT THERE IS OFTEN TALK

21:09.235 --> 21:10.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A GENETIC LINK AS WELL, TO

21:15.975 --> 21:17.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENETICS PLAYS A BIG PART, SO

21:17.910 --> 21:19.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:19.545 --> 21:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ALL HAVE AN AMYLOID IN OUR

21:25.050 --> 21:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONCE YOU TURN 40, YOU START TO

FASTER.

21:29.922 --> 21:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COULD BE DRIVEN BY THE

21:30.923 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENETICS-- THEY HAVE A HAIR-

21:33.392 --> 21:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIGGER WHEN IT COMES TO

21:34.827 --> 21:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMUNITY, OR IT COULD BE DRIVEN

21:36.862 --> 21:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE

21:38.030 --> 21:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING MORE PATHOGENS SNEAKING

21:40.266 --> 21:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THEIR BRAIN AND THERE COULD

21:42.635 --> 21:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT.

21:44.670 --> 21:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: WELL, WE

21:45.271 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
