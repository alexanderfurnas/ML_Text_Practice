JUDY WOODRUFF: Professional
baseball has reached
the midpoint of its
season, and it's turning

00:04.700 --> 00:07.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
out to be a most
compelling year.

00:07.300 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of the game's best players
are in Miami for the next couple
of nights for the midsummer

00:11.866 --> 00:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
classic, the All-Star Game.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Things kick off tonight
with the Home Run Derby.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown takes
it from there.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
at bat, another home run.

00:21.766 --> 00:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Balls are flying out of the
park this year at a record pace.

00:24.700 --> 00:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And adding to the excitement,
two of the biggest sluggers are
rookies Aaron Judge of the New

00:31.100 --> 00:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York Yankees and Cody Bellinger
of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

00:34.533 --> 00:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Verducci is an MLB Network
analyst, a senior writer for
"Sports Illustrated," and,

00:38.966 --> 00:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tomorrow, he will be the
FOX MLB reporter for the
All-Star Game in Miami.

00:43.866 --> 00:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He joins us from Marlins
Park, the site of the
all-star festivities.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tom, welcome to you.

00:49.833 --> 00:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first of all, all those
home runs, I have seen different
theories, the changes to the

00:55.166 --> 00:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
balls, changes to the swing.

00:56.666 --> 00:58.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's going on?

00:58.700 --> 00:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM VERDUCCI, "Sports
Illustrated": Well, a
little bit of everything.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like baking a cake.

01:00.766 --> 01:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just one ingredient.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are many ingredients.

01:04.366 --> 01:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you talk to the pitchers,
they will definitely talk about
the difference in the baseball,

01:08.200 --> 01:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the baseball actually is
wound tighter and the seams
on the baseball are smaller.

01:14.566 --> 01:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So if you have lower
seams, you have less drag.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have less drag, of
course, that means more carry,
and more fly balls are carrying

01:22.933 --> 01:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of ballparks.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you did bring up something.

01:25.833 --> 01:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hitters now know that to
make money in the baseball,
you have to do damage.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have to hit the
ball in the air.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this generation hitters
is all about launching
the ball in the air and
not necessarily hitting

01:40.700 --> 01:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it on the ground
for batting average.

01:42.066 --> 01:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It more about in
the air or slugging.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, speaking of
this generation, we have these
two new rookie stars, and they

01:46.766 --> 01:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
happen to be in very
large markets, right,
New York and L.A.

01:49.866 --> 01:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what kind of impact
are they having this year?

01:52.433 --> 01:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VERDUCCI: Yes, it's
the perfect storm for
baseball, because it
truly is the intersection

01:56.500 --> 02:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the two dominant
trends in baseball, number
one, the home runs we
talked about, and, number

02:01.166 --> 02:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two, the influx of
young stars in the game.

02:04.233 --> 02:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, baseball, traditionally,
there has been a
long learning curve.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even when they get to
the Major Leagues, after
their apprenticeship
in the minor leagues,

02:11.500 --> 02:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it takes a while for a
player to establish himself.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we're seeing now in
recent years -- and Judge and
Bellinger are great examples of

02:19.700 --> 02:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this -- hitters becoming impact
players almost immediately as
soon as they get to the big

02:25.166 --> 02:26.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leagues.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, I think this has
something to do with
our society in general.

02:28.266 --> 02:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're now specializing
at early ages.

02:31.333 --> 02:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, these hitters now
are specializing on the
art of hitting, rather
than playing multiple

02:37.700 --> 02:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sports, locking in on
their specific skills.

02:40.766 --> 02:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Judge and Bellinger
have hit the ground running.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And one more thing.

02:46.666 --> 02:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bellinger, in A Ball a couple
of years ago, specifically
changed his swing to hit more

02:52.100 --> 02:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
balls in the air.

02:54.066 --> 02:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, he's
adapted to this revolution
of fly ball hitters.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's paying off for him.

02:59.666 --> 03:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We have
this sort of overperforming
team in the Houston Astros
and the underperforming,

03:04.766 --> 03:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the reigning
champions, the Cubs.

03:06.966 --> 03:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But do want to ask you in
our last minute about this
continuing problem, the length

03:11.466 --> 03:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the games, something I notice
and probably a lot of the fans.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is it so hard
to change that?

03:16.966 --> 03:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM VERDUCCI: Sure.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, first of all, it's not
so much about length of game
as it is about the pace of

03:21.600 --> 03:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the action, how quickly
or not, as it is, is
the ball put in play.

03:26.566 --> 03:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's all the time
between pitches.

03:28.566 --> 03:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it is a
priority for Major League
Baseball going forward.

03:32.533 --> 03:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The game is strong right
now economically, but
I think baseball is
worried about a younger

03:36.566 --> 03:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generation of fans who get
turned off by the amount
of downtime in the game.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In soccer, football, basketball,
the ball is generally
in motion quite often.

03:46.533 --> 03:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In baseball, it's going
in the opposite direction.

03:49.300 --> 03:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, baseball now is talking
about some remedies,
talking about, now,
including perhaps a pitch

03:56.300 --> 04:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clock, where a pitcher now would
be literally under a clock to
deliver his next pitch, say,

04:00.866 --> 04:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within 20 seconds.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have tried that
in the minor leagues.

04:04.166 --> 04:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It definitely has worked
in transportation of moving
the game at a better place.

04:07.100 --> 04:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now baseball needs the
Players Association to agree
to that kind of change.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As they say,
negotiations are ongoing.

04:14.333 --> 04:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Tom Verducci, enjoy tomorrow
night's game, and thanks so much

04:18.633 --> 04:19.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for joining us.

04:19.633 --> 04:19.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM VERDUCCI: Thank you.
