JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.609 --> 00:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
General H.R. McMaster will
become the national

00:13.447 --> 00:15.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security adviser.

00:15.449 --> 00:19.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
announces his
new national security adviser
after the controversial

00:19.653 --> 00:21.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ousting of Michael Flynn.

00:21.955 --> 00:27.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: the search to find closure
for families
who have lost loved ones on the
dangerous

00:27.494 --> 00:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journey across the U.S. southern
border.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELY ORTIZ, Founder, Aguilas Del
Desierto (through
translator): Where's my brother?

00:32.499 --> 00:33.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happened to him?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How did he die?

00:35.469 --> 00:39.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our Politics
Monday team
takes stock of the first month
of the Trump

00:39.673 --> 00:41.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

00:41.074 --> 00:48.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:48.115 --> 00:50.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.918 --> 00:59.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president has
a new national
security adviser tonight.

00:59.993 --> 01:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He named Army Lieutenant General
H.R. McMaster
today, a week after retired
General Michael

01:05.933 --> 01:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flynn was forced out and after
the first choice
for a replacement turned it
down.

01:12.039 --> 01:16.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Retired Army Lieutenant General
Keith Kellogg
will serve as the Security
Council's chief

01:16.276 --> 01:17.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of staff.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump made the announcement
at his Mar-a-Lago
resort in Florida.

01:21.014 --> 01:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
He's a man of tremendous talent
and tremendous

01:24.651 --> 01:25.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

01:25.652 --> 01:29.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I watched and read a lot over
last two days.

01:29.790 --> 01:35.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is highly respected by
everybody in the
military and we're very honored
to have him.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
H.R. MCMASTER, U.S. National
Security Adviser:
I would just like to say what a
privilege

01:38.131 --> 01:40.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is to be able to continue
serving our nation.

01:40.667 --> 01:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm grateful to you for that
opportunity,
and I look forward to joining
the national

01:44.538 --> 01:49.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
security team and doing
everything I can to
advance and protect the interest
of the American

01:49.309 --> 01:50.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You're going to do
a great job.

01:53.046 --> 01:57.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For some
background on H.R.
McMaster: He's 54 years old and
currently

01:57.117 --> 01:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a three-star general in the U.S.
Army.

01:59.920 --> 02:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He graduated from West Point in
1984, and
later earned a Ph.D. in military
history.

02:06.193 --> 02:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His doctoral thesis, about the
failures of
military and political
leadership during the

02:11.298 --> 02:17.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vietnam War, later became a
well-regarded
book titled "Dereliction of
Duty."

02:17.270 --> 02:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the first Gulf War with
Iraq in 1991,
he lead a tank unit that
prevailed against

02:23.276 --> 02:25.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraq's powerful Republican
Guard.

02:25.979 --> 02:32.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also lead American forces in
Iraq in 2005,
and successfully brought
stability to a city

02:32.552 --> 02:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that had been rife with ethnic
conflict.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all of this, we turn
to Washington
Post reporter Greg Jaffe.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has known McMaster for years.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg Jaffe, welcome back to the
program.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were just telling me you
have known him,
what, for 14 years?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG JAFFE, The Washington Post:
Yes, I think
2002.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: 2002.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What should we know about him?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: He's fiercely
opinionated.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's very, very smart.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's passionate.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's funny.

02:56.910 --> 03:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He understands the media, I
think, and talks
to reporters, interestingly.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think he views them as
the enemy.

03:04.351 --> 03:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I think the one
knock against
him is, when he believes he's
right, he passionately

03:09.689 --> 03:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
argues that point and he doesn't
stop.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, after a while, that
can be too
much for folks.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell me about his
military
career.

03:17.330 --> 03:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were just reporting he had a
very successful
career during the first Iraq --
the Gulf War.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What made him so successful?

03:26.273 --> 03:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: Well, during the
first Gulf War,
he was involved in the Battle of
73 Easting

03:31.011 --> 03:31.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he was a tank company
commander.

03:34.081 --> 03:40.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his tank company prevailed
against a much
larger unit of the Iraqi
Republican Guard.

03:40.587 --> 03:43.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His real fame, though, came
later in Iraq
in 2006.

03:43.490 --> 03:46.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what made him
so successful?

03:46.493 --> 03:50.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: You know, he was his
group, I
think "The New Yorker" described
them as -- his

03:50.497 --> 03:55.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unit in Iraq as rebels against
an incoherent
strategy was a great line from
"The New Yorker."

03:55.669 --> 03:59.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at that time, the strategy
in the U.S.
was, we will stand -- the U.S.
strategy in

03:59.473 --> 04:02.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraq was, we will stand down as
the Iraqis
stand up.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was training the Iraqi
forces.

04:04.978 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went against that and said,
look, we can't
train the Iraqi forms until we
stabilize the

04:09.216 --> 04:10.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

04:10.984 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he pushed his troops into the
city of Tal
Afar, established 29 outposts in
the city,

04:15.455 --> 04:18.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and really stopped the killing
and the violence,
and then focused on rebuilding.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it became a strategy known
as clear, hold
and build.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clear, hold and
build.

04:23.296 --> 04:27.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How is he viewed, Greg Jaffe, by
the rest
of the Army, by the military?

04:27.167 --> 04:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: I think, in many
cases, with great
admiration, because he's so
frank, he's so

04:32.839 --> 04:33.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
smart.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's interesting, though.

04:35.742 --> 04:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he was promoted from
colonel to one-star,
he was passed for promotion to
one-star general

04:40.514 --> 04:41.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
twice.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think in some cases, that
was a reflection
on how frank he can be.

04:45.519 --> 04:49.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He doesn't hold back his
opinions and sometimes
that rubs folks the wrong way.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a
political philosophy
there, or are you talking about
a philosophy

04:53.460 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of war, of fighting?

04:55.295 --> 04:58.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: A philosophy of war
and fighting.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not a political guy in any
way, shape
or form.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that is interesting,
too.

05:03.503 --> 05:08.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think he will bring --
he won't bring
very sharp political instincts
on the downside.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the upside, he's not a
political ideologue.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has very strong opinions
about war, though.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were telling
me -- we were
talking about how he's a -- you
said he's

05:16.216 --> 05:17.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a prolific writer.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's written a lot for -- we
were looking
at the Web site for the Hoover
Institution,

05:22.722 --> 05:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a conservative think tank.

05:24.925 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of it is about military
strategy, and
leadership, he writes about.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: And for The New York
Times.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just reading an op-ed he
wrote for The
New York Times which begins by
quoting Saul

05:35.001 --> 05:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bellow, which is not something
you normally
hear from a U.S. Army officer.

05:38.572 --> 05:43.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do but think --
based on what
know about him -- you were
saying, Greg Jaffe,

05:43.443 --> 05:45.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he hasn't spent a lot of
time in Washington.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you see him fitting into
this city?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's going smack to the
middle of power
at the White House?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: Yes, I think that
will be interesting.

05:52.752 --> 05:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has dealt a lot in Tal Afar
and then in
Iraq he ran -- or -- I'm sorry
-- in Afghanistan,

05:57.958 --> 06:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he ran an anti-corruption task
force for General
Petraeus in 2010.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that meant he had to deal
with a lot
of arms of government.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had to deal with the State
Department.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He had to deal with the
intelligence agencies,
all those things that you have
to deal with

06:10.070 --> 06:11.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a national security adviser.

06:11.838 --> 06:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hasn't spent a lot of time
thinking and
worrying about politics in
Washington.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's going to be a
challenge
and a stretch for him, because
the national

06:19.346 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security adviser job isn't
fundamentally a
political job, but he certainly
has to take

06:23.883 --> 06:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.C. politics into account.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
he's going to
have a military man as his chief
of staff,

06:28.521 --> 06:30.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keith Kellogg.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to be dealing, of
course, with
a retired general at the
Pentagon.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing a lot of military
people in this
administration.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: Yes, that's right.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it will be interesting.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's an interesting dynamic,
isn't it?

06:41.735 --> 06:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's not a
position that
requires confirmation by the
Senate.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is the president's
choice.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it sounds like he's somebody
very different
from Michael Flynn.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG JAFFE: Yes, I think he is.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is widely -- and I think
Flynn was widely
respected in the Army, but I
think he's seen

06:57.917 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a much more sort of steadying
figure than
Flynn would be, much less of an
erratic figure.

07:02.656 --> 07:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Jaffe with
The Washington
Post, thank you so much.

07:05.825 --> 07:06.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG JAFFE: Sure.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for having me.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news:
Thousands of anti-Trump
protesters turned

07:12.465 --> 07:14.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out in cities across the
country.

07:14.701 --> 07:17.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They called it Not My
President's Day.

07:17.504 --> 07:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Demonstrators marched, chanted
and carried
signs in New York, Chicago,
Washington and

07:22.942 --> 07:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Los Angeles, among other places.

07:24.844 --> 07:30.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They challenged Trump policies
on everything
from immigration to abortion.

07:30.250 --> 07:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British lawmakers debated today
whether to
rescind an invitation to
President Trump for

07:34.754 --> 07:36.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a state visit.

07:36.423 --> 07:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An online petition against it
has gathered
more than 1.8 million
signatures.

07:41.661 --> 07:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands protested against the
president
outside Parliament today, as
lawmakers held

07:46.232 --> 07:48.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a nonbinding debate.

07:48.168 --> 07:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LAMMY, British Parliament:
I can't imagine
a leader of our own country, of
whatever political

07:53.440 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stripe, behaving in that manner.

07:55.275 --> 08:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is for that reason that I
think people
are offended and concerned that
Britain should

08:03.883 --> 08:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
abandon all its principles.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIGEL EVANS, British Parliament:
I certainly
don't like some of the things
that he has

08:07.954 --> 08:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said in the past, but I do
respect the fact
that he stood on a platform on
which he is

08:12.959 --> 08:14.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now delivering.

08:14.761 --> 08:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is going to go down in
history as being
roundly condemned for being the
only politician

08:19.099 --> 08:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to deliver on his promises.

08:20.900 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Since the 1950s,
only two other
American presidents have
received the full

08:25.772 --> 08:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pomp and pageantry of a state
visit to Britain,
George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

08:32.445 --> 08:37.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russian ambassador to the
United Nations,
Vitaly Churkin, died suddenly
today.

08:37.717 --> 08:42.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian officials said he fell
ill at his
office in New York, and passed
away later

08:42.088 --> 08:43.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a hospital.

08:43.957 --> 08:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was a well-known figure in
Russian diplomatic
circles, and had been U.N.
ambassador since

08:48.495 --> 08:49.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2006.

08:49.662 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vitaly Churkin would have turned
65 years
old tomorrow.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iraq, government forces
advanced into the
southwestern outskirts of Mosul.

08:58.505 --> 09:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the second day of a new
offensive to
drive Islamic State fighters
from the city's

09:03.743 --> 09:05.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
western half.

09:05.445 --> 09:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police and army troops engaged
in gun battles
as they closed on the city's
airport.

09:10.617 --> 09:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were backed by Iraqi
helicopters that
rocketed a village on a key
hill.

09:16.222 --> 09:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, officials
in Northern
California kept a close eye on
swollen creeks

09:21.361 --> 09:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and rivers as the latest in a
series of huge
rainstorms rolled over the
region.

09:26.766 --> 09:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
San Francisco reported record
rain totals,
surpassing the normal amount for
its entire

09:32.672 --> 09:34.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wet season.

09:34.607 --> 09:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To the south, in Santa Cruz
County, they counted
nearly three inches of rain in
24 hours, and

09:40.113 --> 09:42.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could get eight more.

09:42.949 --> 09:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And political circles are abuzz
after Milo
Yiannopoulos was disinvited to
address the

09:48.888 --> 09:51.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Conservative Political Action
Conference.

09:51.424 --> 09:56.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The planned speech by the highly
polarizing
Breitbart news editor had
already triggered

09:56.863 --> 09:59.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a social media backlash.

09:59.199 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then video clips resurfaced in
which Yiannopoulos
joked about pedophilia.

10:04.337 --> 10:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called it -- quote -- "sloppy
phrasing,"
but CPAC organizers said that's
not enough.

10:11.511 --> 10:17.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And still to come on the
"NewsHour": mixed
messages about American support
for NATO;

10:17.150 --> 10:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
searching for migrants who don't
survive the
treacherous journey to the U.S.
border; our

10:22.822 --> 10:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politics Monday team on the
latest political
news; and much more.

10:37.270 --> 10:42.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Top members of the Trump
administration have
been traveling overseas to calm
some raw nerves

10:42.575 --> 10:44.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
among U.S. allies.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The main source of the concern?

10:46.312 --> 10:51.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Comments from President Trump
that led to
worries in Europe and beyond
about American

10:51.217 --> 10:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commitments to longstanding
alliances and
institutions.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has more.

10:57.457 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Vice President Pence
spent his
holiday weekend hard at work,
trying to reassure

11:02.996 --> 11:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nervous leaders in Europe that
the United
States has their back.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
Whatever our differences, our
two continents

11:09.802 --> 11:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
share the same heritage, the
same values and,
above all, the same purpose, to
promote peace

11:15.575 --> 11:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and prosperity through freedom,
democracy
and the rule of law.

11:19.879 --> 11:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Brussels, the vice
president
underscored American support for
NATO and

11:24.284 --> 11:26.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the European Union.

11:26.386 --> 11:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has called NATO
obsolete,
and praised Britain's decision
to abandon

11:30.356 --> 11:32.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the E.U.

11:32.425 --> 11:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a campaign-style rally in
Florida this
weekend, Mr. Trump seemed to
soften his tone

11:38.998 --> 11:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bit, even as he called again
for greater
burden-sharing among the allies.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I'm a NATO fan.

11:45.505 --> 11:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of the countries in
NATO, many of
the countries that we protect,
many of these

11:52.211 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries are very rich
countries.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not paying their bills.

11:57.951 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, European
Council President
Donald Tusk welcomed the vice
president's

12:03.089 --> 12:06.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reassurance, but appealed for
unequivocal
American support.

12:06.159 --> 12:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: Too
many new, and sometimes
surprising, opinions

12:10.163 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been voiced over this time
about our
relations and our common
security for us to

12:17.737 --> 12:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pretend that everything is as it
used to be.

12:20.840 --> 12:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Separately, the head
of NATO said
he doesn't believe America first
means America

12:26.245 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alone.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Senator John McCain
issued his
own critique at the Munich
security conference.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without naming the president, he
wondered
aloud what earlier leaders would
have said.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:37.857 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: They
would be alarmed
by the growing inability, and
even unwillingness,

12:41.527 --> 12:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to separate truth from lies.

12:43.563 --> 12:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, Defense
Secretary James
Mattis made a stop in Iraq
today.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump set off alarm
bells there
last month

12:51.604 --> 12:54.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If we kept the
oil, you probably
wouldn't have ISIS, because
that's where they

12:54.507 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made their money in the first
place, so we
should have kept the oil.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, OK, maybe we will have
another chance.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Mattis walked
it all back.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: All
of us in America have generally
paid for our

13:06.753 --> 13:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gas and oil all along, and I'm
sure that we
will continue to do so in the
future.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not in Iraq to seize
anybody's oil.

13:16.062 --> 13:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mattis also promised
continued
U.S. support for Iraq's
offensive to retake

13:21.067 --> 13:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mosul from the Islamic State.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn now to Steven Erlanger,
the London
bureau chief for The New York
Times.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Steve, thanks for joining us.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should warn folks, I think we
have got a
little bit of a satellite delay
here.

13:32.345 --> 13:38.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Steve, how reassuring were
these visits
from the vice president, the
secretary of

13:38.685 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defense, the secretary of state
to the European
leaders?

13:40.486 --> 13:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER, The New York
Times: Well,
they were reassuring up to a
point, but not

13:46.192 --> 13:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that reassuring, because, after
all, the president
of the United States has very
different views.

13:51.964 --> 13:56.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the president of the
United States
says words, words matter.

13:56.436 --> 14:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have this strange image
of his major
security officials and Cabinet
officials running

14:04.210 --> 14:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around telling everybody,
actually, don't
listen to the president of the
United States.

14:09.849 --> 14:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then two seconds later, the
president
tweets something or had that
strange, rambling

14:15.288 --> 14:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
press conference, and everybody
gets nervous
once again, because everything
seemed to be

14:21.394 --> 14:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- you could turn everything
upside down in
a minute.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So this is really the problem.

14:26.599 --> 14:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Trump has surrounded
himself with
a lot of basically sensible,
traditional security

14:33.806 --> 14:34.774 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
figures.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's just done it again with
McMaster.

14:36.642 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A lot of them are either
businessmen, who
don't really know diplomacy, or
they're generals,

14:42.682 --> 14:49.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have a very strict notion of
diplomacy,
which usually starts with a gun.

14:49.522 --> 14:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're dealing with a whole
network of
European officials who are used
to American

14:56.496 --> 15:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership beginning from the
top and American
support for the idea of a Europe
which is

15:04.003 --> 15:09.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
free, which has shared
sovereignty, which
is in America's interests.

15:09.876 --> 15:16.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Trump seems to talk, as
far as they're
concerned, about every alliance
being transactional,

15:16.682 --> 15:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's a debt to pay or a
bill.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATO isn't about bills.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America's part of NATO because
it's in America's
interests.

15:25.258 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And America does pay quite a
lot, but it has
Asian interests, it has lots of
other defense

15:30.196 --> 15:31.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interests.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, the Europeans are
paying more.

15:33.332 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The price is less of an issue
than the efficiency
of the spending and the way it's
actually

15:39.972 --> 15:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used, particularly in the face
of new threats
from Russia.

15:43.776 --> 15:48.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump's bromance with
Vladimir Putin shakes
people a great deal, though they
don't like

15:49.015 --> 15:49.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to talk about it.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't really understand it.

15:51.918 --> 16:00.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But in the face of more
aggressive Russia,
of cyber-warfare, of fake news,
of the misuse

16:00.560 --> 16:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of social media -- or the use of
social media
to undermine allied leaders like
Angela Merkel

16:08.000 --> 16:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the British government or the
European
Union itself, these are really
troubling things

16:13.239 --> 16:14.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for people.

16:14.974 --> 16:20.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's great for Vice
President Pence to
come and Jim Mattis to come and
basically

16:20.179 --> 16:26.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue the kinds of platitudes
that most American
leaders and administrations have
rarely had

16:26.986 --> 16:28.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

16:28.788 --> 16:34.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even those platitudes were
greeted with
some relief by people, though
they do wait

16:34.427 --> 16:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the next Trump statement
about some terrorist
attack in Sweden that actually
never happened

16:41.667 --> 16:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or how NATO is somehow about
paying bills
and not about mutual defense.

16:47.740 --> 16:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Steve, as you look
across the European
capitals, is there one country
or one nation

16:53.112 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or what nations are more
concerned than
others about what's going on now
with the

17:00.019 --> 17:01.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump administration?

17:01.888 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Well, I would
say right now
it's Germany, because Germany is
in the middle

17:05.925 --> 17:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of an election campaign that
will climax in
September.

17:11.330 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Angela Merkel is running for
a fourth
term.

17:15.568 --> 17:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she has been weakened by the
migrant crisis
and simple fatigue.

17:22.975 --> 17:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet she is the person who is
most seen
as the strongest figure in
Europe, not just

17:30.383 --> 17:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of the power of Germany
and the economy
of Germany, but in standing up
to Moscow and

17:37.023 --> 17:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Putin over Ukraine and Crimea.

17:40.526 --> 17:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's been crucial in keeping
the sanctions
against Russia over its
annexation of Crimea

17:46.933 --> 17:49.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and current activities.

17:49.201 --> 17:54.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a sense in Germany
that Trump,
for whatever reason, doesn't
care for her.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's very much a lover of
Brexit.

17:57.910 --> 18:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a suspicion that somehow
his real
sympathies are with the
alternative right,

18:05.251 --> 18:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not with the people who are
keeping Europe
strong.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Steve Erlanger with
The New York
Times, we have to leave it
there.

18:12.525 --> 18:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Steve, great to see you again.

18:16.829 --> 18:22.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN ERLANGER: Thanks.

18:22.234 --> 18:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Perhaps the
biggest campaign
promise President Trump has
called for action

18:29.608 --> 18:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on is building a wall along the
U.S.-Mexico
border.

18:33.980 --> 18:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jean Guerrero of KPBS and the
Fronteras desk
-- it's a public media
partnership -- discovers

18:39.752 --> 18:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crossing the border is already a
dangerous
journey, as she joins a group of
immigrants

18:45.024 --> 18:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patrolling vast swathes of
desert from California
to Arizona.

18:49.328 --> 18:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Marco Antonio
Garcia vanished
while crossing the border weeks
ago.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maximo Garcia shows me a text
message from
a drug mule with a crucial clue
about his

18:59.005 --> 19:00.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
missing grand-nephew.

19:00.773 --> 19:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: "Look for him in the coyote
arroyo near
the border, where there's some
fencing."

19:09.215 --> 19:14.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: A drug mule using
Garcia's
phone said he'd found the young
man's body

19:14.820 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and phone in the Arizona desert.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These men have volunteered to
search for him.

19:19.792 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are now starting our search
for Marco Antonio.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We drive into the desert, on our
way to hike
along one of the most dangerous
smuggling

19:28.868 --> 19:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
routes near the U.S.-Mexico
border.

19:31.070 --> 19:36.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): If we
find him,
it's bad news for me.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we don't find him, it's bad
news either
way.

19:39.045 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: The volunteers
prepare their
gear for hours of walking in
100-degree heat.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They stock up on water and ice.

19:48.287 --> 19:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They call themselves Aguilas del
Desierto,
or Eagles of the Desert.

19:56.328 --> 20:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're plumbers, farmers,
construction workers.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most are immigrants who live in
San Diego.

20:03.969 --> 20:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They spend their weekends
rescuing migrants
or recovering their bodies as
far away as

20:09.375 --> 20:11.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arizona.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELY ORTIZ, Founder, Aguilas del
Desierto (through
translator): So, their relatives
will stop

20:13.112 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having uncertainty about, what
happened to
my relative to give them that
peace.

20:20.753 --> 20:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Founder Ely Ortiz
started the
group after his own brother,
Rigoberto, disappeared

20:27.860 --> 20:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to enter the U.S. through
here in 2009.

20:31.163 --> 20:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His coyote, or human smuggler,
confessed he'd
abandoned Rigoberto during his
last breaths.

20:36.335 --> 20:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELY ORTIZ (through translator):
I would think,
where's my brother?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happened to him?

20:42.608 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How did he die?

20:44.276 --> 20:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A thousand thoughts went through
my head.

20:48.314 --> 20:52.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I told myself, I'm not going
to leave
my brother lying out there.

20:52.318 --> 20:56.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Ortiz called the
Mexican consulates,
Border Patrol and other
agencies.

20:56.288 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELY ORTIZ (through translator):
I asked everyone
for help, and nobody would help
me.

21:00.392 --> 21:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: So he went out on
foot, with
the help of human rights
activist named Rafael

21:05.097 --> 21:06.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hernandez.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Together, they found his
brother's body.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was closure for the Ortiz
family.

21:10.903 --> 21:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Inspired, Ortiz launched Aguilas
del Desierto.

21:15.741 --> 21:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He chose the name Aguilas
because of the eagle's
powerful eyesight and wingspan.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His volunteers walk into the
desert.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some stay with the cars to
rescue us if necessary.

21:25.251 --> 21:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ortiz reminds us not to lose
sight of each
other, for safety.

21:32.558 --> 21:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along the coyote arroyo, the
earth is unusually
fertile for a desert.

21:36.862 --> 21:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of the most transited
border routes
precisely because there's so
much vegetation

21:41.100 --> 21:42.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for cover.

21:42.935 --> 21:48.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that means it's also
impossible to follow
Ortiz's mandate to keep an eye
on each other.

21:48.107 --> 21:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's people to my left inside
of the brush
and to my right.

21:54.547 --> 22:00.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Signs of migrants are
everywhere, tossed Red
Bulls, backpacks, dolls.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a toy.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And drug mules' shoes with
carpet strips on
the bottom to cover tracks.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are all over the place.

22:07.893 --> 22:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most prevalent are these black
gallon jugs,
which smugglers sell as a sort
of supernatural,

22:12.965 --> 22:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strength-inducing water.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm following a volunteer named
Jose Genis.

22:17.102 --> 22:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says it's hard to spot bodies
in this area
because of all the foliage.

22:21.707 --> 22:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dying migrants often crawl
beneath trees seeking
shade.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GENIS, Volunteer: And it
makes it difficult
for us to find them because they
kind of blend

22:28.614 --> 22:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, especially after a body has
been decomposing.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Genis is a Navy
veteran and
a licensed EMT.

22:33.619 --> 22:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On previous searches, he has
found dehydrated
migrants trying to enter the
U.S. illegally.

22:38.924 --> 22:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has helped save their lives,
treating them
until Border Patrol could come
take them to

22:43.729 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hospital.

22:45.497 --> 22:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE GENIS: I feel American,
but, at the same
time, I have my roots from
Mexico, so I try

22:50.736 --> 22:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help out as much as I can.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: The heat is
oppressive, even
through the trees.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are snakes and scorpions
and cattle
skeletons.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We keep losing each other.

23:01.013 --> 23:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We repeatedly have to stop and
regroup, finding
each other by blowing whistles.

23:06.785 --> 23:11.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to make it out before
sunset, when
smugglers inhabit this terrain.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're not covering nearly
enough ground.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE GENIS: If anything, we have
one-and-a-quarter
miles.

23:16.161 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: We press on.

23:19.331 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Genis and I find a Bible
crawling with insects.

23:24.870 --> 23:28.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder if the person who
dropped it made
it out of this desert alive.

23:28.407 --> 23:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of people die crossing
the border
each year from things like
dehydration or

23:34.380 --> 23:35.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hypothermia.

23:35.447 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Arizona alone, the death
count is astounding.

23:39.285 --> 23:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Official figures exclude the
countless bodies
that are never found.

23:42.621 --> 23:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ev Meade of the Trans Border
Institute says
border deaths since the 1990s
range as high

23:48.027 --> 23:49.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as 10,000.

23:49.528 --> 23:52.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EV MEADE, Trans Border
Institute: Yes, this
is a large number of people.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the kind of number
we talk about
when we talk about an armed
conflict or a

23:55.601 --> 23:57.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

23:57.303 --> 24:00.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: He says the
deaths are linked
to U.S. border fence
construction.

24:00.406 --> 24:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Border crossing deaths were
almost unheard
of until the U.S. built long
stretches of

24:04.176 --> 24:06.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
border fence in the '90s.

24:06.078 --> 24:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, about 700 miles of the
2,000-mile border
are fenced, mostly around
cities.

24:13.185 --> 24:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has forced migrants onto
remote, dangerous
routes through the desert, with
its extreme

24:18.123 --> 24:19.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
temperatures.

24:19.892 --> 24:23.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Donald Trump has
already signed
a directive to start building a
border wall.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We're going to build the wall.

24:25.464 --> 24:29.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Meade says
Trump's wall could
increase migrant deaths by
funneling them

24:29.501 --> 24:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
onto still more dangerous
crossing routs.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some are dying on the way.

24:33.572 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EV MEADE: We just really haven't
had a serious
policy discussion or a public
discussion about

24:39.078 --> 24:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the humanitarian consequences of
the building
of the wall.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Back in the
desert, we pass
barbed-wire fencing.

24:45.551 --> 24:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could it be the fencing referred
to in the
text message?

24:49.955 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Suddenly, someone finds
something.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I scramble up a hill, following
Genis.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It might be him, but we don't
know.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
First, I see the skull.

25:00.999 --> 25:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few meters away are the legs,
clothed in
pants.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The body has been torn apart by
coyotes or
some other animal.

25:08.941 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Genis says the body looks like
it's been decomposing
for about a month.

25:12.911 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marco Antonio disappeared a
month ago.

25:16.048 --> 25:22.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAXIMO GARCIA, Volunteer
(through translator):
Unfortunately, we just found
remains of a

25:22.988 --> 25:24.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human being.

25:24.089 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to investigate to
see if it's
him.

25:28.293 --> 25:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEAN GUERRERO: Garcia calls his
relatives
to tell them what we have found.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Aguilas get to work.

25:38.437 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can't touch the body.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It could be a crime scene.

25:41.707 --> 25:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They note the coordinates of the
remains,
which they will share with local
police.

25:46.512 --> 25:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials will pick up the body
and take it
to the medical examiner for DNA
analyses.

25:51.183 --> 25:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The men improvise a marker out
of a balloon
they find to help officials spot
the body.

25:57.089 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back at the vehicles, Garcia
thanks the Aguilas
for the search.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says they were the only
people willing
to help him.

26:04.229 --> 26:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jean
Guerrero
along the U.S.-Mexican border.

26:12.337 --> 26:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:21.213 --> 26:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
fighting disease
in the most polluted city on
Earth; and why

26:26.819 --> 26:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are presidential sculptures
sitting on an
empty patch of land in rural
Virginia?

26:33.292 --> 26:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today is February 20, one month
into the new
Trump administration.

26:37.863 --> 26:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an early moment to pause
and ask where
things stand.

26:41.200 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For that, we turn to our
Politics Monday team,
Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of The

26:46.472 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cook Political Report.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is Monday.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are already a month, as we
just said, Amy
and Tam, into this
administration.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's take a little bit of
stock.

26:58.050 --> 27:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, you have been looking at
the president's
appointments for big, important
positions,

27:04.089 --> 27:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the positions that have to be
confirmed by
the Senate.

27:06.592 --> 27:07.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you seeing?

27:07.860 --> 27:10.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How is he doing compared to
other presidents
at this point?

27:10.329 --> 27:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: In terms
of getting them confirmed, he is
behind schedule.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not entirely his fault.

27:16.034 --> 27:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Democrats have been
slow-walking the
nominations, in part because
they say that

27:20.606 --> 27:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of these nominees are sort
of out of
line with the mainstream.

27:24.409 --> 27:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitch McConnell, the Senate
Republican leader,
just the other day said that
this is the most

27:28.947 --> 27:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conservative Cabinet he's seen.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrats take that as
validation of their
arguments.

27:33.051 --> 27:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in terms of broadly, beyond
just the Cabinet,
the Senate-confirmed positions,
President

27:40.125 --> 27:43.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump has named 34 people so
far.

27:43.195 --> 27:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is just slightly behind
pace of President
Obama and ahead of the pace of
President Bill

27:48.934 --> 27:51.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton and President George W.
Bush.

27:51.270 --> 27:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's not actually behind,
despite many
stories saying, oh, my gosh,
he's behind.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because you look
at some of
the numbers.

27:58.644 --> 28:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said 500 -- you were telling
us 515 awaiting
confirmation, the 34 they have
named, and

28:05.350 --> 28:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 of them are still waiting.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

28:08.453 --> 28:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, there is
a lot of
focus on these numbers.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How much does it matter?

28:13.125 --> 28:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I think
there is the story about the
process and then

28:15.694 --> 28:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's the story about the
perception.

28:17.329 --> 28:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, as we learned
from Tam,
the process, he's not that far
off.

28:21.667 --> 28:27.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look, again, academic
studies, President
Obama, by his first 100 days,
only had about

28:27.539 --> 28:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
17 percent of his appointees in.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's not the pace that's the
problem.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the perception that there's
chaos here.

28:33.512 --> 28:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of it is about the people
that he's chosen
who have visions or views that
are different

28:38.884 --> 28:40.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the president's.

28:40.752 --> 28:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ideologically, we don't really
still know
where the president is on a
whole lot of issues,

28:44.089 --> 28:45.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where his North Star is.

28:45.924 --> 28:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as you pointed out,
today, you had
the secretary of defense go to
Iraq and say,

28:50.262 --> 28:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that the president
himself has said
we're going to come take your
oil.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't worry.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's one reason for that.

28:57.502 --> 29:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other is a lot of talk about
this loyalty
test, so-called loyalty test for
people who

29:01.206 --> 29:02.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want to be in high-level
positions.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every president wants somebody
that is loyal
to them.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing wrong or
different about
that.

29:07.546 --> 29:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is different, though, is
that it seems
to be taken to a level like we
haven't seen

29:11.450 --> 29:13.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have written or said
anything during
the course of the campaign that
was critical

29:16.321 --> 29:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump, you are not
going to be appointed
or you may lose a job that you
have been appointed

29:22.127 --> 29:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for once they find out what you
have actually
said.

29:25.197 --> 29:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that's what lends
this idea that
this is sort of a Cabinet or a
process in

29:32.804 --> 29:34.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chaos.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And there were so
many people
in the so-called establishment,
so the people

29:37.042 --> 29:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would be in line for these
sorts of positions,
that spoke out against Trump
during the campaign.

29:41.346 --> 29:42.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot of material out
there to work
with.

29:44.349 --> 29:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Tam, he said at his news
conference last
week: I have gotten more
accomplished in the

29:47.819 --> 29:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first four weeks of my time in
office than,
he said, some presidents have
done in their

29:51.890 --> 29:53.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entire term.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of people thought
that was hyperbole
and let him get away with a
little of that.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what has he accomplished?

29:59.331 --> 30:00.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What have we seen?

30:00.532 --> 30:04.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen a few executive
orders.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Legislation is not there yet.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Legislation is
definitely not
there yet.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at least one of those
executive orders
is on hold pending court action.

30:11.610 --> 30:16.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now President Trump, with
the travel ban,
is planning some time soon to do
a new one

30:16.181 --> 30:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would get around some of
the legal challenges.

30:19.451 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, things he has done,
the Keystone
XL pipeline and Dakota Access
pipeline, he

30:27.859 --> 30:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
signed that executive order.

30:29.428 --> 30:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not legislation, but it is
that something
that was on hold and is moving.

30:33.398 --> 30:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there is a new president in
town.

30:36.568 --> 30:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is able to do some things
just simply by
being there and by not being
Barack Obama.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy?

30:42.708 --> 30:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And there still is a
legislative
process to this.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to build a border wall,
we have got
to pay for that.

30:48.714 --> 30:51.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It has to go through a
legislative process
to appropriate that money.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You want to get rid of
Obamacare?

30:53.285 --> 30:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that there is a whole
process legislatively
that's involved with that.

30:56.555 --> 31:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's setting the ball
rolling, but you
still need Congress and, of
course, the courts

31:02.994 --> 31:04.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to go along with your
procedures.

31:04.763 --> 31:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other piece of this -- and I
feel like
a broken record, Judy -- we have
talked about

31:09.101 --> 31:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this almost every time I'm on.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:11.236 --> 31:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will forgive
you.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't think you're a broken
record.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But part of it, too,
is the reason
we're not talking so much about
what he's

31:16.541 --> 31:21.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done in three weeks is that he
steps on his
message more than anybody else
does.

31:21.847 --> 31:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, a more traditional
president would
come in and they would spend
every single

31:25.517 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
morning waking up and talking
about the two
or three or four issues they
want to talk

31:29.788 --> 31:30.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

31:30.789 --> 31:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, it's attacks on the
media.

31:33.125 --> 31:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's tweets that go even above
and beyond
just simple attacks on the
media, calling

31:37.062 --> 31:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them an enemy of the people.

31:39.264 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the issue is, if he wants
to talk about
what he's accomplished, he has
to have the

31:44.770 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discipline, the president needs
to have the
discipline to focus on those
issues day in

31:49.141 --> 31:54.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and out and let the people
around him not
put out fires, but actually
focus on talking

31:54.646 --> 31:56.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about and pushing ahead on this
agenda.

31:56.481 --> 32:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, he pulls out
of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, the trade deal, for
example,

32:00.285 --> 32:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but we don't hear -- we're not
hearing...

32:02.087 --> 32:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We hear a little bit
about it,
but there has to be a
replacement, which is,

32:04.089 --> 32:06.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he says: I'm going to do
bilateral deals.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

32:07.058 --> 32:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's see what they look like.

32:08.627 --> 32:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still -- look, we're only a
month in, but
that's what we have to look for.

32:11.296 --> 32:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, one thing
you could argue
he's done, Tam, is stir up the
anger and frustration

32:16.701 --> 32:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a lot of Democrats, or at
least people
who are opposed to him.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know if they're
Democrats or Republicans.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was another one of those
sets of protests
today.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have got a map.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, around the country,
there were a
number of protests in cities.

32:27.145 --> 32:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People called it the president's
-- this is
-- Not My President's Day.

32:32.217 --> 32:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much anti-Trump energy is
there out there?

32:36.888 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And can we tell if this is
something that
has legs?

32:39.157 --> 32:40.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is it going to last?

32:40.392 --> 32:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, clearly,
there is anti-Trump
energy.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also energy showing up
at many of
these town halls that members of
Congress

32:45.997 --> 32:47.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are having.

32:47.732 --> 32:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we don't know, if
it's real,
whether it's the new Tea Party,
whether it

32:51.036 --> 32:52.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sticks.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in part, we don't know
whether the Democratic
Party is going to be able to
capitalize on

32:55.640 --> 33:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this energy because at the
moment there is
not really a leader of the
Democratic Party.

33:00.445 --> 33:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're in the middle of an
election.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
it?

33:02.948 --> 33:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, I absolutely
agree with that.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to watch and see
where this energy
goes.

33:07.485 --> 33:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for those folks who watched
in 2009 these
raucous town halls and said,
well, it's probably

33:13.058 --> 33:15.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not going to be much of
anything, obviously,
that was proven wrong.

33:15.627 --> 33:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Tea Party.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: All of -- the Tea
Party emerged
in 2010.

33:18.797 --> 33:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump, all of his
rallies, oh, well,
maybe they're not such a big
deal.

33:22.334 --> 33:26.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, underneath all of it,
there was a
great deal of energy for Donald
Trump that

33:26.438 --> 33:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we were able to physically see.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I agree with Tamara.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got to see where this
goes.

33:30.876 --> 33:34.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenge for Democrats is
not that they
don't have energy.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a geography problem.

33:36.047 --> 33:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the states that they need to
win in order
to take control of the Senate or
in order

33:41.453 --> 33:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win seats in the House, maybe
even control
Congress, are red states on the
Senate side,

33:46.892 --> 33:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then states that are really
-- or districts
that are really Republican.

33:50.762 --> 33:51.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the challenge.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what we're seeing is two
sides really,
really fired up.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That doesn't help Democrats.

33:56.301 --> 34:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Democrats need is to see
Republicans
become depressed and fall out of
love with

34:01.206 --> 34:02.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That hasn't happened.

34:03.642 --> 34:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The geography
problem, you
have written about this.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

34:05.911 --> 34:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, great
to see you both.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

34:13.618 --> 34:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

34:19.624 --> 34:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: India's capital,
Delhi, now
outranks Beijing as the world's
most polluted

34:27.632 --> 34:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
large metropolis.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's taking a toll on its
resident's health.

34:31.469 --> 34:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as special correspondent
Fred de Sam
Lazaro reports, there are
efforts under way

34:35.707 --> 34:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make the city's air less
toxic.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing series
Agents for
Change.

34:41.846 --> 34:49.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He murmurs
and he gasps,
waiting for a spot to free up,
for a chance

34:49.854 --> 34:53.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to just breathe.

34:53.191 --> 34:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As nebulizer treatments open up
the lungs
of a handful of patients, dozens
more await

34:58.163 --> 35:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their turn at the chest clinic
in a Delhi
government hospital.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the scene outside of the
doctor's
office.

35:05.136 --> 35:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinic hours are 9:00 in the
morning until
1:00.

35:07.305 --> 35:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on a typical day, the doctor
says he sees
about 120 patients who've been
here before

35:13.044 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and 30 brand-new ones.

35:17.015 --> 35:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three to four patients are seen
at the same
time, in the same room, by Dr.
Raj Kumar and

35:22.153 --> 35:25.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his team of junior doctors and
residents.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The most common complaint?

35:27.025 --> 35:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simply change of season, the
winter, which
brings dust and tiny carbon
particulates into

35:32.564 --> 35:33.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the environment

35:33.565 --> 35:35.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAJ KUMAR, India: When there is
a change in
environment or increase in the
particulate

35:37.369 --> 35:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter and everything, these
asthmatic and
COPD patients do get
exacerbation of their

35:43.742 --> 35:45.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
symptoms.

35:45.043 --> 35:46.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They get
exacerbation
of their symptoms?

35:46.111 --> 35:47.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RAJ KUMAR: Yes.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Dr. Kumar
can do little
more than check on their
medications and advise

35:51.883 --> 35:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patients to avoid some of the
most polluted
outdoor air on the planet.

35:58.323 --> 36:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Weather and wind patterns are
blamed for trapping
pollutants over India's capital,
carbon dioxide,

36:05.830 --> 36:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ozone and fine carbon particles.

36:08.099 --> 36:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dirty fuels are the culprit from
several sources.

36:12.370 --> 36:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Automobiles are the major one.

36:17.709 --> 36:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On average, 1,400 new vehicles
are added to
Delhi's streets every day, most
now burning

36:22.881 --> 36:28.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a highly polluting diesel long
outlawed in
Europe and the United States.

36:28.620 --> 36:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By 2021, diesel fuel here will
meet European
standards.

36:34.692 --> 36:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has also promised
to shut down
old coal-fired plants and
restrict new ones.

36:40.498 --> 36:45.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And wood- and coal-burning brick
kilns has
been moved farther away from the
city.

36:45.904 --> 36:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the pollution continues.

36:50.442 --> 36:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To get an idea of how polluted
the air is,
we went to one of the cleanest
places in Delhi,

36:55.580 --> 36:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the American Embassy School.

36:57.882 --> 37:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It serves the children of
American and other
expats and diplomats.

37:02.387 --> 37:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many don face masks, but only
until they're
inside, says the director, Ellen
Stern.

37:07.325 --> 37:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN STERN, Director, American
Embassy School:
We have an air system that goes
all the way

37:10.161 --> 37:11.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the school.

37:11.963 --> 37:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have four different kinds
of filters
on it that filter out various
kinds of things.

37:17.535 --> 37:26.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Barun
Aggarwal showed
me the elaborate system his
company, BreatheEasy,

37:26.144 --> 37:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has set up in the school,
pulling out the
first layer of filter, thickly
coated with

37:31.182 --> 37:32.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a grimy soot.

37:32.851 --> 37:38.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you were to walk outside
today, this
is what is coming into your
lungs?

37:38.389 --> 37:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARUN AGGARWAL, BreatheEasy:
Absolutely.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Most of the black carbon
actually passes through
a filter like this.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is mostly dust.

37:44.462 --> 37:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the black carbon will get
trapped in the
finer particle filters.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, how old
is this accumulation?

37:49.801 --> 37:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARUN AGGARWAL: Less than six
days.

37:54.072 --> 37:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The fine
particle filters
also show stark before-and-after
evidence

37:59.177 --> 38:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the harmful air outside.

38:01.012 --> 38:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would think such systems
would be in strong
demand, but Aggarwal says, aside
from a few

38:06.317 --> 38:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buildings mostly occupied by
expats, its been
a hard sell.

38:11.122 --> 38:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among India's growing middle
class, he says,
he's there's denial or
indifference, a sense

38:15.927 --> 38:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that pollution is the price of
India's rapid
economic progress.

38:19.864 --> 38:23.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARUN AGGARWAL: The number of
myths that are
there with regards to air
pollution in India

38:23.902 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are incredible.

38:25.670 --> 38:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first one that I get by
mostly Indians
is that, if I breathe clean air
for eight

38:31.176 --> 38:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hours, then my immunity will
come down, and
when I go out, I will fall sick.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Completely wrong, because this
is -- if you
believe that, then you should be
giving your

38:38.183 --> 38:40.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
children two packets of
cigarettes to smoke
every day.

38:40.218 --> 38:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The problem,
like cigarette
smoking is, except for those
with lung disease,

38:45.890 --> 38:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the health consequences of
pollution, such
as lung and heart disease and
stroke, come

38:50.361 --> 38:51.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
later in life.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE, Environmental
Activist: It'll
happen in 10, 20, 30 years.

38:53.798 --> 38:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So if you ask a 20-year-old, is
this important,
they say, no, no, no, forget it.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have to make money.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have to get ahead in life.

39:01.372 --> 39:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Kamal
Meattle is an environmental
activist who also designed the
embassy school's

39:05.009 --> 39:06.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
filtration system.

39:06.811 --> 39:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It works well, he says, but it
is no panacea
for a city of 20-plus million
residents.

39:12.183 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: You cannot have
just air purifiers
and cleaning systems for the
people who can

39:17.322 --> 39:18.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afford them.

39:18.957 --> 39:23.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has to be for the people who
are on the
road, who are in (INAUDIBLE)
slums.

39:23.127 --> 39:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have to be dealing with
people who
go on motorcycles, go on metros,
go on buses.

39:28.099 --> 39:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the ones who are exposed
most to the
pollution.

39:31.202 --> 39:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Meattle, who
trained at
MIT, has developed lower-cost
ways to cope

39:35.974 --> 39:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the pollution, which we
measured just
outside an office building he
owns in central

39:41.012 --> 39:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Delhi, using an instrument used
to measure
fine carbon particles.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: Two-ninety, 288.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: What is the
WHO standard?

39:49.187 --> 39:50.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAMAL MEATTLE: It's 50.

39:50.455 --> 39:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, what you
have outside
your building...

39:53.558 --> 39:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: Six times.

39:55.393 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: ... is an
air quality
that's six times worse than the
WHO standard?

39:59.597 --> 40:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: That's right.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Can we step
back inside
and see what it's like inside?

40:03.935 --> 40:11.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From 290, the level dropped to
nine, thanks
not just to filters and air
purifiers, but

40:11.209 --> 40:15.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to plants, thousands of them in
this rooftop
greenhouse.

40:15.580 --> 40:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this greenhouse produces
clean air, and
each floor is pulling it in as
needed.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAMAL MEATTLE: Yes.

40:23.655 --> 40:26.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there are plants on each
floor also.

40:26.758 --> 40:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the central air cleaning
system for
the whole building.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Plants do
more than produce
oxygen, he says.

40:34.732 --> 40:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are natural air purifiers.

40:37.402 --> 40:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their roots eat bacteria and
fungi and they
absorb chemicals like
formaldehyde and benzene

40:42.974 --> 40:44.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
produced by office products.

40:44.809 --> 40:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: These are areca
palms for the
day time, bamboo palm.

40:48.946 --> 40:53.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most
importantly, he says,
these are common, fast-growing
species and

40:53.384 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be in every home for
clean air benefits
to both lungs and brains.

40:58.056 --> 41:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: Harvard and also
University
of California at Berkeley have
done studies

41:03.328 --> 41:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to show that your cognitive
abilities improve
in such an environment.

41:08.099 --> 41:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They're
small steps people
can take indoors, but he
acknowledges there's

41:12.804 --> 41:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge complex problem outside
these clean
air bubbles, not easily solved
in India's

41:18.810 --> 41:20.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chaotic democracy.

41:20.678 --> 41:25.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAMAL MEATTLE: I think its
politicians anywhere
in the world, they think the
same, that they

41:25.583 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will only act when they have
learned a solution
and it's a very straightforward
solution.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then they will implement it and
take credit
for it.

41:32.690 --> 41:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But until they find that they
don't -- or
they know that they don't have a
clean, straight

41:38.129 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solution, they will keep the
matter confused.

41:40.064 --> 41:44.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But
environmentalists
say years of lobbying seem to be
yielding

41:44.235 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some results, helped by prodding
from India's
Supreme Court, which has
compelled government

41:49.841 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies to act.

41:51.743 --> 41:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One group claiming the credit
says it distributed
pollution gauges to prominent
Delhiites.

41:56.781 --> 42:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its leader, Sunita Narain, says
campaign targets
included the court.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUNITA NARAIN, Activist: We took
the machine
in.

42:03.721 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We put the machine there.

42:05.123 --> 42:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the chief justice said, this
is unacceptable.

42:09.293 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, slowly, that sense
of unacceptable,
this is not right, this is not
fair, it's

42:16.734 --> 42:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasing the burden of health
on our children,
we have to change it, that's
happened.

42:21.572 --> 42:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But, in the
meantime,
for years to come, India's
capital and, for

42:26.544 --> 42:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that matter, most of its major
cities will
continue to be among the most
difficult places

42:31.349 --> 42:33.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Earth to breathe.

42:33.584 --> 42:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in New Delhi.

42:37.688 --> 42:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at the

42:42.427 --> 42:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of St. Thomas in
Minnesota.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Oscars are this coming
Sunday.

42:57.875 --> 43:02.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the best picture
favorites is a coming-of-age
story that's been honored for
its approach

43:02.613 --> 43:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to dealing with sexual identity
and race.

43:05.983 --> 43:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Moonlight" grabbed its latest
award last
night: best screenplay from the
Writers Guild

43:11.122 --> 43:12.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of America.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's up for eight Oscars.

43:14.625 --> 43:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down with the
filmmakers
this fall.

43:17.562 --> 43:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a second look for our
series Beyond
the Red Carpet.

43:22.066 --> 43:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a life we
don't often
see portrayed in commercial
films, a coming-of-age

43:31.876 --> 43:38.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tale of love and anguish, a
movie that's garnered
critical acclaim for the story
it tells and

43:38.049 --> 43:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the beauty and power of its
telling.

43:40.451 --> 43:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In "Moonlight," we watch Chiron
growing up
in the Liberty City neighborhood
of Miami

43:48.292 --> 43:50.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the crack epidemic is taking
hold in the
1980s.

43:50.862 --> 44:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is young, poor, black, and
coming to terms
with being gay, quietly and
painfully wrestling

44:01.706 --> 44:03.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with these identities.

44:03.674 --> 44:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story is based on the life
of Tarell Alvin
McCraney, who first wrote it as
a play and

44:09.480 --> 44:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then the screenplay for the new
film.

44:12.416 --> 44:16.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY,
Screenwriter, "Moonlight":
It's a story that I still feel
like I have

44:16.120 --> 44:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to tell, but also that I have to
explore and
to understand.

44:18.656 --> 44:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's a story rooted in
events in my
own life that I'm trying to make
sense of

44:25.530 --> 44:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and make sense of the world out
of.

44:28.399 --> 44:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for me, I always am
interested
in trying to get a group of
people to have

44:33.070 --> 44:34.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the same conversation.

44:34.772 --> 44:36.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARRY JENKINS, Director,
"Moonlight": So,
Tarell and I grew up blocks from
one another.

44:36.741 --> 44:41.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Barry
Jenkins, who
also grew up poor in Liberty
City at the same

44:42.013 --> 44:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, and with a mother fighting
addiction,
presents the story in three
separate acts,

44:47.084 --> 44:50.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using three different actors to
play Chiron.

44:50.321 --> 44:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the new Museum of African
American History
and Culture, where the film was
recently screened,

44:56.093 --> 44:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he told me he purposely kept the
actors from
watching one another.

44:59.664 --> 45:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: One of the themes
of the film
for me is about the way society
is shaping

45:04.068 --> 45:08.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these young men from our
communities, through
positive reinforcement, negative
reinforcement.

45:08.439 --> 45:09.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what masculinity looks
like.

45:09.774 --> 45:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is what it sounds like.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so much time passes between
each story
that I feel like the world has
shaped this

45:14.745 --> 45:16.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
character into a different
person.

45:16.747 --> 45:21.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I wanted to cast different
people to play
the same person, and I wanted
them to be different.

45:21.519 --> 45:26.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We watch Chiron
grow through
high school, tormented by
bullies and his

45:26.257 --> 45:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own insecurities, living with a
mother, played
by Naomie Harris, who sinks more
and more

45:31.996 --> 45:33.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into addiction.

45:33.064 --> 45:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAOMIE HARRIS, Actress: What's
wrong?

45:37.034 --> 45:38.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Nothing.

45:38.869 --> 45:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is a young
man who speaks
more loudly in his looks and
silences than

45:44.742 --> 45:46.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in words.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: The power of
cinema is that
we get to watch people, you
know?

45:48.813 --> 45:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we get to watch people,
like, in close-up.

45:51.482 --> 45:56.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if there's a scene on
the stage, the
audience can't get right in an
actor's eyes.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But in cinema, they can.

45:58.222 --> 46:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, because of that,
because of the
power of the feeling in a
person's eyes, you

46:01.759 --> 46:03.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, they can be doing --
active.

46:03.494 --> 46:06.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can be less active, and yet
revealing
so much more.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think of "Moonlight," it's
like an iceberg
film.

46:08.199 --> 46:12.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know the Hemingway phrase,
you know, 10
percent is above water, and 90
percent is

46:12.303 --> 46:13.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
below?

46:13.304 --> 46:15.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We flip it upside-down.

46:15.139 --> 46:18.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we want to show you
that 90 percent
below water, but it's moving
very, very slow.

46:18.042 --> 46:19.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, it's a patient film.

46:19.910 --> 46:23.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the character is revealing
himself by
these terms and his expressions.

46:23.648 --> 46:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES, Actor: What you
looking at
me like that for?

46:27.718 --> 46:28.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: What, man?

46:28.853 --> 46:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Come on, you just drove down
here?

46:31.989 --> 46:34.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TREVANTE RHODES: Yes.

46:34.925 --> 46:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The adult Chiron
is played
by Trevante Rhodes, a one-time
track and field

46:41.432 --> 46:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
star at the University of Texas
who only found
his way into acting his senior
year.

46:46.704 --> 46:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES: I think the
beauty of that
scene was Chiron, he didn't
know.

46:51.542 --> 46:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An outgoing and
gregarious
man, he told me how he
approached playing

46:56.547 --> 46:58.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a character so different.

46:58.349 --> 47:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES: So, for me, it
was really
just about walking around L.A.
with the three

47:02.987 --> 47:08.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks I had prior to filming
feeling as if
-- feeling as if I had a secret
to hide from

47:08.125 --> 47:09.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everyone?

47:09.694 --> 47:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were walking
around feeling
and getting into the character.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVANTE RHODES: Walking around
L.A., getting
in the character, walking
around, feeling

47:12.897 --> 47:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as if I had this secret, feeling
as if I connected
with someone.

47:17.601 --> 47:19.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would be able to see
through me.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would be able to see my
insecurities.

47:20.538 --> 47:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would be able to see this
mask that I
was putting up.

47:22.573 --> 47:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would be able to see all of
these things,
and they would take the power
away from me,

47:26.744 --> 47:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feeling as if I couldn't love
myself, because
Chiron had this self-hate.

47:31.048 --> 47:32.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And because of that, he couldn't
love others.

47:32.850 --> 47:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I feel that all of us really
relate to
Chiron in the sense that we all,
at some point,

47:38.389 --> 47:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are insecure about something in
our life,
you know?

47:41.592 --> 47:48.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm someone who I try to
make sense of
everything, and I feel like
Chiron tends to

47:48.666 --> 47:50.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do the same thing, just in a
different way.

47:50.601 --> 47:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The context is a bit different.

47:52.069 --> 47:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAOMIE HARRIS: And who is you?

47:53.838 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAHERSHALA ALI, Actor: Nobody.

47:55.639 --> 48:00.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
compelling character
is Juan, played by Mahershala
Ali, a drug

48:00.511 --> 48:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dealer stepping in as a father
figure to the
young Chiron.

48:03.714 --> 48:07.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAHERSHALA ALI: Some boys chased
him in the
cut.

48:07.318 --> 48:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's scared more than anything.

48:08.619 --> 48:12.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Juan was based on
someone McCraney
knew as a child.

48:12.089 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY: It often
pains me to
know that people sort of see
him, and go,

48:17.194 --> 48:18.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
oh, that's unusual.

48:18.963 --> 48:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I think -- when I think
back over my
life, I think, oh, but there
have been many

48:22.166 --> 48:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times I have run into many
people like him
who are reflections of him in my
mind.

48:28.005 --> 48:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hear other people go, no,
I had a person
in my life like that, too.

48:31.175 --> 48:34.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I keep thinking, well, what
are we doing?

48:34.145 --> 48:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are we silencing that story?

48:35.813 --> 48:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why -- what is happening to us
that we're
not seeing him more often?

48:39.550 --> 48:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you feel this
is a film
that could have been made five
years ago,

48:43.921 --> 48:45.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
10 years ago?

48:45.723 --> 48:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: I mean, the one
thing I can
stand up on is, I couldn't have
made it five

48:48.025 --> 48:49.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years ago or 10 years ago.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't think I was
intellectually or emotionally
capable at that point.

48:52.329 --> 48:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he had written the
piece.

48:54.832 --> 48:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't know how many people
you had shared
it with.

48:56.634 --> 48:58.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY: I'm
shaking my head
because I had it 10 years ago,
and it didn't

48:58.736 --> 49:00.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get made.

49:00.504 --> 49:02.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY JENKINS: I do think that,
right now,
there's a time in this country
when I think

49:02.606 --> 49:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, they want to see beyond
the barriers
of their own experience, you
know?

49:06.944 --> 49:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that this country is
a place where
many voices are being sought.

49:11.982 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the voice of this
character is one
in particular that people
haven't heard very

49:15.352 --> 49:16.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
often.

49:16.353 --> 49:18.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they're curious.

49:18.155 --> 49:20.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they go and they see
the film, and
they go, that voice is kind of
similar to

49:20.391 --> 49:22.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mine.

49:22.226 --> 49:24.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I kind of relate to this guy,
even though
I don't want to sit next to him
on the subway.

49:24.762 --> 49:26.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe I will next time.

49:26.597 --> 49:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARELL ALVIN MCCRANEY: And now I
think we're
in a moment where everyone has
to understand

49:30.568 --> 49:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that authenticity is key,
because, when you
come to the table truthfully,
then we can

49:36.340 --> 49:40.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of -- we see that there's
actually -- we
illuminate that there's actually
more room

49:40.044 --> 49:43.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for voices, rather than that
just one voice
that we heard previous.

49:44.014 --> 49:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Moonlight" is up
for eight
Academy Awards, including best
picture, on

49:48.185 --> 49:50.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
February 26.

49:50.120 --> 49:55.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

49:55.492 --> 50:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

50:06.036 --> 50:07.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:07.805 --> 50:13.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people collect stamps, some
coins, or,
in the case of our founding
co-anchor, Jim

50:13.143 --> 50:15.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lehrer, anything to do with
buses.

50:15.846 --> 50:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one Virginia man owns dozens
of giant
sculptures of our nation's
commanders in chief.

50:21.952 --> 50:26.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To mark President's Day, the
"NewsHour"'s
Julia Griffin has paid his
collection a visit.

50:26.724 --> 50:33.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Cracked and
crumbling, battered
and broken, these are the faces
of Presidents

50:33.697 --> 50:35.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Park.

50:35.366 --> 50:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 10-acre tourist destination
outside of
Colonial Williamsburg opened in
2004.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The main attraction?

50:42.973 --> 50:49.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forty-three Texas-sized busts of
presidents
past by Houston artist David
Adickes.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Utility contractor Howard
Hankins helped build
the original park.

50:53.317 --> 50:56.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD HANKINS, Utility
Contractor: The eyes
look like they're staring at
you, just gazing

50:56.720 --> 50:57.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at you.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's incredible how big they are
and lifelike.

50:59.657 --> 51:04.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The statues are
big, but attendance
was low, and the venture went
belly up in

51:04.762 --> 51:06.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2010.

51:06.597 --> 51:10.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Presidents Park was
forced to close,
the presidential busts were
destined for a

51:10.734 --> 51:12.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
landfill.

51:12.503 --> 51:17.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather than let that happen,
Hankins decide
to bring them here, to his
family farm in

51:17.207 --> 51:18.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia.

51:19.009 --> 51:24.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the steel and concrete
sculptures weigh
between 15,000 and 20,000
pounds, and moving

51:24.481 --> 51:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them wasn't exactly an easy
lift.

51:26.717 --> 51:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: I got a ladder,
climbed up
on top, popped a hole in their
head, and rocked

51:30.721 --> 51:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them loose from the frame with
about a 70,000-pound
machine, and picked them up and
put them on

51:35.526 --> 51:37.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my lowboys and brought them
here.

51:37.161 --> 51:40.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Abraham Lincoln,
in particular,
took a beating.

51:40.064 --> 51:43.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: Lincoln over
there, we dropped
him on his -- back of his head.

51:43.801 --> 51:47.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had tires to cushion him, and
the chain
broke, and we dropped him.

51:47.171 --> 51:49.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The busts can be
repaired.

51:49.440 --> 51:52.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for now, Hankins lets the
elements take
their toll.

51:52.643 --> 51:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: Being out of
concrete, the
water gets in and freezes and
cracks them.

51:56.680 --> 52:02.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They kind of have character the
way they are,
I mean, a little mold and moss
on them and

52:02.920 --> 52:04.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crack here and there.

52:04.788 --> 52:09.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Even though it's
private land,
intrepid explorers, with their
selfie sticks,

52:09.093 --> 52:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still flock to the farm for a
glimpse of the
stone-faced leaders.

52:12.596 --> 52:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: I have to tell
them, this
is not a site to visit.

52:16.066 --> 52:18.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm nice as I can be.

52:18.335 --> 52:20.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will let them walk around and
look.

52:20.637 --> 52:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they try to climb on them,
and no climbing
on the statues, please.

52:24.041 --> 52:28.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Rather than
relegate the busts
to an unofficial tourist
attraction, Hankins

52:28.479 --> 52:33.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently started raising funds
for a new park
outside of Richmond, one that
will include

52:33.317 --> 52:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two new additions, Presidents
Barack Obama
and Donald Trump.

52:38.255 --> 52:42.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Until then, Hankins will keep a
close watch
over his commanders in- chief.

52:42.126 --> 52:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: Yes, these guys
seem to get
along out here pretty well.

52:45.929 --> 52:46.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't see anybody fight.

52:46.930 --> 52:47.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: It's all
bipartisan, though?

52:47.931 --> 52:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: Yes, very good
people.

52:49.867 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Once they retire.

52:50.868 --> 52:52.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOWARD HANKINS: They all listen
to me.

52:52.236 --> 52:53.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:53.937 --> 52:57.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin in Croaker,
Virginia.

52:57.508 --> 53:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's another
way of thinking
about our presidents.

53:01.912 --> 53:06.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the "NewsHour" online
right now, we
test your knowledge of all
things presidential

53:06.450 --> 53:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with our President's Day quiz.

53:08.819 --> 53:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:12.756 --> 53:14.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not easy.

53:14.124 --> 53:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
