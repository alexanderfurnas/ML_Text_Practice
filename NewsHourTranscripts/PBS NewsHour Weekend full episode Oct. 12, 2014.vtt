00:11.445 --> 00:13.747
FOR SUNDAY, OCTOBER 12...

00:13.747 --> 00:14.915
A DALLAS NURSE IS DIAGNOSED WITH

00:14.915 --> 00:17.284
EBOLA AFTER TREATING THE

00:17.284 --> 00:18.085
LIBERIAN MAN WHO DIED OF THE

00:18.085 --> 00:19.286
DISEASE.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.387
THE LATEST ON THE WAR AGAINST

00:20.387 --> 00:21.321
ISIS.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.856
TONIGHT, TURKEY'S ROLE.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.957
IT'S ON THE BORDER WITH SYRIA

00:23.957 --> 00:25.058
AND IRAQ, AND ON THE FENCE ABOUT

00:25.058 --> 00:27.294
GETTING INVOLVED.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.595
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:28.595 --> 00:29.696
JEFFREY BROWN INTERVIEWS JAMES

00:29.696 --> 00:31.164
EARL JONES ABOUT HIS RETURN TO

00:31.164 --> 00:33.133
BROADWAY.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.602
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.304
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:37.304 --> 00:39.072
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:39.072 --> 00:41.041
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:41.041 --> 00:41.842
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:41.842 --> 00:42.609
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:42.609 --> 00:43.377
A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT TODAY IN THE

00:43.377 --> 00:44.344
EBOLA SCARE.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.279
A DALLAS HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE,

00:45.279 --> 00:46.513
BELIEVED TO BE A NURSE, HAS

00:46.513 --> 00:47.981
CONTRACTED EBOLA AFTER TREATING

00:47.981 --> 00:49.249
THOMAS DUNCAN, THE 42-YEAR-OLD

00:49.249 --> 00:50.851
LIBERIAN MAN WHO DAYS AGO DIED

00:50.851 --> 00:54.121
OF THE DISEASE.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.756
IT'S THE FIRST TIME EBOLA HAS

00:55.756 --> 00:57.357
BEEN TRANSMITTED IN THE UNITED

00:57.357 --> 00:58.458
STATES.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.726
DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY,

00:59.726 --> 01:00.928
THE HEAD OF THE CENTERS FOR

01:00.928 --> 01:02.362
DISEASE CONTROL CALLED THE

01:02.362 --> 01:03.797
DEVELOPMENT "DEEPLY CONCERNING"

01:03.797 --> 01:05.132
AND WARNED THAT OTHER HEALTH

01:05.132 --> 01:06.266
CARE WORKERS AT THE SAME

01:06.266 --> 01:07.734
HOSPITAL MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN

01:07.734 --> 01:09.069
INFECTED BECAUSE OF WHAT HE

01:09.069 --> 01:10.837
CALLED A BREACH OF PROTOCOL

01:10.837 --> 01:16.109
TREATING DUNCAN.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.644
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT IS POSSIBLE

01:17.644 --> 01:18.745
THAT WE WILL SEE ADDITIONAL

01:18.745 --> 01:21.815
CASES OF EBOLA.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.851
THIS IS BECAUSE THE HEALTH CARE

01:24.851 --> 01:26.486
WORKERS WHO CARED FOR THIS

01:26.486 --> 01:28.755
INDIVIDUAL MAY HAD HAVE A BREACH

01:28.755 --> 01:30.457
OF THE SAME NATURE AS THE

01:30.457 --> 01:31.558
INDIVIDUAL WHO APPEARS TO HAVE A

01:31.558 --> 01:34.494
PRELIMINARY POSITIVE TEST.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.762
THAT RISK IS IN THE 48 PEOPLE

01:35.762 --> 01:38.832
WHO ARE BEING MONITORED.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.802
THEY'RE ALL BEING TESTED DAILY.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.538
NONE OF THEM HAVE THE SYMPTOMS

01:44.538 --> 01:46.139
OR FEVER AND IN ANY OTHER HEALTH

01:46.139 --> 01:49.209
CARE WORKERS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN

01:49.209 --> 01:50.711
EXPOSED TO THIS PATIENT WHILE HE

01:50.711 --> 01:53.046
WAS BEING CARED FOR.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.748
>> Sreenivasan: 17 ADDITIONAL

01:54.748 --> 01:56.183
HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE NOW BEING

01:56.183 --> 01:57.617
MONITORED FOR SYMPTOMS OF THE

01:57.617 --> 01:58.885
DISEASE IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER

01:58.885 --> 02:01.154
48 WHO HAD CONTACT WITH DUNCAN.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.556
STATE OFFICIALS SAID THE

02:02.556 --> 02:03.957
INFECTED HOSPITAL WORKER WAS

02:03.957 --> 02:05.425
WEARING A GOWN, GLOVES, A MASK

02:05.425 --> 02:07.027
AND OTHER PROTECTIVE GEAR DURING

02:07.027 --> 02:08.795
WHAT FRIEDEN SAID WERE EXTENSIVE

02:08.795 --> 02:11.098
CONTACTS WITH DUNCAN, BUT SHE

02:11.098 --> 02:14.401
BECAME INFECTED ANYWAY.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.936
>> THE CARE OF EBOLA CAN BE DONE

02:15.936 --> 02:16.870
SAFELY BUT IT'S HARD TO DO IT

02:16.870 --> 02:19.606
SAFELY.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.608
IT REQUIRES METICULOUS AND

02:21.608 --> 02:23.810
SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION TO

02:23.810 --> 02:26.113
INFECTION CONTROL AND EVEN A

02:26.113 --> 02:27.814
SINGLE INADVERTENT INNOCENT SLIP

02:27.814 --> 02:30.884
CAN RESULT IN CONTAMINATION.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.352
>> Sreenivasan: TOP HEALTH

02:32.352 --> 02:34.087
OFFICIALS HAVE SAID A KEY TO

02:34.087 --> 02:35.155
DEFEATING EBOLA IS STOPPING IT

02:35.155 --> 02:36.156
AT ITS SOURCE-- WEST AFRICA.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.557
BUT YESTERDAY, THE DIRECTOR OF

02:37.557 --> 02:39.026
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF

02:39.026 --> 02:40.293
ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES

02:40.293 --> 02:42.963
DESCRIBED THE SITUATION THERE

02:42.963 --> 02:53.206
THIS WAY:

02:53.206 --> 02:54.241
FOR MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION IN

02:54.241 --> 02:55.776
WEST AFRICA, WHERE MORE THAN

02:55.776 --> 02:56.810
4,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED OF THE

02:56.810 --> 02:57.778
DISEASE, WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA

02:57.778 --> 02:58.478
SKYPE BY DREW HINSHAW OF THE

02:58.478 --> 02:59.146
WALL STREET JOURNAL.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.113
HE RECENTLY WAS IN SIERRA LEONE

03:00.113 --> 03:01.848
AND LIBERIA AND JOINS US TONIGHT

03:01.848 --> 03:05.752
FROM GHANA.

03:05.752 --> 03:06.586
>> THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WE HAVE

03:06.586 --> 03:08.555
HEARD HEALTH EXPERTS FROM EUROPE

03:08.555 --> 03:09.489
AND IN THE UNITED STATES SAY

03:09.489 --> 03:12.459
THAT THE PROBLEM IS MUCH WORSE

03:12.459 --> 03:14.094
IN AFRICA, THAT THERE AREN'T

03:14.094 --> 03:15.028
ENOUGH HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO

03:15.028 --> 03:15.962
DEAL WITH THIS.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.230
WHAT IS LIFE LIKE ON THE STREETS

03:17.230 --> 03:18.999
WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN VISITING?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.767
>> IT IS TERRIBLE, PARTICULARLY

03:20.767 --> 03:23.270
IN MONROVIA, LIBERIA'S CAPITAL.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.871
I WAS THERE TWO WEEKS AND EVERY

03:24.871 --> 03:26.907
TIME I LEFT THE HOTEL, I SAW

03:26.907 --> 03:29.176
SOME SIGN OF THE TRAGEDY.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.144
YOU WOULD SEE A BODY IN THE

03:31.144 --> 03:32.612
ROAD, OR A SICK PERSON

03:32.612 --> 03:34.648
SURROUNDED BAY CROWD.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.883
YOU DO SEE MORE RESPONSE TOO,

03:36.883 --> 03:38.518
YOU SEE AMBULANCES BLARING UP

03:38.518 --> 03:39.553
AND DOWN THE STREET.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.154
YOU SEE BODY TEAMS GOING TO

03:41.154 --> 03:43.090
COLLECT BODIES.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.591
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS JUST THE

03:44.591 --> 03:45.725
RESPONSE STILL SEEMS JUST SO FAR

03:45.725 --> 03:46.593
BEHIND THE DISEASE.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.829
>> DREW, YOU HAVE BEEN TO THIS

03:48.829 --> 03:49.930
REGION MULTIPLE TIMES NOW.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.364
GIVE US A SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE

03:51.364 --> 03:53.834
ON THE SCALE OF HOW BAD IT IS.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.001
>> IT IS INCREDIBLE.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.237
WHEN I FIRST WENT THERE IN EARLY

03:57.237 --> 03:58.572
AUGUST, YOU REALLY HAVE TO WORK

03:58.572 --> 04:01.775
TO FIND PEOPLE, VICTIMS, NOW,

04:01.775 --> 04:02.542
THEY FIND YOU.

04:02.542 --> 04:06.179
I MEAN, THE CASES ARE COMING

04:06.179 --> 04:08.081
EVERY THREE-WEEK, THE

04:08.081 --> 04:10.250
DIFFERENCES ARE EXTRAORDINARY.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.952
EVERYWHERE YOU GO YOU SEE THIS

04:11.952 --> 04:13.987
MASSIVE INCREASE IN EBOLA CASES.

04:13.987 --> 04:14.921
EVERY THREE WEEKS YOU CAN SIT

04:14.921 --> 04:16.623
DOWN WITH A CALCULATOR AND PLOT

04:16.623 --> 04:18.925
HOW BAD, HOW QUICKLY THIS

04:18.925 --> 04:20.927
BECOMES SORT OF A HUGE ONCE IN A

04:20.927 --> 04:23.497
GENERATION EVENT, BOTH IN WEST

04:23.497 --> 04:24.798
AFRICA AND GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.000
>> THE SCARE IS INCREASING

04:27.000 --> 04:28.068
EXTREMELY FAST AND EXTREMELY

04:28.068 --> 04:31.171
HARD TO SEE HOW THE WORLD WILL

04:31.171 --> 04:33.140
CATCH UP WITH IT IF IT DOESN'T

04:33.140 --> 04:34.107
COME SOON.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.010
>> DOES THAT MEAN THE NUMBER OF

04:37.010 --> 04:38.478
DOCTORS HAS TO DOUBLE EVERY

04:38.478 --> 04:39.846
THREE WEEKS TO DEAL WITH THE

04:39.846 --> 04:40.747
PATIENTS?

04:40.747 --> 04:42.082
>> EXACTLY.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.518
JUST MENTIONED WE NEED A 24

04:44.518 --> 04:45.252
INCREASE IN WHAT WE ARE DOING

04:45.252 --> 04:46.286
RIGHT NOW.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.890
I THINK, YOU KNOW, I AM NOT AN

04:49.890 --> 04:52.325
EPIDEMIOLOGIST BUT JUST BEING A

04:52.325 --> 04:54.361
LIBERIAN, AND SIERRA LEONE, HE

04:54.361 --> 04:56.029
IS RIGHT, THE NUMBER OF SICK

04:56.029 --> 04:57.464
PEOPLE, THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES

04:57.464 --> 04:58.765
THAT HAVE BEEN TOTALLY WIPED

04:58.765 --> 05:00.534
OUT, NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE

05:00.534 --> 05:02.369
FALLEN WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

05:02.369 --> 05:03.803
INFECTED IS JUST A HUGE INCREASE

05:03.803 --> 05:04.771
BETWEEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN

05:04.771 --> 05:06.706
AUGUST AND WHAT IT IS LIKE NOW,

05:06.706 --> 05:08.241
AND YEAH, THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS

05:08.241 --> 05:09.442
AND NURSES WE IMMEDIATE ON THE

05:09.442 --> 05:11.278
GROUND IS JUST SO VAST AND THE

05:11.278 --> 05:12.412
GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE NEED AND

05:12.412 --> 05:13.813
WHAT WE HAVE IS ONLY GETTING

05:13.813 --> 05:14.514
BIGGER.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.649
>> AT THIS POINT THEY ARE TRYING

05:15.649 --> 05:17.217
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO SORT OF

05:17.217 --> 05:19.085
STAY AT HOME AND POSSIBLY DIE

05:19.085 --> 05:20.253
THERE INSTEAD OF COMING TO A

05:20.253 --> 05:21.054
HOSPITAL?

05:21.054 --> 05:22.822
>> THERE ARE NO GOOD ANSWERS

05:22.822 --> 05:24.024
RIGHT NOW, THERE IS!

05:24.024 --> 05:26.126
DEBATE, THE CDC THINKS IT IS A

05:26.126 --> 05:28.128
REALLY HORRIBLE IDEA TO

05:28.128 --> 05:29.996
BASICALLY GIVE PEOPLE GLOVES AND

05:29.996 --> 05:32.766
PAINKILLERS AND SAY, STAY WITH

05:32.766 --> 05:34.000
YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHILE YOU

05:34.000 --> 05:38.104
HAVE EBOLA, ON THE OTHER HAND

05:38.104 --> 05:38.872
UNICEF SAYS WHAT ARE YOU GOING

05:38.872 --> 05:39.606
TO DO?

05:39.606 --> 05:40.941
PEOPLE ARE STUCK IN THEIR HOUSE

05:40.941 --> 05:42.776
WITH THEIR DYING RELATIVES.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.678
THE RULES ARE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T

05:44.678 --> 05:46.446
TOUCH THEM, YOU SHOULD LEAVE

05:46.446 --> 05:48.248
THEM IN A BEDROOM ESSENTIALLY TO

05:48.248 --> 05:50.217
DIE, BUT THAT IS JUST NOT A

05:50.217 --> 05:51.618
TENABLE OPTION FOR MOST PEOPLE

05:51.618 --> 05:52.953
WHEN THEIR LOVED ONE IS DYING TO

05:52.953 --> 05:55.555
WET TO A POINT WHERE COMPASSION

05:55.555 --> 05:56.556
OVERRULES SELF-PRESERVATION AND

05:56.556 --> 05:57.824
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW EBOLA HAS

05:57.824 --> 06:00.627
BEEN SPREADING HOUSE TO HOUSE

06:00.627 --> 06:02.028
AND UNLESS THERE IS A HUGE

06:02.028 --> 06:03.096
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

06:03.096 --> 06:04.331
HOSPITAL BEDS AVAILABLE, IT WILL

06:04.331 --> 06:05.365
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.033
>> AND I THINK THE JOURNAL HAD

06:07.033 --> 06:08.435
THIS MORNING JUST THE AMOUNT OF

06:08.435 --> 06:09.669
WATER, FOR EXAMPLE, PER PATIENT

06:09.669 --> 06:11.338
THAT IT TAKES TO TRY TO CONTAIN

06:11.338 --> 06:12.305
THIS.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.840
>> YOU NEED THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT

06:13.840 --> 06:16.042
OF LOGISTICS, BLEACH, WATER, YOU

06:16.042 --> 06:17.777
KNOW, HUNDREDS OF HEAD TO TOE

06:17.777 --> 06:20.280
SUITS EVERY DAY, FACE MASKS,

06:20.280 --> 06:21.815
GLOVES, JUST A HUGE AMOUNT OF

06:21.815 --> 06:24.050
LOGISTICS YOU NEED TO OPERATE

06:24.050 --> 06:25.819
THESE CLINICS AND THESE ARE IN

06:25.819 --> 06:27.887
COUNTRIES, IN SIERRA LEONE

06:27.887 --> 06:29.556
AIRPORT IS SO FAR FROM THE

06:29.556 --> 06:31.324
CAPITAL YOU CAN REALLY ONLY GET

06:31.324 --> 06:32.292
TO IT BY BOAT.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.526
THESE COUNTRIES ARE JUST NOT SET

06:33.526 --> 06:35.128
UP TO HAVE A HUGE INCREASE

06:35.128 --> 06:35.895
LOGISTICS LIKE THAT.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.430
>> WHAT IS THE HAPPENING TO THE

06:37.430 --> 06:39.132
SENSE OF, I GUESS, COMFORT IN

06:39.132 --> 06:41.067
THE PEOPLE, THEY MUST KNOW THE

06:41.067 --> 06:42.302
ENTIRE WORLD IS LOOKING AT THEM

06:42.302 --> 06:44.504
IN THIS WAY AND AS THE ECONOMY

06:44.504 --> 06:46.139
SLOWS DOWN ARE PEOPLE LOOKING

06:46.139 --> 06:47.240
FOR EXIT STRATEGIES?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.009
>> PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE

06:49.009 --> 06:51.711
AND PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY EDGY.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.613
EVEN WHEN PEOPLE ACCEPT THE

06:53.613 --> 06:55.448
SCIENCE OF EBOLA, THEY OBVIOUSLY

06:55.448 --> 06:57.817
ARE SCARED AND WHEN PEOPLE DON'T

06:57.817 --> 06:59.386
THEY ARE CONFUSED AND PANICKED,

06:59.386 --> 07:00.053
IT IS EXTREMELY EDGY.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.187
>> JUST THE OTHER DAY I SAW A

07:01.187 --> 07:02.255
GIANT MOB, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

07:02.255 --> 07:03.290
WAS GOING ON BUT RIGHT OUTSIDE

07:03.290 --> 07:04.758
OF AN EBOLA CLINIC, GIANT MOB

07:04.758 --> 07:06.293
APPEARED TO BE, I DON'T KNOW IF

07:06.293 --> 07:07.560
BEATING SOMEONE BUT WE TURNED

07:07.560 --> 07:10.163
THE CAR AROUND AND LEFT,

07:10.163 --> 07:12.065
EVERYWHERE YOU GO YOU JUST

07:12.065 --> 07:14.167
SORT OF SEE ANGRY MOBS UPSET

07:14.167 --> 07:15.368
ABOUT SICK PEOPLE IN THE

07:15.368 --> 07:16.603
NEIGHBORHOOD OR BODIES THAT

07:16.603 --> 07:18.238
HAVE NOT BEEN COLLECTED, PEOPLE

07:18.238 --> 07:20.106
ARE VERY, VERY FRIGHTENED.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.207
>> DREW HINSHAW OF THE WALL

07:21.207 --> 07:22.542
STREET JOURNAL, THANK YOU.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.511
>> THANK YOU.

07:24.511 --> 07:25.712
>> Sreenivasan: IN IRAQ TODAY,

07:25.712 --> 07:26.880
ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR

OUR FOCUS TONIGHT: TURKEY'S

10:00.266 --> 10:01.334
ROLE.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.435
IT'S A NATO PARTNER, BUT SO FAR

10:02.435 --> 10:03.369
IT'S BEEN RELUCTANT TO GET

10:03.369 --> 10:04.637
INVOLVED.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.672
TO HELP EXPLAIN WHY, WE ARE

10:05.672 --> 10:07.073
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY

10:07.073 --> 10:08.274
GEOFF DYER THE U.S. FOREIGN

>> SO, JEFF, SOMETIMES THESE

10:14.314 --> 10:15.648
PICTURES THAT COME OUT, YOU CAN

10:15.648 --> 10:17.951
SEE TURKISH TANKS LITERALLY JUST

10:17.951 --> 10:19.285
LOOKING OVER THE BORDER WHERE

10:19.285 --> 10:20.186
SOME OF THE FIGHTING IS

10:20.186 --> 10:20.920
HAPPENING.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.821
WHAT IS KEEPING TURKEY ON THE

10:21.821 --> 10:22.555
SIDELINES.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.823
>> WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

10:23.823 --> 10:25.692
REASONS FOR THAT, ONE THE

10:25.692 --> 10:27.527
TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS A

10:27.527 --> 10:28.928
DIFFERENT OUTLOOK TO WHAT THEIR

10:28.928 --> 10:30.163
MAIN OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE IN THE

10:30.163 --> 10:31.097
CAMPAIGN, THE U.S. IS FOCUSING

10:31.097 --> 10:32.532
JUST ON ISIS, THE TURKS WOULD

10:32.532 --> 10:34.601
LIKE THE US U.S. AND COALITION

10:34.601 --> 10:36.302
IN GENERAL TO ALSO TAKE THE

10:36.302 --> 10:38.605
FIGHT TO THE ASSAD REGIME AND

10:38.605 --> 10:39.672
NOT JUST A CAMPAIGN THAT FOCUSES

10:39.672 --> 10:40.640
ON ISIS.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.942
THE TURKS ARE ALSO TO SOME

10:42.942 --> 10:44.244
EXTENT AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE

10:44.244 --> 10:46.246
POLITICAL GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN

10:46.246 --> 10:48.681
DOMINANT IN TERMS OF A ABOUT A

10:48.681 --> 10:50.383
ANY THAT ARE SIR IDEA KURDS THAT

10:50.383 --> 10:53.119
HAVE LINKS TO A MILITANT GROUP,

10:53.119 --> 10:54.888
KURDISH MILITANT GROUP WHERE THE

10:54.888 --> 10:56.256
TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AT

10:56.256 --> 10:58.691
WAR IN THREE DECADES THAT IS

10:58.691 --> 11:00.593
SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND ALSO A

11:00.593 --> 11:02.095
BROADER SENSE OF A SLIPPERY

11:02.095 --> 11:03.763
SLOPE FOR THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT

11:03.763 --> 11:05.498
IF THEY WERE TO INTERVENE HERE,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.200
DO THEY SEND IN THEIR OWN TROOPS

11:07.200 --> 11:09.903
IF THEY MANAGE TO PUSH ISIS

11:09.903 --> 11:11.337
TROOPS, INTERVENE IN OTHER TOWNS

11:11.337 --> 11:13.706
IF THIS HAPPENS? IF ISIS GOES

11:13.706 --> 11:15.008
AWAY AND COME BACK IN A FEW

11:15.008 --> 11:16.176
WEEKS TIME WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

11:16.176 --> 11:17.644
FOR THE TURKS? ARE THEY

11:17.644 --> 11:19.913
INVOLVED AGAIN? SO ALL OF THOSE

11:19.913 --> 11:21.548
SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENTS

11:21.548 --> 11:22.882
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN

11:22.882 --> 11:24.584
GRAPPLING WITH THE TURKS ARE

11:24.584 --> 11:25.251
GRAPPLING WITH THEM AS WELL.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.220
>> WHAT SORT OF COALITION WOULD

11:27.220 --> 11:29.155
MAKE TURKEY GET INTO THIS FIGHT

11:29.155 --> 11:31.357
AND PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.393
>> WELL, THE TURKS HAVE BEEN

11:33.393 --> 11:36.129
VERY AGGRESSIVE IN THE CAMPAIGN

11:36.129 --> 11:38.164
AGAINST ASSAD, RE, IN THE

11:38.164 --> 11:39.799
CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ASSAD

11:39.799 --> 11:41.401
REGIME FOR A LAST COUPLE OF

11:41.401 --> 11:43.002
YEARS, THEY HAVE HAD A LOT OF

11:43.002 --> 11:43.836
EMPHASIS ON THAT AND THAT'S

11:43.836 --> 11:45.905
WHERE THE BIG STRATEGIC GOAL IS

11:45.905 --> 11:48.374
TO TRY TO PUSH THE U.S. IN THE

11:48.374 --> 11:50.176
DIRECTION OF NOT JUST AGAINST

11:50.176 --> 11:52.011
ISIS BUT THE ASSAD REGIME AND

11:52.011 --> 11:53.546
PUTTING MORE RESOURCES INTO

11:53.546 --> 11:54.714
OPPOSITION FORCES THAT CAN FIGHT

11:54.714 --> 11:56.683
THE ASSAD REGIME AND IF THAT

11:56.683 --> 11:58.618
HAPPENED YOU MAY SEE A TURKISH

11:58.618 --> 11:59.919
GOVERNMENT MORE WILLING TO USE

11:59.919 --> 12:02.388
SOME SORT OF MILITARY ASSETS AND

12:02.388 --> 12:03.456
EVEN INTERVENE MORE DIRECTLY IN

12:03.456 --> 12:04.157
THE CONFLICT.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.525
>> ONE OF THE CONCERNS RIGHT NOW

12:05.525 --> 12:08.394
HAS BEEN THIS HMM FREEWAY OR

12:08.394 --> 12:10.997
PIPELINE OF SUPPLY IN TERMS OF

12:10.997 --> 12:12.398
HUMANS COMING FROM, SAY, GREAT

12:12.398 --> 12:14.167
BRITAIN OR THE WEST AND WANTING

12:14.167 --> 12:16.936
TO JOIN FORCES OF ISIS, IT SEEMS

12:16.936 --> 12:19.405
A KEY WAY STATION IS TURKEY, IS

12:19.405 --> 12:20.873
TURKEY STOPPING THAT FLOW?

12:20.873 --> 12:22.475
>> WELL, THAT'S A VERY HARD

12:22.475 --> 12:23.309
QUESTION TO ANSWER.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.545
I MEAN, YOU G

12:25.545 --> 12:27.046
REPORTS ON THAT FRONT.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.081
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

12:28.081 --> 12:30.216
THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN

12:30.216 --> 12:33.786
ROOTS, IN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT

12:33.786 --> 12:36.122
SAYS IT HAS NOT ONLY ON THE

12:36.122 --> 12:36.923
FIGHTERS BUT THE FINANCIAL

12:36.923 --> 12:38.858
ASPECT OF IT, IT IS A VERY OPEN

12:38.858 --> 12:41.894
AND POROUS BORDER, SMUG KING IN

12:41.894 --> 12:43.696
ROOTS BETWEEN SYRIA AND TURKEY

12:43.696 --> 12:45.365
THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR

12:45.365 --> 12:47.133
CENTURIES, IT IS NOT EASY TO

12:47.133 --> 12:48.101
JUST CLAMP DOWN OVERNIGHT.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.669

13:07.787 --> 13:10.923
DURING A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH

13:10.923 --> 13:11.958
NEWSHOUR'S JEFFREY BROWN, HE

13:11.958 --> 13:13.092
CONFIDED THAT THE WORDS HE

13:13.092 --> 13:14.093
SPEAKS DON'T ALWAYS COME EASILY

13:14.093 --> 13:23.770
TO HIM.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.471
>> I WAS TO STAND THERE, SAY THE

13:27.206 --> 13:31.644
FOUR, FIVE...

13:31.644 --> 13:32.612
AND THEN FALL OVER-- FALL FLAT

13:32.612 --> 13:34.781
OVER.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.082
THAT WAS EXITING.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.318
AND THE KIDS LIKED THAT, TOO.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.319

14:37.610 --> 14:39.645
A GREAT TIME.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.115

14:42.115 --> 14:43.549
BUT ALSO IT HAPPENS TO BE A

14:43.549 --> 14:45.017
CHOICE THAT THE DIRECTOR AND I

MADE.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.154
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE FIRST

15:03.669 --> 15:04.604
VANDERHOFF, YOU HAVE NEVER PAID

15:04.604 --> 15:06.272
AN INCOME TAX.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.174
>> THAT'S RIGHT

15:08.174 --> 15:08.741
>> WHY NOT?

15:08.741 --> 15:13.412
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.048
GRANDPA, THE PATRIARCH OF AN

15:16.048 --> 15:17.483
UNUSUALLY HAPPY AND WACKY FAMILY

15:17.483 --> 15:18.684
IN DEPRESSION-ERA NEW YORK WHOSE

15:18.684 --> 15:20.319
MEMBERS LIVE LIFE AS THEY

15:20.319 --> 15:21.921
PLEASE-- NOT PAYING INCOME

15:21.921 --> 15:23.790
TAXES, NOT WORKING, SIMPLY

15:23.790 --> 15:27.426
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.295
ONE REVIEW SAID JONES "INFUSES

15:29.295 --> 15:32.231
EVERY WORD WITH A STEADY GRACE".

15:32.231 --> 15:34.133
BUT JONES TOLD US FOR AS LONG AS

15:34.133 --> 15:35.635
HE CAN REMEMBER HE'S BEEN

15:35.635 --> 15:37.203
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WORDS, A MAN

15:37.203 --> 15:38.604
WITH DIFFICULTY EXPRESSING

15:38.604 --> 15:40.406
HIMSELF.

15:40.406 --> 15:41.741
HOW CAN YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS

15:41.741 --> 15:43.476
INARTICULATE?

15:43.476 --> 15:44.310
YOU DON'T...

15:44.310 --> 15:45.578
>> OH...

15:45.578 --> 15:46.546
>> Reporter: YOU... YOU THINK OF

15:46.546 --> 15:47.580
YOURSELF THAT WAY?

15:47.580 --> 15:48.581
>> UH-HUH.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.782
>> Reporter: REALLY?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.117
>> OH, AT PARTIES, YEAH.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.285
I'M--I'M GOOD AT LISTENING.

15:52.285 --> 15:57.423
THAT I LEARNED WELL.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.991
AND KEEPING UP IS... COULD BE...

15:58.991 --> 16:00.893
CAN BE A CHORE.

16:00.893 --> 16:01.794
>> Reporter: IT BEGAN EARLY,

16:01.794 --> 16:02.662
DURING WHAT HE'S DESCRIBED AS A

16:02.662 --> 16:05.531
DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.400
HIS FATHER ABANDONED THE FAMILY

16:07.400 --> 16:09.001
AND HE WAS RAISED BY PRIMARILY

16:09.001 --> 16:11.804
BY HIS GRANDPARENTS, FIRST IN

16:11.804 --> 16:12.638
MISSISSIPPI AND THEN ON A FARM

16:12.638 --> 16:14.040
IN MICHIGAN.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.041
AND HE DEVELOPED A SEVERE

16:15.041 --> 16:21.180
STUTTER.

16:21.180 --> 16:21.914
>> PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THE

16:21.914 --> 16:22.915
HOUSE AND THERE'D BE

16:22.915 --> 16:24.116
INTRODUCTIONS MADE AND I

16:24.116 --> 16:26.686
COULDN'T INTRODUCE MYSELF.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.854
>> Reporter: IT WAS THAT BAD?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.188
>> YEAH.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.089
>> Reporter: IT'S KIND OF

16:30.089 --> 16:30.890
REMARK...

16:30.890 --> 16:31.924
>> I FOUND IT WAS OH, SO GOOD

16:31.924 --> 16:33.125
SOMETIMES BECAUSE... SILENCE

16:33.125 --> 16:34.227
ISN'T BAD.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.294
IT'S GOOD TO LISTEN.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.696
AND I LEARNED TO LISTEN.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.897
>> Reporter: JONES SAYS IT WAS,

16:37.897 --> 16:39.131
IN PART, THAT VERY THING, THAT

16:39.131 --> 16:40.266
DROVE HIM TOWARD ACTING.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.667
A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER HAD HELPED

16:41.667 --> 16:43.202
HIM OVERCOME HIS STUTTER BY

16:43.202 --> 16:44.337
HAVING HIM RECITE POETRY AT THE

16:44.337 --> 16:45.638
FRONT OF THE CLASS.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.306
IN THE EARLY 1950s, JONES HAD

16:47.306 --> 16:48.241
JUST GOTTEN OUT OF THE ARMY AND

16:48.241 --> 16:49.175
DECIDED TO GIVE NEW YORK THEATRE

16:49.175 --> 16:51.611
A TRY.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.179
>> AND I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS

16:53.179 --> 16:55.948
LANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

16:55.948 --> 16:59.886
REVOLUTION THAT INVOLVED THEATER

16:59.886 --> 17:01.454
BEING CHANGED TO EVERY MAN.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.923
I JUST CAME AND WALKED INTO IT

17:03.923 --> 17:04.957
LIKE A DUMMY OUTTA THE ARMY.

17:04.957 --> 17:05.791
AND THIS STUFF IS GOING ON

17:05.791 --> 17:07.426
AROUND ME.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.694
SUDDENLY, I BEGAN TO PUT IT

17:08.694 --> 17:09.695
TOGETHER.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.731
AND IT'S QUITE WONDERFUL.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.766
>> Reporter: IT WAS A TIME WHEN

17:13.766 --> 17:15.534
BROADWAY EMBRACED STORIES ABOUT

17:15.534 --> 17:16.736
REGULAR PEOPLE LIKE WILLY LOMAN,

17:16.736 --> 17:18.204
THE PROTAGONIST IN ARTHUR

17:18.204 --> 17:19.705
MILLER'S "A DEATH OF A SALESMAN"

FAMOUSLY PERFORMED BY MARLON

17:23.442 --> 17:26.512
BRANDO.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.815
BUT IN JONES'S VERY FIRST SMALL

17:29.815 --> 17:32.718
ROLE ON BROADWAY IN 1958, IN

17:32.718 --> 17:34.720
"SUNRISE AT CAMPOBELLO," A PLAY

17:34.720 --> 17:37.189
BASED ON PRESIDENT FRANKLIN

17:37.189 --> 17:38.724
ROOSEVELT'S STRUGGLE WITH POLIO,

17:38.724 --> 17:39.558
AN OLD PROBLEM CAME BACK TO

17:39.558 --> 17:43.329
HAUNT HIM.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.497
>> I WAS PLAYING A HOUSEBOY AND

17:44.497 --> 17:45.531
I HAD A SCENE.

17:45.531 --> 17:46.832
I CAME INTO ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.502
I SAID, "MRS. ROOSEVELT, SUPPER

17:49.502 --> 17:51.737
IS SERVED."

17:51.737 --> 17:56.409
WELL, I GOT AS FAR AS "MRS."

17:56.409 --> 17:59.178
WE'RE OFTEN HUNG ON THE M WORD,

17:59.178 --> 18:00.713
THE MAMA WORD OR WHATEVER YOU

18:00.713 --> 18:02.848
WANNA CALL IT, US STUTTERERS.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.083
I THINK THE AUDIENCE KNEW WHAT

18:04.083 --> 18:05.384
WAS HAPPENING.

18:05.384 --> 18:09.622
IT WAS... IT WAS A PLAY.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.756
THEY BOUGHT TICKETS.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.091
AND I'M UP THERE ACTING.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.526
AND I CAN'T TALK.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.760
MY LINE WAS SIMPLE, "MRS.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.662
ROOSEVELT, SUPPER IS SERVED."

18:16.662 --> 18:19.966
AND I EXITED.

18:19.966 --> 18:20.933
AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME IT'S

18:20.933 --> 18:23.536
EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.804
>> Reporter: IT MAY SURPRISE YOU

18:24.804 --> 18:25.905
THAT JONES, WITH UNDOUBTEDLY ONE

18:25.905 --> 18:26.872
OF THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE VOICES

18:26.872 --> 18:28.207
IN THE WORLD...

18:28.207 --> 18:30.443
>> THIS IS CNN.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.510

STRUGGLES WITH STUTTER TO THIS

18:32.979 --> 18:34.513
DAY.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.115
BUT IT HASN'T HELD HIM BACK ON

18:36.115 --> 18:38.784
STAGE, FILM, OR TELEVISION.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.619
JONES HAS WON THREE EMMY AWARDS,

18:40.619 --> 18:43.222
AN HONORARY ACADEMY AWARD AND

18:43.222 --> 18:45.358
TWO TONY AWARDS FOR HIS STAGE

19:00.139 --> 19:00.973
LIKED YOU OR NOT.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.308

19:02.308 --> 19:05.978
DOING RIGHT BY YOU.

19:05.978 --> 19:06.912

19:06.912 --> 19:08.047
OTHER NOTABLE ROLES INCLUDING

19:08.047 --> 19:09.882
OTHELLO ON BROADWAY...

MODERN FILM CLASSIC "FIELD OF

19:14.487 --> 19:15.588

19:15.588 --> 19:16.956
JONES TOLD US THAT EARLY ON, HIS

19:16.956 --> 19:17.923
ROLES WERE LIMITED BECAUSE OF

19:17.923 --> 19:20.226
HIS RACE.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.160
>> I'M GOING TO BUST IT WIDE

OPEN AND THE WE ARE ALL GOING TO

19:22.261 --> 19:24.296
GO OUT FOR A CHAMPAGNE LUNCH.

19:24.296 --> 19:25.664
>> Reporter: BUT DESPITE BEING

19:25.664 --> 19:26.832
ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT

19:26.832 --> 19:28.467
AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTORS OF HIS

19:28.467 --> 19:29.502
GENERATION, JONES HAS NEVER

19:29.502 --> 19:30.503
DEFINED HIS CAREER IN RACIAL

19:30.503 --> 19:31.704
TERMS.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.172
>> I NEVER THOUGHT THERE WAS A

19:33.172 --> 19:35.374
THING... SUCH A THING AS BLACK

19:35.374 --> 19:36.842
THEATER OR AFRICAN AMERICAN

19:36.842 --> 19:38.744

19:43.749 --> 19:45.117
ALL THE OTHER ACTORS PLAYING

19:45.117 --> 19:46.619
MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY ARE WHITE.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.988
BUT THE 1936 VERSION OF THE PLAY

19:48.988 --> 19:51.223
DID HAVE SOME RACIAL REFERENCES,

19:51.223 --> 19:52.858
ONE OF WHICH MADE JONES

19:52.858 --> 19:57.897
UNCOMFORTABLE.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.265
>> MY QUESTIONS WERE, FOR

PEOPLE, IT'S... TWO PEOPLE WHO

20:05.971 --> 20:07.106
WERE SERVANTS.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.374
WHEN THE GIRL WHO PLAYS MY

20:08.374 --> 20:09.375
DAUGHTER, PENNY, SAYS, "OH,

20:09.375 --> 20:10.476
THEY'RE SO CUTE.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.343
THEY'RE A LITTLE, LIKE, PORGY

20:16.182 --> 20:18.050
FIRST PERFORMED IN 1935,

PORTRAYED AFRICAN AMERICANS IN

20:19.585 --> 20:21.287
WAYS THAT SOME-- THEN AND NOW--

20:21.287 --> 20:24.924
FELT WERE RACIST STEREOTYPES.

'CAUSE WHY BEG THE QUESTION?

20:29.595 --> 20:30.496

20:30.496 --> 20:32.231
ULTIMATELY TAKEN OUT.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.469
SUCCESS ON STAGE AND SCREEN IN

20:36.469 --> 20:38.771
MORE THAN 200 ROLES, JONES IS

20:38.771 --> 20:40.206
PROBABLY STILL BEST KNOWN FOR

20:40.206 --> 20:41.440
BEING THE VOICE OF DARTH VADER

20:41.440 --> 20:44.877
IN THE STAR WARS TRILOGY.

20:44.877 --> 20:45.978
AND THE FIRST MOVIE, RELEASED IN

20:45.978 --> 20:47.179
1977, MAY HAVE BEEN HIS EASIEST

20:47.179 --> 20:50.149

WASN'T A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

20:54.720 --> 20:55.754
I MEAN, YOU RECORDED IT FAIRLY

20:55.754 --> 20:57.089
QUICKLY, I UNDERSTAND, AND...

21:14.073 --> 21:15.474
ROLES HE'S MOST PROUD OF,

21:15.474 --> 21:16.709
THOUGH, ARE ONES IN WHICH HE

21:16.709 --> 21:18.577
PLAYED CHARACTERS WHO, LIKE

21:18.577 --> 21:21.847
HIMSELF, STRUGGLE WITH LANGUAGE.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.549
MEN LIKE LENNIE IN "OF MICE AND

DON'T ARTICULATE MUCH, PEOPLE

LIKE ME, WHO DON'T HAVE

21:48.641 --> 21:51.577
LANGUAGE, WHO ARE INARTICULATE.

21:51.577 --> 21:52.378

21:52.378 --> 21:54.213
DAISY."

21:54.213 --> 21:55.314
HOKE INVENTS A LANGUAGE OF HIS

21:55.314 --> 21:57.716
OWN.

21:57.716 --> 21:58.817
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE

ENGLISH AS YOU AND I ARE DOING

21:59.752 --> 22:00.486
RIGHT NOW.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.854
