GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Republican
candidates take back their
pledge to support

00:11.478 --> 00:15.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the party's nominee, as New York
and Wisconsin
become campaign grounds.

00:16.016 --> 00:20.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
Former secretary of state
Madeleine Albright

00:20.754 --> 00:25.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and former National Security
Adviser Stephen
Hadley, back from a recent trip
to the Middle

00:25.659 --> 00:27.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
East, talk about a way forward.

00:27.928 --> 00:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And how California's
Coachella
Valley struck a unique deal
between developers

00:33.367 --> 00:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and conservationists to protect
its desert
life.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KIRK, Coachella Valley
Association of
Governments: In a lot of places
throughout

00:38.572 --> 00:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country, we know that we
have done development
perhaps in a rash and vast way.
In the Coachella

00:46.380 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Valley, we didn't want to do
that.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.951 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:55.355 --> 01:08.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wisconsin's primary
is less than
a week away, and the stakes keep
getting higher,

01:08.335 --> 01:11.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as party divisions appear to
grow more deep.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang is in Wisconsin for
us, and reports
on the day's events.

01:14.775 --> 01:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The Republican Party hasn't
treated me properly.

01:18.578 --> 01:23.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump started
his day in
Green Bay, touting his strength
with voters

01:23.817 --> 01:27.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and seeming to warn party
leaders not to block
his nomination.

01:27.521 --> 01:31.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They haven't
treated me fairly.
But I have got millions of more
votes and

01:31.725 --> 01:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have got a movement going on.
Millions
of people are voting that didn't
vote before.

01:36.396 --> 01:41.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That followed last
night's CNN
town hall, where the Republicans
backed off

01:41.234 --> 01:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
previous commitments to support
their party's
eventual nominee.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: Do you
continue to pledge
whoever the Republican nominee
is?

01:45.339 --> 01:46.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No. I don't
anymore.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDERSON COOPER: You don't?

01:49.176 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, we'll see who
it is.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Let me tell you my solution to
that.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:55.215 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Donald is not
going to be the
GOP nominee. We're going to beat
him.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:00.454 --> 02:02.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
If the nominee is somebody that
I think is

02:02.255 --> 02:06.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really hurting the country and
dividing the
country, I can't stand behind
them, but we

02:06.159 --> 02:07.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a ways to go.

02:07.995 --> 02:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Trump argued
that he, not
Ted Cruz, would be the strongest
choice against

02:12.265 --> 02:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrat Hillary Clinton in the
fall.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He will not be
able to beat
Hillary. And believe me, the one
person she

02:17.804 --> 02:22.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't want to run -- and I
know this for
a fact -- the one person she
doesn't want

02:22.275 --> 02:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to run against is Donald Trump.

02:24.077 --> 02:28.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump again defended
his campaign
manager, who's been charged with
misdemeanor

02:28.382 --> 02:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
battery, for allegedly grabbing
reporter Michelle
Fields.

02:31.852 --> 02:37.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By contrast, Cruz was in Madison
for what
he called a celebration of
women. He appeared

02:37.724 --> 02:40.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with his wife, Heidi, and former
rival Carly
Fiorina.

02:40.627 --> 02:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: I have news for
the Democratic
Party. Women are not a special
interest. Women

02:46.666 --> 02:51.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are a majority of the United
States of America.
This campaign, at its core, I
believe, is

02:51.905 --> 02:58.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about three issues: jobs,
freedom and security.
And women, every bit as much as
men, care

02:58.512 --> 03:01.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about jobs, freedom and
security.

03:01.048 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: John Kasich stumped
in New York
state, which votes on April 19,
stopping in

03:05.852 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Queens this afternoon.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: Nobody is
going to have
enough delegates going into the
convention.

03:10.991 --> 03:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz now needs almost 90
percent of all
the remaining delegates to be
the nominee.

03:16.063 --> 03:21.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not going to happen.
Trump needs about
55 percent or more. That's not
going to happen.

03:21.935 --> 03:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton was also in
New York, which
she represented in the U.S.
Senate. Campaigning

03:27.908 --> 03:30.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Harlem, she blasted Trump for
bluster and
bigotry.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
When a candidate for president
says we can

03:35.015 --> 03:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solve America's problems by
building walls,
discriminating against people
based on their

03:40.821 --> 03:46.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
religion and turning against
each other, well,
New Yorkers know better.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:49.429 --> 03:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Our
diversity is a
strength, not a weakness.

03:57.204 --> 04:02.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Back in Wisconsin,
Clinton's Democratic
rival, Bernie Sanders, insisted
he's got the

04:02.142 --> 04:04.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
momentum at a town hall in
Madison.

04:04.177 --> 04:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I think there was a poll just
came out today

04:08.482 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Wisconsin, similar to other
polls, which
had us beating Trump by big-time
double-digit

04:12.018 --> 04:12.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
numbers.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:14.354 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: In every
one of these
polls, virtually every one, not
every one,

04:16.857 --> 04:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost every one, we do far
better against
Trump and the other Republican
candidates

04:22.496 --> 04:24.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than does Hillary Clinton.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:26.199 --> 04:30.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tonight, Sanders
continues to campaign
in Wisconsin. And Trump and
Kasich appear

04:30.504 --> 04:32.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in town halls hosted by MSNBC.

04:32.906 --> 04:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Milwaukee.

04:37.711 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump pretaped his
town hall appearance
this afternoon, and caused a new
stir over

04:42.816 --> 04:47.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abortion. We will look more
closely at how
he's managed to keep the
spotlight on himself

04:47.621 --> 04:49.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

04:49.556 --> 04:55.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Obama commuted prison sentences
for 61 drug

04:55.195 --> 04:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offenders, highlighting his push
to overhaul
the criminal justice system.
More than a third

04:59.733 --> 05:04.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were serving life sentences.
Most will now
be freed at the end of July.

05:04.137 --> 05:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the announcement, Mr.
Obama lunched
with people who had had their
sentences commuted

05:09.276 --> 05:11.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
previously.

05:11.077 --> 05:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It is my strong belief that, by
exercising

05:14.881 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these presidential powers, I
have the chance
to show people what a second
chance can look

05:22.923 --> 05:28.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, that I can highlight the
individuals
who are getting these second
chances and doing

05:28.061 --> 05:29.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extraordinary things with their
lives.

05:29.963 --> 05:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In all, President
Obama has
now commuted the sentences of
almost 250 inmates.

05:35.302 --> 05:39.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House said that is
more than the
previous six presidents
combined.

05:39.072 --> 05:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The city of Newark,
New Jersey,
agreed today to reform the way
its police

05:43.910 --> 05:49.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treat minorities. Federal
investigators found
the police made unconstitutional
stops and

05:49.349 --> 05:52.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
arrests and resorted to
excessive force too
often.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF:

05:54.487 --> 05:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under a settlement with the
Justice Department,
the police will revise its
policies, and officers

05:57.557 --> 06:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will start wearing body cameras.

06:00.327 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two Minneapolis police officers
will face
no charges in the death of a
black suspect

06:05.398 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sparked protests. Jamar
Clark was fatally
wounded in a struggle with the
officers last

06:11.171 --> 06:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
November. Today, the county
prosecutor said
he had concluded that the pair,
Mark Ringgenberg

06:16.810 --> 06:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Dustin Schwarze, had reason
to fear for
their lives.

06:20.513 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE FREEMAN, Hennepin County
District Attorney:
In this case, officer
Ringgenberg subjectively

06:24.217 --> 06:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believed that Clark had or was
in the process
of obtaining control of his
weapon, and that

06:29.155 --> 06:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were Clark able to remove the
weapon from
his holster, both Ringgenberg
and Schwarze

06:33.627 --> 06:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
likely would be shot.
Ringgenberg's subjective
belief is also objectively
reasonable.

06:40.734 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some community
activists decried
the decision and called for new
protests.

06:46.640 --> 06:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The governor of
Virginia has vetoed
a bill that would allow clergy
and others

06:51.344 --> 06:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refuse to marry same-sex couples
on the basis
of religious beliefs. The
Republican-controlled

06:57.117 --> 07:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legislature approved the bill,
but Democratic
Governor Terry McAuliffe said
it's unconstitutional.

07:02.222 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Earlier this week, the
Republican governor
of Georgia vetoed a similar
bill.

07:06.860 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Iran today,
the supreme
leader defended test-firing
ballistic missiles

07:12.198 --> 07:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and warned against weakening
that effort.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted a
statement

07:17.237 --> 07:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
online, saying: "Those who say
the future
is in negotiations, not in
missiles, are either

07:22.942 --> 07:24.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ignorant or traitors."

07:24.744 --> 07:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was seen as a slap at
former President
Akbar Rafsanjani, who'd called
for dialogue,

07:30.583 --> 07:32.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not missiles.

07:32.352 --> 07:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Migrant sailings
from Turkey to
Greece surged today just before
officials

07:35.655 --> 07:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
begin enforcing an agreement to
send them
back. Nearly 770 people arrived
in the last

07:41.394 --> 07:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
24 hours, and as Greek
authorities dealt with
them, the U.N.'s refugee chief
made a fresh

07:47.133 --> 07:48.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appeal in Geneva.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: We must find a way
to manage

07:50.870 --> 07:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this crisis in a more humane,
organized and
equitable manner, and this is
only possible

07:58.678 --> 08:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if the international community
is united and
in agreement on how to move
forward.

08:03.783 --> 08:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, as the
weather warms,
the migrant flow from North
Africa is also

08:08.355 --> 08:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picking up. The Italian coast
guard and navy
rescued more than 1,300 people
just today.

08:14.427 --> 08:18.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Japanese
government regulators

is supposed

08:24.371 --> 08:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to freeze the ground and block

A massive earthquake and tsunami

agreed to buy Japan's struggling
electronics

08:44.090 --> 08:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brand Sharp for $3.5 billion.
It's the first
foreign takeover of a major
Japanese electronics

08:51.698 --> 08:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
producer. Foxconn also assembles

JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the Food
and Drug Administration eased
the rules for

08:59.105 --> 09:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the abortion-inducing drug
Mifeprex in order
to expand access. Women may now
take the drug

09:05.578 --> 09:11.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later in pregnancy and make
fewer doctor's
visits. FDA's changes are
expected to undermine

09:11.951 --> 09:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
existing restrictions in several
states.

09:14.721 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wall Street managed
to keep its
rally going today. The Dow Jones
industrial

09:19.125 --> 09:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average was up 83 points to
close at 17716.
The Nasdaq rose 22 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

09:27.567 --> 09:29.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
added nearly nine.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And prominent MIT
economist
Lester Thurow has died. He
focused on income

09:34.674 --> 09:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distribution early in his
career, turned to
the challenges of globalization,
and in recent

09:39.979 --> 09:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years warned of the growing gap
between rich
and poor. He also wrote several
bestselling

09:44.717 --> 09:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
books on economic policy for
general audiences.
Lester Thurow was 77 years old.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
why Donald
Trump's rhetoric is appealing to
millions

09:56.596 --> 10:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of voters; Madeleine Albright
and Stephen
Hadley discuss the U.S. role in
the Middle

10:01.468 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East; a peace deal that could
change Colombia's
cocaine trade; and much more.

10:14.447 --> 10:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump has now
been leading
in the polls for eight months,
making him

10:22.555 --> 10:26.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the prohibitive favorite to win
the Republican
Party nomination this summer.

10:26.926 --> 10:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His celebrity has driven media
coverage, which
in turn has boosted his
celebrity. The result?

10:32.966 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times found Trump
has received
nearly $2 billion of free media
attention

10:38.438 --> 10:44.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the campaign, nearly
twice as much
as the original entire 17-member
field.

10:44.544 --> 10:49.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, he once again
demonstrated one of his
greatest skills, hijacking the
news cycle

10:49.749 --> 10:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a provocative comment, this
one about
abortion.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: Do you
believe in punishment
for abortion, yes or no, as a
principle?

10:56.956 --> 11:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The answer is that there has to
be some form

11:01.160 --> 11:01.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of punishment.

11:01.861 --> 11:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: For the woman?

11:02.862 --> 11:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Yes. There has to
be some form.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: Ten cents, 10
years, what?

11:05.231 --> 11:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't know.
That, I don't
know.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

11:07.300 --> 11:07.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, why not?

11:07.967 --> 11:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't know.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: You take
positions on everything
else.

11:10.937 --> 11:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I find -- I do
take positions
on everything else. It's a very
complicated

11:11.905 --> 11:13.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Today, both pro- and
anti-abortion
forces rejected Trump's latest
controversial

11:17.877 --> 11:19.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statement.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why does he survive? And how
has he upended
politics?

11:22.682 --> 11:27.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We zero in on what's behind
Trump's appeal
and what's changed about the
electorate with

11:27.053 --> 11:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stuart Stevens, Mitt Romney's
chief political
strategist in the 2012 election,
McKay Coppins,

11:33.226 --> 11:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a senior writer for BuzzFeed
News who has
covered Trump and is the author
of a book

11:37.630 --> 11:42.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Republican Party's
efforts to take
back the White House called "The
Wilderness,"

11:42.302 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Kathleen Hall Jamieson,
professor of communications
and director of the Annenberg
Public Policy

11:47.307 --> 11:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Center at the University of
Pennsylvania.

11:50.577 --> 11:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, how much
has Donald
Trump exploded politics as
usual?

11:55.114 --> 11:57.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON,
Director, Annenberg
Public Policy Center: Donald
Trump has changed

11:58.017 --> 12:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way we talk about politics,
the kinds
of things that are covered in
news, and the

12:02.188 --> 12:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways in which politicians gain
access.

12:04.290 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, his free airtime is
what anybody
else in an earlier campaign
would have paid

12:08.328 --> 12:10.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for and called advertising.

12:10.096 --> 12:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: McKay Coppins, has
he changed
inherently the way the GOP is
formulated,

12:17.270 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way it functions, the kinds
of candidates
it will nominate in the future?

12:20.907 --> 12:26.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MCKAY COPPINS, BuzzFeed: I think
he's exploited
a shift in the GOP over the past
eight years

12:26.279 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or so in the Obama era, which is
basically
the crumbling of the traditional
GOP establishment,

12:31.684 --> 12:36.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party committees, the
fund-raisers, the
donors, who used to wield all
the influence,

12:36.789 --> 12:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and now has kind of taken
advantage of this
new right-wing
counterestablishment that is

12:41.194 --> 12:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made up of new right-wing media
outfits and
pressure groups, and really
figured out how

12:46.432 --> 12:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to court them and ride a wave of
influence
into becoming basically, you
know, the six-,

12:52.939 --> 12:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seven-, eight-month front-runner
of the Republican
Party nomination fight.

12:56.676 --> 13:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stuart Stevens, it
hasn't even
been four years since you were
helping to

13:00.713 --> 13:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run Mitt Romney's campaign, yet
so much seems
to have changed. You have been
pretty outspoken

13:05.585 --> 13:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in your criticism of Donald
Trump.

13:07.587 --> 13:11.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But take a step back as an
analyst and tell
me, why do you think this is
right now?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART STEVENS, Former Romney
Campaign Senior
Adviser: Well, I think there's
two ways to

13:14.227 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
look at Donald Trump.

13:16.029 --> 13:23.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is that he's a function of a
weak field
that miscalculated what I would
call the "Guns

13:23.202 --> 13:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of August" -- I refer to that
great book about
the beginning of World War I. No
one wanted

13:28.374 --> 13:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to happen, and yet it's
happening.

13:31.044 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other would be that actually
maybe it's
not that unusual that we have
seen, in crowded

13:36.582 --> 13:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fields, where Republican primary
electorate
will nominate someone who says
things and

13:42.355 --> 13:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does things that makes him
unelectable in
the fall. We saw this in Indiana
with Mourdock

13:46.492 --> 13:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Senate race. We saw it
with Todd Akin
in the Missouri Senate race,
with Sharron

13:52.465 --> 13:54.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Angle in Nevada.

13:54.200 --> 13:59.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what could be happening here
is just,
on a national scale, we have
seen played out

13:59.372 --> 14:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in states, which might not be
that crazy,
because, really, a national
primary is not

14:05.445 --> 14:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really a national primary, but a
series of
states that are playing out.
It's the same

14:09.816 --> 14:15.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that vote in the states.
We just haven't
seen it happen in a presidential
primary.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One of the things,
Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, which seems different
about Donald

14:19.525 --> 14:24.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is, he has great skill at
changing the
topic and of stealing the
headline from anybody

14:24.897 --> 14:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else who seems to be having a
good day. Is
that also part of what you see
that is different?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON: Yes.

14:31.337 --> 14:34.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When Trump -- when a
vulnerability opens up
for Mr. Trump, and the news
cycle begins to

14:34.741 --> 14:40.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feature the vulnerability, he
effectively
changes the topic by attacking,
by doing something

14:40.880 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outrageous or eccentric, and
suddenly the
entire news agenda shifts. And
instead of

14:45.985 --> 14:50.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
focusing on the serious
potential exchange
and the vulnerability that has
initially been

14:50.389 --> 14:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exposed, we're galloping off in
some other
direction.

14:52.992 --> 14:56.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the electorate isn't
informed about the
substantive reason that there
might have been

14:56.963 --> 14:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concern about the original
statement.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is interesting,
because you
make that point on a day when we
have been

15:01.334 --> 15:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we're watching a lot of the
kind of coverage
of his statement about abortion.

15:04.837 --> 15:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has since put out a
statement, McKay
Coppins, saying that's not
exactly what he

15:09.208 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meant. Is that an example of
what Kathleen
is talking about?

15:12.011 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MCKAY COPPINS: Yes, I do think
that Trump
has a remarkable skill for
hijacking news

15:19.318 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cycles.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think that it's what
drives him more
than almost anything else. I
remember I spent

15:24.590 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some time with him in 2014, and
I ended up
on his plane, you know, the
massive 757 Trump

15:31.364 --> 15:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jet, and I remember watching
him. He had just
given a speech that morning in
New Hampshire.

15:35.101 --> 15:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember watching him spend
20, 30 minutes
changing the channel back from
MSNBC, to CNN,

15:41.174 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to FOX News, just searching
desperately for
some coverage of the speech.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember that the thing
that struck
me the whole time I spent with
him was how

15:50.483 --> 15:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much he cared about media
coverage, how much
he cared about attention. And in
a sense,

15:55.922 --> 16:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his entire presidential campaign
has been
one long media spectacle.

16:00.660 --> 16:05.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't know how much it
prepares him or shows
whether he's ready to be
president, but it

16:05.298 --> 16:10.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly shows his -- shows off
his skills
as a marketer, and he really
does have unparalleled

16:10.636 --> 16:12.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talent in that regard.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Stuart Stevens,
let's pivot
back to what you were saying a
moment ago

16:15.608 --> 16:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about what happens in the fall
campaign.

16:18.477 --> 16:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen polls in Wisconsin
today, a new
one, that shows that Donald
Trump is at 70

16:24.283 --> 16:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent unpopularity. We have
also seen national
polls which show him as
unpopular as well.

16:29.322 --> 16:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does that say, what does
that mean about
the GOP's chances in the fall?

16:33.226 --> 16:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART STEVENS: Well, I think
that we shouldn't
talk about Donald Trump as a
success. He's

16:37.830 --> 16:44.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running the worst campaign we
have ever seen
in modern history.

16:44.704 --> 16:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason he's able to hijack
news cycles
is that he doesn't care what he
says and he

16:49.575 --> 16:53.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
doesn't care about the
ramifications about
it. When you're willing to do
that, when you're

16:53.980 --> 16:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to sort of put on a
suicide vest and
pull the cord, you will get
attention, but

16:59.018 --> 17:00.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you will lose a general
election.

17:01.020 --> 17:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to get killed in the
general election,
absolutely slaughtered, and it
will be a disaster

17:05.091 --> 17:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Republican Party.

17:06.893 --> 17:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, the
Trump voters, we have seen, are
loyal, and

17:11.964 --> 17:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are steadfast, even if they
are presented
with evidence that what he is
saying is not

17:17.169 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
true. So, is that the brand that
we see at
work?

17:21.407 --> 17:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON: What we
see, I think,
is a candidate who very artfully
has capitalized

17:26.512 --> 17:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a large-scale sentiment in
the American
electorate that says that
government doesn't

17:30.616 --> 17:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appear to be working well,
politicians have
promised and not delivered.

17:33.986 --> 17:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here's someone who comes
outside the political
establishment, outside any
political background,

17:38.824 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and argues, I have a different
kind of competence,
a competence that will let us
win again -- that's

17:44.297 --> 17:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first part of his brand --
that is demonstrated
by what I have already done as a
businessman.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm highly successful.

17:50.169 --> 17:53.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second part of his brand, he has
all these
photo-ops in places that he's
built. And,

17:53.806 --> 17:56.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
third, I'm uncorrupt and
uncorruptable. I'm
financing myself.

17:56.709 --> 18:01.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, if you assume that
everybody else who
is seen by these voters in some
ways to them

18:01.847 --> 18:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics as usual, then the
Trump alternative
looks like change, even if at
times he's inconsistent,

18:07.954 --> 18:11.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
even if at times he says
outrageous things,
even if those voters don't
actually believe

18:11.891 --> 18:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will do some of the things he
says he will
do.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw that in Peter Hart's
focus group, Annenberg
Public Policy Center Voices of
the Voters.

18:18.531 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of his own voters said, no,
I don't actually
believe he's going to build a
wall or deport

18:22.301 --> 18:24.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all those people. I like him
anyway.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: McKay, I want to ask
you about
-- I know you're covering more
than just the

18:27.773 --> 18:29.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican side of this.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, does Donald Trump's ability
to dominate
the headlines, dominate the day,
does that

18:33.913 --> 18:38.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help or hurt the front-runner on
the Democratic
side? Does that hurt Bernie
Sanders? Does

18:38.818 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it help Hillary Clinton?

18:40.720 --> 18:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MCKAY COPPINS: Well, I think
Stuart is right
that the way that Trump has
managed to dominate

18:47.293 --> 18:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media is by saying outlandish,
provocative
things that have made him
actually, one poll

18:51.797 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently showed, the most
unpopular presidential
candidate since David Duke ran
for president.

18:57.870 --> 19:02.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So he is nationally very
unpopular. But I
do think that there is something
to be said

19:02.675 --> 19:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the fact that so much
attention and so
much coverage has been focused
on Donald Trump,

19:07.913 --> 19:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Republican side of the
race in general,
but on Trump in particular, that
it does have

19:12.785 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fascinating dynamic that has
played out
in the Democratic side, where
Hillary Clinton

19:17.923 --> 19:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually might face a lot of
tough scrutiny
in the general election that she
hasn't necessarily

19:23.929 --> 19:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faced on a wide scale in the
primary.

19:27.199 --> 19:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still, though, think that
Trump has done
so much damage to his own brand,
as you were

19:31.570 --> 19:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just talking about, with the
national electorate,
that it's going to be hard for
him to fix

19:36.509 --> 19:38.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that before November.

19:38.277 --> 19:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stu Stevens, why is
it that when
Mitt Romney came out, not once,
not twice,

19:42.715 --> 19:47.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe multiple times, and
criticized Donald
Trump, tough -- using tough
language, why

19:47.219 --> 19:48.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't that stick?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART STEVENS: Oh, I think it
has stuck.

19:50.723 --> 19:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did it in Ohio, and Trump
lost Ohio. He
did it in Utah and he lost in
Utah. And I

19:56.729 --> 20:02.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
think that there is good
indication here that
this is beginning to sink in
with Republican

20:02.068 --> 20:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters. The latest numbers
showed him 10 points
behind in Wisconsin to Ted Cruz,
who probably

20:08.607 --> 20:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not going to be accused of
being one of
the great natural politicians of
our day.

20:13.746 --> 20:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Republicans are probably
taking a
second look here. Look, on
average, the polls

20:18.784 --> 20:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show that Donald Trump is 17.5
points behind
Bernie Sanders. You have to
really think about

20:26.459 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. Very quickly, you're into
a discussion
not about holding the White
House, not about

20:30.930 --> 20:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
holding the Senate, but about
holding the
House.

20:34.133 --> 20:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has 50 FBI
agents looking
into her, according to The
Washington Post,

20:38.637 --> 20:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Donald Trump still is 10
points considered
less honest than Hillary
Clinton. That's hard

20:45.111 --> 20:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do. We don't have a lot of
Hispanic Republicans,
and 60 percent of the Hispanic
Republicans

20:51.851 --> 20:53.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
don't like Donald Trump.

20:53.619 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a toxic candidacy,
and I think
that before Republicans embark
on that, I

21:00.392 --> 21:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think they're beginning to take
a look at
what it would mean for the
party. You're seeing

21:03.796 --> 21:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of conservatives. Ben
Sasse, a deeply
conservative senator from
Nebraska, said that

21:11.270 --> 21:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will not support him and he
will look for
an alternative.

21:15.274 --> 21:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that there is
something happening
here, and I hope that
Republicans will go

21:20.045 --> 21:21.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a different direction.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you all very
much.

21:22.948 --> 21:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the record, "NewsHour" has
requested an
interview repeatedly with Mr.
Trump. And we

21:27.153 --> 21:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have yet to make that happen.
They have yet
to make that happen. We will
keep trying.

21:31.524 --> 21:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McKay Coppins, senior political
writer for
BuzzFeed, Kathleen Hall Jamieson
at the Annenberg

21:35.895 --> 21:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
School of Communications, and
Stu Stevens,
former Romney strategist, thank
you all very

21:40.633 --> 21:41.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

21:41.433 --> 21:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MCKAY COPPINS: Thank you.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHLEEN HALL JAMIESON: You're
welcome.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART STEVENS: Thank you.

21:51.844 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Since the start
of the Arab
uprisings five years ago, we
have seen a tectonic

21:57.750 --> 22:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shift across the Middle East and
North Africa,
upending the political order of
the last century.

22:04.123 --> 22:10.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What began with hope has
dissolved into civil
war, extremist violence and
strife. The human

22:10.529 --> 22:16.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toll has been enormous, with
hundreds of thousands
dead and millions more
displaced. And the

22:16.769 --> 22:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role the United States has
played and will
play in the Middle East is now
being examined

22:21.907 --> 22:23.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in depth.

22:23.876 --> 22:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One group looking at these
issues is the Middle
East Strategy Task Force at the
Atlantic Council,

22:28.681 --> 22:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a think tank here in Washington.

22:31.083 --> 22:36.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its co-chairs of the task force
join me now.
They are former Secretary of
State Madeleine

22:36.589 --> 22:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Albright, who served in the
Clinton administration,
and former National Security
Adviser Stephen

22:42.461 --> 22:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hadley. He served in the George
W. Bush administration.

22:46.465 --> 22:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the "NewsHour."

22:49.535 --> 22:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary Albright, let me start
with you.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Why take on this added
responsibility now
co-chairing this task force?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, Former U.S.
Secretary
of State: Well, it's great to be
with you

22:56.342 --> 22:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and with my friend Steve.

22:58.777 --> 23:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason that we did this is
because we're
concerned about the fact that
people are looking

23:03.749 --> 23:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Middle East kind of in
short-term ways
and doing Band-Aids that have
been going on,

23:09.788 --> 23:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that it was really important
to take a
deeper, longer look, because the
issues, as

23:14.560 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you raised them, are going to
take a long
time to resolve.

23:18.464 --> 23:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we needed to really take a
deeper look.
We also wanted it to be
bipartisan, and we

23:24.570 --> 23:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looked at a number of areas. One
was the security
issue, but governance issues,
issues to do

23:30.709 --> 23:37.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with religion, refugees,
education, the economy.
We had papers that we did with
that.

23:37.182 --> 23:42.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then we went to the
countries in order
to really get a view of what is
going on.

23:42.721 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We also have a lot of
international advisers,
but part of it, Judy, is -- and
the way that

23:47.059 --> 23:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you opened this, it is as
serious and terrible
as you described, but it also
has whole opportunities.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those are the things that we
wanted to
look at.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what I
want to ask
you about, because you have just
come back,

23:59.672 --> 24:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the secretary mentioned, from
a trip to
the region.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people look at this part of
the world
and they see a crisis in every
country, whether

24:06.478 --> 24:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's ISIS, or a repressive
leader or a refugee
influx crisis. How do you see
the region?

24:15.788 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you see it as a collection of
problems,
or a place that has a manageable
set of issues

24:24.363 --> 24:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you can get your arms
around?

24:25.964 --> 24:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY, Former U.S.
National Security
Adviser: Well, it's very tough.

24:27.766 --> 24:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it is a crisis in the
Middle East,
but it's also a crisis from the
Middle East.

24:32.838 --> 24:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I think people don't
realize is the
global consequences of this.
There are, of

24:38.177 --> 24:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course, economic crises, but we
have, of course,
refugee flows that are taxing
neighboring

24:43.048 --> 24:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states. They are a real problem
for the European
Union, putting enormous stress
on the European

24:47.619 --> 24:49.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Union.

24:49.321 --> 24:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is, of course, a terrorist
problem,
which is increased, as we saw,
with attacks

24:53.826 --> 24:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Brussels and Paris. So it is
a crisis in
the Middle East. It is a crisis
from the Middle

24:58.864 --> 25:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East. It's affecting the whole
country -- the
whole globe.

25:02.768 --> 25:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, as Madeleine
pointed out,
there are positive things going
on. One of

25:07.706 --> 25:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things we noticed is, youth
are playing
a role in their societies. They
are empowered,

25:13.312 --> 25:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are connected, they are
entrepreneurial.

25:16.648 --> 25:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you are seeing start-up
commercial ventures
starting. You are seeing
start-up bottom-up

25:22.388 --> 25:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community organizations that are
trying to
solve local community problems.
There's a

25:28.394 --> 25:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real bottom-up entrepreneurship
that is going.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we don't hear
about that
here.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: We don't hear
about them.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things we have
tried to do
is -- one of the things we want
to do is sort

25:36.502 --> 25:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of bring that to the attention.
There is an
opportunity for the refugees not
just to be

25:41.640 --> 25:46.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a burden, but with the kind of
training and
education, they can actually be
a benefit

25:46.912 --> 25:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the societies in which they
are now residing
and to rebuilding the societies
they can return

25:52.251 --> 25:53.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

25:54.019 --> 25:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are opportunities for
education, to
teach people problem-solving and
to counter

25:57.890 --> 25:59.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the violent extremists.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you -- is
it possible,
Secretary Albright, to
prioritize which country

26:03.629 --> 26:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is more important than the
other, or does
the United States have to
approach this as,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have got to look at the
entire region?

26:09.535 --> 26:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, we do.

26:11.370 --> 26:15.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we were taking about it
this way.
We have to look at the local
aspect of things,

26:15.040 --> 26:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because we need to respond to
some of the
changes that are taking place
inside, as Steve

26:19.945 --> 26:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentioned, but also regionally.
We do have
to look at it regionally and
globally.

26:24.516 --> 26:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the countries can help
each other,
and we did discus with them the
possibility

26:30.589 --> 26:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of kind of looking at some kind
of regional
security agreement, but, at the
same time,

26:34.760 --> 26:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have to recognize the
differences
in the countries.

26:39.031 --> 26:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tunisia, quite a different
place, for instance,
from Egypt in terms of how it's
beginning

26:44.403 --> 26:51.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to deal with its political
situation and its
economic situation, a good place
to invest.

26:51.043 --> 26:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Egypt has the problem of being
very large
with a huge unemployed young
population.

26:56.148 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have looked at the
specifics in the
countries, but also how they
could be dealt

27:01.520 --> 27:03.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with regionally.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But doesn't --
Stephen Hadley,
doesn't the security have to
come first, dealing

27:06.658 --> 27:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with ISIS, dealing with whether
it's a repressive
dictator who is -- a civil war,
as you have

27:14.933 --> 27:15.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria?

27:15.868 --> 27:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Absolutely.

27:17.903 --> 27:23.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the message is, there are
green shoots,
we call them, messages of hope
coming out

27:23.775 --> 27:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Middle East that need to
be nurtured.
And we need to nurturing them
now, because

27:28.947 --> 27:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the medium and long term,
they offer
the hope of a more prosperous
and secure Middle

27:33.952 --> 27:35.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
East.

27:35.754 --> 27:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the short run, they're
vulnerable to
the terrorists. They're
vulnerable to the

27:39.358 --> 27:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tyrants. And in the short run,
we have to
deal with exactly the problems
you described.

27:43.762 --> 27:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things we will do
is talk about
some of the things, that in the
short to medium

27:49.201 --> 27:51.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
term, we need to do.

27:51.169 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to work on all three
problems together,
countering ISIS, bringing down
the sectarianism,

27:56.775 --> 27:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and solving the civil wars.

27:58.577 --> 28:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think one
of the things,
Judy, is that everybody is
concerned with

28:02.648 --> 28:07.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ISIS, or Da'esh, but the
priorities are a
little bit different, because
they also have

28:07.719 --> 28:09.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
internal priorities.

28:09.154 --> 28:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They being?

28:10.155 --> 28:11.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: The
countries in the region.

28:11.957 --> 28:17.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, they have conflicts
between two
countries. For instance, the
Saudi-Iranian...

28:17.195 --> 28:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The historic...

28:19.097 --> 28:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: The historic
aspects,
or the Tunisians and Egyptians
are very worried

28:25.070 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about the Libyans.

28:26.872 --> 28:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is the general
aspect that dealing
with ISIS is a priority, but not
the only

28:31.944 --> 28:33.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing that they're thinking
about.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does the
United States
avoid, Steve Hadley, being
overwhelmed by

28:37.015 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, because, as Secretary
Albright just
said, every country has its own
set of issues?

28:41.954 --> 28:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. has to look at this, it
seems, and
make some sense of it and figure
out what

28:47.593 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should be tackled first.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Well, it is an
overwhelming
problem.

28:51.430 --> 28:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the first point that we want
to make in
this task force is that the
United States

28:56.635 --> 29:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is affected by this problem, as
is Europe
and a lot of other countries.
And it is in

29:01.239 --> 29:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States' interest to
try to help
the Middle East get to a more
stable and prosperous

29:06.078 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

29:08.013 --> 29:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we heard in the region a lot
of criticism.
Some people said the United
States historically

29:12.684 --> 29:16.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sometimes -- and the Bush
administration
did too much, and the Obama
administration

29:16.888 --> 29:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did too little. How come you
Americans can't
get it right?

29:20.092 --> 29:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things we're
trying to do is
come up to and approach the
Middle East that

29:25.964 --> 29:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protects our interests, that
contributes to
what the people in the Middle
East believe

29:31.570 --> 29:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is their future, but does it in
a way that
is sustainable over time?

29:37.409 --> 29:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, with the right
kinds of investments,
we can do that. But it is -- it
is -- we're

29:42.848 --> 29:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have to rethink it.
We're going to
have to build a bipartisan
consensus. And

29:46.718 --> 29:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then we're going to have to
sustain it, because
this problem is going to be a
long time in

29:50.889 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fixing.

29:52.658 --> 29:56.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it is not
easy to get it
right, is it, Secretary
Albright, in that,

29:56.194 --> 30:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we just heard, sometimes, the
U.S. is seen
as doing too much, getting too
involved. Other

30:01.133 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times, it's seen as not doing
nearly enough.

30:04.069 --> 30:07.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Well, I
think, because
it is so overwhelming and
complicated, we

30:07.939 --> 30:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to do a better job of
explaining why
this matters to us.

30:11.543 --> 30:17.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Steve said, it's not only
things that are
happening inside, but also the
pressures from

30:17.949 --> 30:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- globally, and to try to
explain why it's
important to Americans. And it's
important

30:23.555 --> 30:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to us, obviously, because the
president wants
to keep Americans safe, but also
because we're

30:30.696 --> 30:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerned about the humanitarian
aspects of
it, obviously, the resource
aspect, our relationship

30:36.268 --> 30:37.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Israel.

30:38.003 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have to explain that,
but I do think,
also, we need to understand that
we found

30:43.442 --> 30:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not easy to be the United
States there.
We were saying, damned if you
do, damned if

30:47.012 --> 30:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't. And we -- but I
believe, as so
does Steve, that we have to be
involved.

30:51.950 --> 30:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we are going to make a
point, I think,
of talking about what the
opportunities are,

30:57.189 --> 31:03.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as the problems, so that
the American
public understands why the
United States needs

31:03.261 --> 31:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be involved with partners.
And that is
what we also have to do, is make
clear that

31:08.800 --> 31:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the coalitions that are being
built need to
stay in place.

31:12.471 --> 31:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
continue to follow
the progress of the task force
and hope to

31:17.075 --> 31:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stay in touch with you as you
move forward.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Secretary
of State Madeleine
Albright and former National
Security Adviser

31:24.616 --> 31:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stephen Hadley, thank you.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHEN HADLEY: Nice to be with
you.

31:28.186 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Very good.
Thank you.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

31:41.867 --> 31:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
conservation
vs. development in California's
Desert Valley;

31:47.939 --> 31:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the story of Holocaust
survivors told
in photos of abandoned books.

31:52.778 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, the government of
Colombia is
in negotiations with Marxist
rebels, the Revolutionary

31:59.317 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, to end
50 years of war.

32:04.289 --> 32:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's infamous drug
trade, which fuels
the conflict and helps finance
the insurgency,

32:09.528 --> 32:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been a major point of debate
at the peace
talks. If a deal is signed, it
could prompt

32:14.499 --> 32:21.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
radical changes in the
production of illicit
crops, like coca, the raw
material for cocaine.

32:21.273 --> 32:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondents Bruno
Federico and
Nadja Drost traveled to the
heart of the coca

32:26.111 --> 32:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade in the southern region of
Putumayo to
find out what impact a peace
deal would have.

32:32.184 --> 32:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The report is narrated by Ms.
Drost.

32:35.353 --> 32:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It's high noon, and
the sun scorching,
as pickers grab at the leaves of
coca plants.

32:41.459 --> 32:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): For us
owners of
the crop and workers who puck
it, it's a big

32:46.298 --> 32:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process to harvest it, to get
the powder.

32:48.567 --> 32:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Long before white
powder cocaine
hits the streets of the U.S. and
Europe, it

32:54.506 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starts in a field like this, in
an isolated
patch of the Putumayo region in
Colombia's

33:00.011 --> 33:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
south, where coca leaves are
harvested and
then processes into a coca base,
the foundation

33:06.184 --> 33:07.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of cocaine.

33:08.019 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Two
acres produces
5,000 or 6,000 grams of coca
base and each

33:13.191 --> 33:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gram is cheap, sold for about 50
cents.

33:16.695 --> 33:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: These pickers are
at the bottom
of the rung of Colombia's
multimillion-dollar

33:21.900 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cocaine industry. But in
providing the material
for cocaine, they risk arrest on
drug-related

33:27.539 --> 33:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges and don't want their
faces to appear
on camera.

33:31.710 --> 33:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): This
is illegal,
you know. If the government
comes and sees

33:38.216 --> 33:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the laboratory, they will burn
it. And if
they see the guys working here,
they will

33:41.519 --> 33:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take them away. It's a real
problem.

33:43.521 --> 33:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Even so, these
workers face the
risks of the job because they
have few other

33:48.927 --> 33:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
options. If they were to grow
food crops,
they say, they would have to
travel great

33:53.431 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
distances to market for
rock-bottom prices
and little profit. Coca provides
them a way

33:58.870 --> 34:00.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make a living.

34:00.705 --> 34:05.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Legal
work doesn't
pay much, but this pays well,
you know? These

34:05.377 --> 34:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guys can make $25, $30 a day,
but, elsewhere,
a day laborer is worth $6 a day.

34:11.316 --> 34:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: That's why, here in
Putumayo,
ground zero of the coca trade,
coca is the

34:17.188 --> 34:19.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
main livelihood for locals.

34:19.124 --> 34:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that could drastically
change should a
peace deal be signed between the
FARC and

34:23.828 --> 34:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government. Negotiators
debating how to
address Colombia's infamous drug
trade have

34:28.867 --> 34:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreed to put an end to illicit
crops.

34:33.538 --> 34:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombia's drug trade generates
the FARC an
estimated $200 million a year,
according to

34:39.077 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
InSight Crime, a group that
tracks the illicit
drug trade. The rebels are
considered narco-traffickers.

34:43.481 --> 34:50.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Joaquin Gomez, the top
commander of the
southern bloc says that's an
unfair characterization.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the FARC's southern
bloc, says that
is an unfair characterization.
He says the

34:52.057 --> 34:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARC doesn't exist because of
the drug trade;
they draw on it by taxing it to
finance their

34:57.329 --> 34:59.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cause.

34:59.197 --> 35:04.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAQUIN GOMEZ, FARC (through
translator):
There's been one relationship or
another indirectly

35:04.569 --> 35:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with narco-trafficking, but
that's why there
are crimes are related to
rebellion, because

35:08.306 --> 35:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been to get the funds or
means to keep
confronting the enemy of class.

35:12.477 --> 35:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The U.S. State
Department claims
Gomez has overseen the
production of thousands

35:18.183 --> 35:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of tons of cocaine and offers a
reward of
$2.5 million for his capture.

35:23.388 --> 35:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as part of the peace deal,
Colombia's
President Juan Manuel Santos
visited the U.S.

35:28.827 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in February and asked Washington
to drop drug-related
charges against FARC leaders.
Since 2000,

35:36.935 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. has spent over $9
billion on Plan
Colombia, fighting the narcotics
field insurgency,

35:43.608 --> 35:48.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the effort, aerial
fumigations to
eradicate the coca plant. Crops
dropped by

35:48.847 --> 35:51.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over half by 2014.

35:51.049 --> 35:58.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But production is back on the
rise, and Colombia
has overtaken Peru as the
world's top producer.

35:58.256 --> 36:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aerial spraying has also killed
food crops
and been blamed for serious
health problems.

36:03.328 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, as a part of the expected
peace accords,
both the government and the FARC
have committed

36:08.566 --> 36:14.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to supporting farmers to
substitute their
coca crops for legal ones, but
locals worry.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICARDO, Colombia (through
translator): What's
the fear? That if coca ends,
there will be

36:18.610 --> 36:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of people without jobs.

36:20.879 --> 36:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: And coca base is so
important
to this town, it's even used to
buy goods,

36:26.818 --> 36:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a valid currency here. The only
way locals
can imagine coca substitution
programs working

36:33.758 --> 36:38.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is if the governments invests in
ways to make
alternative crops viable, so
that communities

36:38.630 --> 36:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't have to relay on coca.

36:41.132 --> 36:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICARDO (through translator): We
hope that,
instead of gunshots, there is
social investment.

36:45.303 --> 36:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will leave coca to the side
and invest
in cattle-raising or something.

36:48.807 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Coca leaves,
ammonium, cement,
sodium hydroxide and gasoline,
rudimentary

36:56.081 --> 36:58.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
labs like this keep churning out
coca base.

36:58.883 --> 37:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): If
there's peace,
we won't count on coca. If the
government

37:04.689 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't come through, well, we
will have to
keep going with coca.

37:07.926 --> 37:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: If a peace deal
doesn't provide
alternatives to coca, there will
be no shortage

37:12.931 --> 37:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of campesinos willing to fill
demand for drugs
abroad, far away from these coca
fields.

37:20.705 --> 37:26.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
reporting with Bruno
Federico, I'm Nadja Drost in
Putumayo, Colombia.

37:26.711 --> 37:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Colombian
government announced
today that it would soon begin
peace talks

37:31.783 --> 37:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the country's second
largest rebel group,
the National Liberation Army, or
ELN. Colombia's

37:37.889 --> 37:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
half-century of violence has
killed nearly
a quarter-million people.

37:45.230 --> 37:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: striking a
balance between
development and conservation to
protect the

37:59.310 --> 38:03.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
desert ecosystem of the
Coachella Valley in
California.

38:03.681 --> 38:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
has the story.

38:06.718 --> 38:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The views from Chino
Canyon high
above Palm Springs are grand.
The rocky hillsides

38:14.626 --> 38:20.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are home to the endangered
Peninsular bighorn
sheep and a number of other
species. But this

38:20.431 --> 38:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tranquil canyon has long been an
environmental
battleground.

38:24.235 --> 38:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICKIE MCLAUGHLIN, Activist: If
the project
had been completed, you would
have been looking

38:28.506 --> 38:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a 500-room hotel, a five-star
resort, and
all surrounded by an 18-hole
golf course.

38:35.280 --> 38:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Nickie McLaughlin
heads up a local
nonprofit that recently
purchased 600 acres

38:40.919 --> 38:44.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of privately owned land in the
canyon to prevent
that development.

38:44.989 --> 38:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICKIE MCLAUGHLIN: There will be
nothing here.
It will be preserved as it is in
perpetuity.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was a huge success.

38:51.462 --> 38:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The push to save Chino
Canyon is
part of a much larger
environmental conservation

38:56.334 --> 39:02.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort unfolding in Coachella
Valley, a 45-mile
stretch of desert dotted with
upscale cities

39:02.874 --> 39:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Palm Springs, as well as
areas of deep
poverty.

39:07.145 --> 39:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The population here is expected
to almost
double in the next 20 years.
Golf courses

39:12.450 --> 39:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and condos butt up against
fragile desert
ecosystems.

39:15.486 --> 39:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KIRK, Coachella Valley
Association of
Governments: In a lot of places
throughout

39:18.356 --> 39:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country, we know that we
have done development
perhaps in a rash and vast way.
In the Coachella

39:26.164 --> 39:27.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Valley, we didn't want to do
that.

39:27.966 --> 39:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Tom Kirk heads up the
local government
agency now managing a plan that
took more

39:32.470 --> 39:39.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 10 years to develop and
that will be
on the books 75 years into the
future.

39:39.210 --> 39:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's called the Coachella Valley
Multiple
Species Habitat Conservation
Plan. Nearly

39:45.049 --> 39:51.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
2,000-pages long, it is
essentially a huge
compromise between government
agencies, private

39:51.089 --> 39:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
landowners and developers,
scientists, and
environmental groups.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did you bring everyone
together?

39:57.328 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KIRK: They were brought
together perhaps
not by choice, but by need.
Before there was

40:03.001 --> 40:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a plan, every project was
evaluated on its
own. It would take a lot of
time. There'd

40:07.972 --> 40:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a lot of uncertainty. Today,
instead of
dealing with every project
individually, we

40:14.579 --> 40:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at a million acres at the
same time.

40:17.148 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Kirk, who brought us
to a now preserved
area called Whitewater Canyon
that had been

40:23.021 --> 40:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slated to be an ATV park, showed
me how the
habitat plan works.

40:27.492 --> 40:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KIRK: You can actually
develop anywhere
in the plan, but it is very
difficult to do

40:32.363 --> 40:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so in conservation areas, and
very easy to
do so, relatively, on the valley
floor.

40:37.635 --> 40:43.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Out of the million or
so acres in
the valley, 700,000 have been
designated as

40:43.241 --> 40:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservation areas, where the
land is kept
mostly pristine. Outside of the
conservation

40:49.447 --> 40:55.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, development can go
forward in a timely
manner because the necessary
endangered species

40:55.353 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
permits have already been
secured.

40:58.122 --> 41:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plan is designed to ensure
the survival
of 27 endangered and threatened
species, large

41:04.295 --> 41:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and small animals, rare plants,
and one little
desert dweller well known in
these parts,

41:10.401 --> 41:12.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the fringe-toed lizard.

41:12.236 --> 41:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAMERON BARROWS, Ecologist:
Here's a little
baby fringe-toed lizard, just
hatched probably

41:17.975 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this past fall.

41:19.944 --> 41:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: I met up with one of
the few people
who has a special permit to
catch this endangered

41:23.848 --> 41:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
species, Cameron Barrows. He's
an ecologist
who is monitoring with a team of
scientists

41:29.620 --> 41:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how the protected species are
faring under
the plan.

41:32.623 --> 41:36.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAMERON BARROWS: Even though we
have a finite
number of species that we're
trying to protect

41:36.194 --> 41:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, we're really trying to
protect the entire
ecosystem. We're measuring
everything. We

41:41.065 --> 41:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to make sure that this is
an intact system.
We don't want to be able to say
in 75 years,

41:46.337 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, we forgot about that
mouse, and
it went extinct. Oh, well.

41:50.608 --> 41:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Barrows was on the
scientific advisory
committee that provided guidance
about which

41:55.913 --> 42:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas of the valley need to be
protected,
an effort he says that charted
new ground

42:00.985 --> 42:02.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in conservation science.

42:02.687 --> 42:07.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAMERON BARROWS: We're striking
this balance
between habitat and development.
And this

42:07.692 --> 42:12.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was one of the first places in
the nation
that tried to really strike an
effective balance.

42:12.230 --> 42:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to do that, we had to apply
the best
science we possibly could.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nature is complex. It's really
complex. And
to be able to say this patch is
enough or

42:21.572 --> 42:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this level of connection is
enough is really
challenging to do that.

42:27.245 --> 42:33.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: This underpass behind
me plays an
important role in the habitat
plan. It allows

42:33.684 --> 42:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
animals on this side of busy
Interstate 10
to move safely to the other
side. It is one

42:39.123 --> 42:46.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of a number of so-called
wildlife corridors
that are scattered throughout
the valley.

42:46.264 --> 42:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But ensuring the protected areas
are connected
in perpetuity has been an
ongoing effort.

42:52.236 --> 42:58.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 25 percent of the land was
privately
owned when the plan went into
effect in 2008.

42:58.709 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Landowners are not forced to
sell, but if
they do, they are compensated at
market rates,

43:04.382 --> 43:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or they can pursue minimal
development approved
by the plan. So far, tens of
millions of dollars

43:10.221 --> 43:16.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been spent to secure about
90,000 acres,
or a third of the designated
conservation

43:16.194 --> 43:17.995 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

43:18.029 --> 43:23.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still, many landowners,
developers, and even
some cities in the valley
initially opposed

43:23.901 --> 43:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the plan due to the limits on
development.

43:26.537 --> 43:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN GUTIERREZ, CEO, Desert
Valley Builders
Association: There was some
struggles. Nothing

43:29.140 --> 43:32.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is ever easy when you take on a
project of
this size.

43:32.143 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Gretchen Gutierrez is
CEO of the
Desert Valley Builders
Association.

43:36.681 --> 43:39.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN GUTIERREZ: Right now,
what you're
seeing is the first phase, which
is models.

43:39.984 --> 43:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's going to be 166
single-family
houses, single and two stories,
in this development.

43:45.156 --> 43:50.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The permitting process
here went
fairly quickly and no lawsuits
were filed.

43:50.228 --> 43:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why Gutierrez says
developers eventually
got on board.

43:53.564 --> 43:57.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN GUTIERREZ: What it's
provided for
our members is the surety that
they can move

43:57.602 --> 44:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their projects forward. I don't
think anyone
wants to see the plastification
of any of

44:03.007 --> 44:06.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the communities out here, or the
paving over
of the world with concrete.

44:06.444 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same point in time,
you need to
have continued growth in terms
of new residences,

44:11.682 --> 44:15.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of new businesses, so
that it all
gives you a good quality of
life.

44:15.686 --> 44:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Developers now pay a
fee for each
property they build, and that
money goes towards

44:20.491 --> 44:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
purchasing more land in the
conservation areas.
Additional funds come from a
variety of sources,

44:26.531 --> 44:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including government grants.

44:28.966 --> 44:33.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While many in the valley agree
the plan is
working, whether it can hold up
over the long

44:33.638 --> 44:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run is up for debate. Recently,
plans for
a new housing development within
this conservation

44:39.710 --> 44:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area were submitted to the
county for consideration.
The project called Paradise
Valley would back

44:45.716 --> 44:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to Joshua Tree National Park
on one side,
and the area is considered
critical habitat

44:51.022 --> 44:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the threatened desert
tortoise.

44:53.591 --> 44:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The development highlights one
of the gray
areas of the plan: In the large
conservation

44:58.429 --> 45:04.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, up to 10 percent of the
land can be
developed. The developer,
Glorious Land Company

45:04.569 --> 45:10.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Enterprises, declined to speak
with us on
camera, but provided a written
statement.

45:10.041 --> 45:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It reads in part that the
development will
incorporate new urbanism and
smart growth

45:15.479 --> 45:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concepts, and that planners and
environmental
consultants for the project are
in consultation

45:20.318 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with regulatory agencies.

45:22.954 --> 45:27.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cameron Barrows is one of a
number of scientists
and local environmental groups
opposed to

45:27.692 --> 45:29.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the development.

45:29.527 --> 45:33.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAMERON BARROWS: Without any
question, the
tortoise population will decline
if that happens.

45:33.431 --> 45:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's incumbent on all of us, the
scientists,
as well as everybody else that's
involved

45:37.301 --> 45:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this plan, to sit down with
these folks
on a regular basis and say,
remember why we're

45:41.405 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing this. Remember why you got
to do this
development or that development,
because the

45:46.811 --> 45:48.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plan is here.

45:48.713 --> 45:53.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: The proposed
development still faces
extensive review before any
ground is broken,

45:53.084 --> 45:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but many here will be watching
closely for
how things play out as
conservation efforts

45:58.689 --> 46:00.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continue.

46:00.157 --> 46:04.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Coachella
Valley, California.

46:04.161 --> 46:09.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Coachella
Valley's plan was
among the first of its kind when
it was developed,

46:10.001 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, in recent years, the
strategy has been
catching on. There are now more
than 1,000

46:15.473 --> 46:19.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans that seek to protect
single and multiple
species.

46:19.377 --> 46:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Efforts in the valley got a
boost when President
Obama named three national
monuments in Southern

46:24.749 --> 46:32.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California, and one of them
overlaps with
the conservation plan.

46:32.890 --> 46:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight:
Imagine finding
a library from the 1940s, a
window into the

46:46.737 --> 46:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time before the deportation of
some 70,000
Jews from what was then
Czechoslovakia.

46:53.310 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown reports on a
photographer who
learned something about himself
in the decades-old

46:57.982 --> 46:59.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bookshelves.

46:59.750 --> 47:04.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At first glance,
you might
wonder: What is this? What am I
looking at?

47:04.889 --> 47:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then it hits you: These are
books, fragments
of books, in various states of
decay.

47:10.961 --> 47:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were photographed where
they'd been left,
an abandoned schoolhouse in the
town of Bardejov,

47:16.567 --> 47:18.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Slovakia.

47:18.402 --> 47:24.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yuri Dojc, a successful art and
commercial
photographer who's lived in
Canada since 1968,

47:24.642 --> 47:29.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
returned to his native country
after his father's
death, to learn more about his
own Jewish

47:29.280 --> 47:31.282 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
roots.

47:31.315 --> 47:36.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He came upon the schoolhouse
almost by accident,
when a man he'd met told Dojc
there was something

47:36.654 --> 47:38.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he must see.

47:38.489 --> 47:42.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YURI DOJC, Commercial
Photographer: And then
he take us across the square. He
opened this

47:42.059 --> 47:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
door. And we were just stunned.

47:45.930 --> 47:48.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You had no idea
what you were
walking into?

47:48.299 --> 47:52.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YURI DOJC: I had no clue. But I
was stunned
by the beauty of decaying books.
I wasn't

47:52.603 --> 47:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking about history at that
moment. It's
the visual effect of these old
books was so

47:58.342 --> 48:00.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beautiful.

48:00.144 --> 48:03.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Beautiful, but
horrible at
the same time, as the sense of
history set

48:03.881 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, for this was a Jewish
schoolhouse, left
as it had been in 1942, as Jews
were being

48:09.820 --> 48:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rounded up and taken by train to
the concentration
camp at Auschwitz.

48:16.460 --> 48:24.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The story is told in a
documentary Dojc worked
on with another emigre from the
former Czechoslovakia,

48:24.869 --> 48:26.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Katya Krausova.

48:26.737 --> 48:33.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two began by seeking out and
listening
to the stories of Holocaust
survivors.

48:33.511 --> 48:39.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you went to meet these
people, essentially,
right? And one led to another.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATYA KRAUSOVA, Director, "Last
Folio": Yes,
exactly.

48:41.318 --> 48:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here is a mixture and a
selection of some
that, by the time I joined him,
were dead,

48:47.758 --> 48:50.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others that we had found
together, like
this couple.

48:50.594 --> 48:52.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Tell me
about them.

48:52.363 --> 48:57.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATYA KRAUSOVA: They're very
important to
the whole story, because we
heard about them

48:57.268 --> 49:03.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in another town. And she didn't
want to even
let us come to the house.

49:03.340 --> 49:05.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, eventually I said, "Can we
just come
and have tea?"

49:05.743 --> 49:12.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once we were there, she
said: "I might
as well tell you my story. Maybe
nobody will

49:12.283 --> 49:14.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ever come again to ask."

49:14.251 --> 49:20.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she told us her story, a
very strong
woman who talked about how they
were betrayed

49:20.191 --> 49:25.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how, when they were taken to
the camps,
they actually believed that they
were going

49:25.663 --> 49:27.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to work.

49:27.498 --> 49:32.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said that: "None of us
realized once
we got out of the truck that we
would never

49:32.136 --> 49:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be able to say goodbye to
anybody again."

49:34.705 --> 49:40.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Almost all of
these people
are now gone. In "Last Folio,"
the two try

49:40.811 --> 49:43.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to capture what remains.

49:43.414 --> 49:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So these are books literally
sitting on the
shelves as you walked in?

49:46.217 --> 49:48.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YURI DOJC: Yes, but I focus on
this particular
group.

49:48.352 --> 49:50.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

49:50.154 --> 49:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YURI DOJC: There is something
like a rhythm
here. There's colors, a chance
this color

49:54.792 --> 49:59.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to this color to this. So
there's a beautiful
-- look at this. The shades of
color, they

49:59.597 --> 50:01.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are just stunning.

50:01.332 --> 50:06.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: First an
aesthetic experience,
and then more, the books
standing in for,

50:06.103 --> 50:09.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost becoming, the lives of
the people who'd
held them in their hands.

50:09.874 --> 50:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YURI DOJC: I changed as a
photographer on
this project.

50:13.077 --> 50:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I only started understanding
what it's all
about. Until then, I was just --
I had fun.

50:19.950 --> 50:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand certain aesthetics.
But I was
missing something. And I
realized that you

50:25.856 --> 50:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't take art pictures with
your eyes. You
take them with your brains, and
I didn't know

50:28.926 --> 50:30.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

50:30.327 --> 50:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What does that
mean, to take
it with your brain?

50:32.496 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YURI DOJC: You try to express
something which
was -- which is more than just
what I see.

50:39.236 --> 50:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a process of showing you
what happened
to those people. Like, I'm
projecting really

50:45.876 --> 50:50.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people and this whole pain and
all that is
lost into the pictures.

50:50.214 --> 50:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And there was one
more shock
for Dojc and Krausova when they
visited another

50:55.686 --> 51:00.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
abandoned building that
contained books from
all over Eastern Europe,
including, incredibly,

51:00.357 --> 51:04.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one that had belonged to Dojc's
grandfather,
who died at Auschwitz.

51:04.762 --> 51:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YURI DOJC: That was a miracle,
just pure,
pure miracle. And then I was
thinking if this

51:12.102 --> 51:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whole journey's not a miracle.

51:13.837 --> 51:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATYA KRAUSOVA: So, nothing new
under the
sun, but very important to be
outraged.

51:17.841 --> 51:22.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Katya
Krausova, there's
more: important echoes to the
destruction

51:22.446 --> 51:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people and culture still
going on today.

51:25.182 --> 51:31.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATYA KRAUSOVA: You know, what
is happening
right now in the Middle East is
very tragic,

51:31.789 --> 51:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because libraries are being
burned, and monuments
are being destroyed.

51:37.027 --> 51:44.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is our heritage, and we
need to somehow
do everything to preserve it.
So, when I say

51:44.535 --> 51:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
privileged to have worked on
this, it was
a privilege to learn people's
lives and their

51:50.574 --> 51:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories. And I think we need to
go on telling
it to each other and to others.

51:56.313 --> 52:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Washington,
D.C., I'm
Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

52:00.784 --> 52:14.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: A college
education can be a ticket out of
poverty for

52:14.999 --> 52:20.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of Americans. But new
research shows
that those who grew up poor may
get less of

52:20.838 --> 52:26.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a payoff for a college degree
than those who
didn't. What's behind this
disparity?

52:26.276 --> 52:30.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Making Sense columnist Denise
Cummins writes
that, for many, success after
college is all

about who you know. Read her

thank you, and good night.

52:52.136 --> 52:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
