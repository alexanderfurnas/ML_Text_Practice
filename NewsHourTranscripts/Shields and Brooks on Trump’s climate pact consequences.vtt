JUDY WOODRUFF: At the end of
another week jam-packed with
news from Washington, it's

00:04.000 --> 00:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time for Shields and Brooks.

00:06.033 --> 00:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

00:10.233 --> 00:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentleman.

00:12.333 --> 00:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is there to talk about,
Mark, but yesterday's climate
change decision, the president's

00:19.000 --> 00:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
announcement that the United
States will pull out of
the Paris climate accord?

00:23.533 --> 00:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you make of it?

00:25.566 --> 00:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: In immediate
impact, Judy, it probably means
less in the American environment

00:32.566 --> 00:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the rules and
regulations already repealed
by his administration
and by his EPA that

00:40.066 --> 00:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were put in force, emissions
controlled by President Obama.

00:44.400 --> 00:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, in a larger sense,
it belies and reveals
that president's
sense about the world.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The world is a dangerous,
sinister place.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's conspiracies.

00:56.366 --> 01:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other countries are not
our friends, are partners.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything is transactional.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are no fixed values.

01:03.833 --> 01:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw that, I thought most
dramatically, at NATO, where
the president showed an absolute

01:10.333 --> 01:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absence of any historical
understanding of
American exceptionalism.

01:14.033 --> 01:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as one who frankly
subscribes to it that
three times in the
20th century the United

01:20.966 --> 01:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States saved the world from
totalitarianism, twice in World
Wars, once in the Cold War,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 124,965 American graves
around the world in cemeteries,
and 94,000 still missing.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just don't understand.

01:34.866 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president knows
that it was for values.

01:37.533 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when NATO has made
mistakes, we have made mistakes.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have been guilty of hubris.

01:42.466 --> 01:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the world is a much
better place because of the
United States' leadership.

01:46.833 --> 01:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was an example of
the United States working with
other nations for a common good

01:53.000 --> 01:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to preserve our planet.

01:54.466 --> 01:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he just turned
his back on it.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you make
of the president's decision and
his argument for why he did it?

01:59.233 --> 02:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well,
I sort of agree with Mark.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was nice to have
an American century.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were a superpower once.

02:03.266 --> 02:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And now we're headed
the way of Portugal.

02:05.233 --> 02:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, it was --
environmentally, I can't
get super excited about it.

02:09.966 --> 02:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it was a
setback for the cause of
addressing global warming.

02:13.766 --> 02:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, as we have heard
many times, it was a
voluntary agreement.

02:18.166 --> 02:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this -- and we have done
a very good job, because of
natural gas and fracking and

02:21.933 --> 02:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other things, of reducing
emissions over the
last five years or so.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I presume the market
will still work and the
emissions will still come down.

02:29.333 --> 02:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we -- Donald Trump could
have addressed his concerns
about coal workers and stayed

02:33.666 --> 02:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Paris accords.

02:34.666 --> 02:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is nothing block.

02:35.666 --> 02:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was totally voluntary.

02:37.433 --> 02:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this wasn't about
global warming.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This wasn't about
the environment.

02:41.066 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was about sticking a thumb
in the eye of polite society,
the elites, the globalists.

02:47.900 --> 02:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a Steve Bannon-led
thing designed to change
America's role in the world.

02:51.866 --> 02:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, to me, the
effect is much worse
on the global diplomacy
and the idea of a world

02:58.466 --> 03:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
order than it is, at
least in the short-term,
about climate change.

03:00.766 --> 03:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the effects, I
think, are ruinous.

03:03.333 --> 03:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can't lead the world
and stick your thumb in
the eye of the world.

03:07.233 --> 03:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People -- if you act extremely
selfishly to other people, they
will start acting extremely

03:11.000 --> 03:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
selfishly to you.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is about to happen.

03:14.700 --> 03:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so as the idea that America
could lead the world and
should influence the world and

03:19.333 --> 03:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should have friendship with
other powerful nations in the
world, that's an idea that

03:23.600 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
took a big hit this week.

03:25.766 --> 03:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as
we famously heard him
say, yesterday, Mark,
the president said,

03:29.166 --> 03:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm here to represent the
people of Pittsburgh, and
not the people of Paris.

03:32.433 --> 03:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, no, it
was a nice alliterative
line that didn't have
much relevance in reality,

03:39.300 --> 03:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pittsburgh having supported
Hillary Clinton and
basically being a green city.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it was a
political statement.

03:50.300 --> 03:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One can say, in defense
of the president, I
guess, he kept his word.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He hasn't been known as
a truth-teller always.

03:58.566 --> 04:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one has confused him with
George Washington on veracity.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But he kept his word
on the Trans-Pacific
treaty, trade treaty.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He kept his word on NATO and
that he was going to belittle
it, or at least diminish it.

04:13.466 --> 04:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he kept his word here.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that was probably
the strongest argument inside.

04:18.366 --> 04:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I'm just struck by the fact
that his is an administration
driven solely by resentment.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will side with the Steve
Bannon side if that position
will alienate the people he

04:29.100 --> 04:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feels resentful for.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He will side with the
regular Republican side
and the budgetary, the
more free market side

04:36.500 --> 04:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if that will offend
elite opinion.

04:38.633 --> 04:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems to be all based on
some sense of resentment, a
sense of social inferiority,

04:42.666 --> 04:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sense of fragile ego, him
just wanting to stick the eye
in the people he is resenting.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I -- more than any other
time -- we have talked about
Trump not telling the truth a

04:51.966 --> 04:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot over the last year.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that global warming speech
to me set new standards of
just being irrelevant to the

04:59.566 --> 05:01.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
facts.

05:01.066 --> 05:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We devote our lives to
talking about the evidence.

05:03.033 --> 05:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We write these wonky
columns about exciting
things and this and that.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what Donald Trump said about
the Paris accord is -- just
has no engagement with reality.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that somehow we're
bound by this, somehow that
we would be under some sort of

05:15.900 --> 05:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legal liability if we didn't
abide by the Paris accords,
the fact that the Chinese are

05:22.833 --> 05:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given permission by Paris to
do this and we're not, all that
has no contact reality, and

05:27.066 --> 05:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it doesn't seem like
Donald Trump knows that.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He doesn't.

05:30.066 --> 05:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: As a number
of commentators made, it
doesn't seem like lying.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just seems like willful
ignorance and disinterest.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have had a lot
of presidents with a
lot of disagreements,
but there has been an

05:38.566 --> 05:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attachment to some sort of
basic research, some basic
contact with reality, which it

05:45.400 --> 05:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems there has just
been a failure of
intellectual virtue here.

05:48.033 --> 05:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because there is some
underlying psychological
issues which is he is
working out, and whatever

05:51.900 --> 05:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he needs to do that, the facts
have to fit that lower reality.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

05:57.433 --> 06:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just add to that, Judy,
what compounds it is not --
if you are on the other side

06:03.500 --> 06:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the argument, you are not
wrong, you are not mistaken,
your facts aren't incorrect.

06:06.333 --> 06:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You are evil, you are
part of a conspiracy.

06:10.733 --> 06:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whatever one thinks, we
are all, all of us, all human
beings, are passengers on this

06:18.933 --> 06:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little spaceship of
ours with very precious
supplies, vulnerable
supplies of air and water

06:27.033 --> 06:29.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and soil.

06:29.566 --> 06:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, any attempt
to make it rational, to
make it just, to help
human -- make people

06:36.166 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more safe and secure and
healthy is to be commended.

06:40.333 --> 06:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's all of a sudden
really did regard this as
selling out the United States.

06:47.266 --> 06:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to cede to China the
leadership in the green
industry, is an abdication.

06:56.033 --> 07:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He accused Barack Obama,
and so did many Republicans,
of leading from the rear.

07:02.500 --> 07:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is retweeting to the
rear at every possible level.

07:08.133 --> 07:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just cannot overstate
the NATO -- NATO brought a
sustained period of peace, more

07:13.633 --> 07:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sustained than any time
since the French Revolution,
to the continent of Europe.

07:17.833 --> 07:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that is an achievement
of such historical magnitude.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And to just dismiss it.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is not even aware of it.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think he understands it.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From a purely
political standpoint, David, the
president, one assumes he think

07:31.766 --> 07:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is a smart thing to do.

07:33.233 --> 07:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, is it a smart
thing for him to do?

07:35.766 --> 07:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think so.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, I do think so.

07:39.533 --> 07:43.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Environment has never
driven political
voters, I do not think.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't remember a time
when environmental issues
really rose to that level.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And any time you can pit the
economy vs. the environment,
say I'm siding with the economy,

07:53.633 --> 07:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politically -- again, not on
the merits, not what I think
of it -- I think it is probably

07:56.200 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a winning issue.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, finally, just remember,
this is an administration
who is polling and whose
interest is focused

08:02.933 --> 08:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on about 12 states.

08:05.966 --> 08:08.000 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's a lot
of coal country.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if people in that
part of the world, with some
justice, some minor justice, see

08:15.300 --> 08:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump as their
savior against the
elites in Paris, then,
politically -- taking aside

08:18.166 --> 08:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the merits, politically,
I think it is probably
a good move for him.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you agree
it's winning politically?

08:22.833 --> 08:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I thought
Governor Jerry Brown made a
case last night in his interview

08:25.933 --> 08:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with you, pointed out
that California has
the toughest, greenest
standards of the country,

08:32.833 --> 08:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far more draconian by Trump's
standard, measure, than
anything, environmentally.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two million new jobs, a gross
domestic product grown 40
percent fastest than the nation,

08:46.133 --> 08:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in spite of, because
of the greenness.

08:50.500 --> 08:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think a case can be made.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.400 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But I just think
-- I don't know.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think there is a limit
to the isolation and this sort
of -- this defensive paranoid,

09:02.466 --> 09:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whatever you call
it, nationalism.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It isn't even nationalism.

09:06.833 --> 09:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is just sort of everybody,
all strangers, they are all
-- you know, they are all bad.

09:12.266 --> 09:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They wish us no well.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An us vs. them.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: On every matter.

09:16.966 --> 09:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, but do you
notice how what used to be
substantive disagreements turn

09:20.733 --> 09:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into cultural wars?

09:21.933 --> 09:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like the gun issue.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It used to be the gun issue,
gun control was about which kind
of guns we should have floating

09:27.433 --> 09:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around in our society.

09:28.666 --> 09:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then it became
rural vs. urban.

09:31.366 --> 09:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the substance didn't
actually matter that much.

09:33.966 --> 09:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one has the sense with
global warming it's a not
about substance anymore.

09:38.433 --> 09:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is about what culture
-- in our cultural divide,
which culture are you on?

09:42.466 --> 09:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he aligned with
one culture, a rural
culture, which is his base.

09:45.966 --> 09:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is why I think, from
his point of view, it solidifies
that, which he needs to

09:50.433 --> 09:52.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
survive.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it seems
like a long time ago, but it
was just -- really just really

09:54.566 --> 09:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a couple of days ago, Mark, that
we were hearing reports about
the White House in disarray,

10:00.900 --> 10:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president planning to fire
or rearrange - - fire people,
rearrange the staff in an

10:06.833 --> 10:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempt to get beyond
the focus on the Russia
investigation, everything else.

10:11.500 --> 10:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You couple that with the Paris
announcement, do you see this
White House in any sense getting

10:18.700 --> 10:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beyond, getting its hands
around the dysfunction that
appears to be gripping...

10:25.866 --> 10:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I really don't.

10:27.733 --> 10:30.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I really don't, Judy.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, just imagine
yourself, you are Reince
Priebus, you are the chief
of staff, and complained

10:36.000 --> 10:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a friend, look, said he
hadn't been able to spend time
with his children for the past

10:40.733 --> 10:42.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
four months.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what does he read
every day in the paper?

10:44.566 --> 10:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president called him
Reincy, refers to him as Reincy.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's going to be
ambassador to Greece.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are going to get him out.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to replace him.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who is going to replace him?

10:53.100 --> 10:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't be thrive, you can't
be productive in that kind
of an environment, where you

10:57.133 --> 11:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are looking over your shoulder
at who is conspiring over
here and what faction?

11:01.333 --> 11:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are you Kushner
or are you Bannon?

11:03.966 --> 11:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just -- Judy, they
work long hours, they work
hard, and they're uncertain.

11:10.666 --> 11:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're being sniped at.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no appreciation,
there's no sense
of shared mission.

11:14.866 --> 11:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the reward is when
you tell the president
what he wants to hear.

11:17.800 --> 11:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the antithesis of Jim
Baker and Ronald Reagan, where
a president was secure enough

11:24.833 --> 11:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and confident enough to ask a
chief of staff for advice that
he didn't want to hear, that

11:29.666 --> 11:31.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was tough.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does
all this matter, David,
quickly or inside baseball?

11:33.600 --> 11:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it
matters if we don't have an
effective administration.

11:36.166 --> 11:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus has the ultimate
job security right now, because
nobody else wants the job,

11:40.766 --> 11:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so they can't get rid
of him, because somebody
has got to do it.

11:43.033 --> 11:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think it makes the
prospect of a functional White
House very remote, because

11:49.466 --> 11:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can't get new people
because they don't want it.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The current people are in some
sort of war with each other.

11:53.466 --> 11:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time we hear
about something internal,
whether it was the
decision-making over global

11:56.066 --> 12:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warming, or the shambolic
attempt to get an FBI
director, it just sounds
like disorganization.

12:00.633 --> 12:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And more reports
tonight about investigations
with the Mueller probe.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
David Brooks, Mark
Shields, thank you both.
