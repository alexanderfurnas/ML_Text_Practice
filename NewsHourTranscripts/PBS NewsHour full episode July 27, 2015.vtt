WEBVTT

00:05.372 --> 00:06.473
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.575
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.575 --> 00:14.214
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: a buffer zone planned,
a cease-fire broken. Kurdish

00:14.214 --> 00:19.152
rebels fighting against ISIS in
Syria and Iraq come under fire
-- the delicate balance

00:19.152 --> 00:22.356
of alliances in a
war-torn region.

00:22.356 --> 00:27.027
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a historic
trip to Africa, President Obama
promotes peace, democracy

00:27.027 --> 00:29.096
and human rights.

00:29.096 --> 00:33.500
GWEN IFILL: Plus: a journey into
the history of World War II,
honoring the silent heroes

00:33.500 --> 00:37.471
who fought and died
in Normandy on D-Day.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.140
CATHY GORN, Executive Director,
National History Day: We know
about the generals. We know
about

00:40.140 --> 00:46.280
the really famous heroes, but
the average guy that went out
there and did what he had

00:46.280 --> 00:51.852
to do, they -- they are just
numbers. So these kids are
getting to know them.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.054
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:54.054 --> 00:59.226
(BREAK)

00:59.226 --> 01:13.373
GWEN IFILL: The death toll from
Sunday's Al-Shabaab suicide
bombing in Somalia's capital
rose

01:13.373 --> 01:18.912
today to 15. The facade of the
five-story hotel in Mogadishu
was sheared off when a

01:18.912 --> 01:23.383
car packed with explosives
rammed into its front gate.

01:23.383 --> 01:27.621
In neighboring Ethiopia today,
President Obama said the Islamic
militant's attack underscored

01:27.621 --> 01:31.091
the need to push back
against violent extremism.

01:31.091 --> 01:35.562
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Yesterday's
bombing in Mogadishu reminds us

01:35.562 --> 01:38.899
that terrorist groups like
Al-Shabaab offer nothing but
death and destruction and have

01:38.899 --> 01:42.002
to be stopped. We have
got more work to do.

01:42.002 --> 01:46.106
GWEN IFILL: The blast killed a
Kenyan diplomat, a Chinese
embassy guard and two
journalists,

01:46.106 --> 01:48.542
among others.

01:48.542 --> 01:53.280
JUDY WOODRUFF: Airstrikes
resumed in Yemen today, shortly
after a midnight humanitarian

01:53.280 --> 01:59.653
cease-fire went into effect. The
Saudi-led coalition pounded
Houthi targets near the

01:59.653 --> 02:06.226
rebel-held military base of
al-Anad and north of the port
city of Aden. Fifteen coalition

02:06.226 --> 02:11.965
troops were also accidentally
killed in two strikes in the
province of Lahj. The five-day

02:11.965 --> 02:17.704
truce was designed to get
much-needed humanitarian aid to
civilians in the hardest-hit
areas.

02:17.704 --> 02:23.176
GWEN IFILL: With no way to make
a looming loan repayment, Puerto
Rico has come up with

02:23.176 --> 02:28.782
a plan to raise up to $500
million through oil revenue.
That's only a fraction of the

02:28.782 --> 02:33.720
$3 billion it had hoped to raise
to refinance its debt. The
governor's chief of staff told

02:33.720 --> 02:37.224
reporters today the commonwealth
can't raise enough from its
public finance corporation

02:37.224 --> 02:40.460
bonds before an
August 1 deadline.

02:40.460 --> 02:45.766
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Olympic
Committee killed Boston's bid to
host the Summer Games

02:45.766 --> 02:52.539
in 2024 after the city raised
financial questions. Earlier
today, Boston's mayor express
worry

02:52.539 --> 02:57.444
the multibillion-dollar event
would put taxpayers at risk.
Marty Walsh said he didn't want
the

02:57.444 --> 03:02.849
city's residents to have to foot
the bill if local Olympic
organizers ran out of money.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.420
MARTY WALSH (D), Mayor of
Boston, Massachusetts: I refuse
to mortgage the future of the
city

03:06.420 --> 03:10.757
away. I refuse to put Boston on
the hook for overruns. And I
refuse to commit to signing

03:10.757 --> 03:14.828
a guarantee that uses taxpayers'
dollars to pay for the Olympics.

03:14.828 --> 03:19.166
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are only
seven weeks left to officially
nominate another city.

03:19.166 --> 03:25.872
The U.S. hasn't hosted a Summer
Olympics since the 1996 games in
Atlanta.

03:25.872 --> 03:31.945
In economic news, China's
Shanghai stock index plummeted
8.5 percent today. Most of that

03:31.945 --> 03:38.151
sharp decline was in the last
hour of trading. It was its
largest one-day loss since 2007,

03:38.151 --> 03:43.590
in spite of the Chinese
government's recent efforts to
stabilize the market. Analysts

03:43.590 --> 03:47.928
attributed the sell-off to
weaker-than-expected economic
data, including a drop in
Chinese

03:47.928 --> 03:51.498
factory activity and
industrial profits.

03:51.498 --> 03:56.870
GWEN IFILL: Fears of a slowdown
in China's economy pushed stocks
lower on Wall Street.

03:56.870 --> 04:03.176
The Dow Jones industrial average
slid 128 points to close at
17440. The Nasdaq fell

04:03.176 --> 04:08.181
more than 48 points, and the
S&P 500 lost 12 points.

04:08.181 --> 04:13.787
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bobbi Kristina
Brown, the daughter of R&B
singers Bobbi Brown and the late
Whitney

04:13.787 --> 04:19.059
Houston, has died. She passed
away Sunday at a hospice in
Duluth, Georgia, six months

04:19.059 --> 04:24.397
after she was found unresponsive
in a bathtub. She was 22 years
old.

04:24.397 --> 04:30.570
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a delicate balance of alliances
under threat after airstrikes

04:30.570 --> 04:35.408
hit ISIS and Kurdish targets;
President Obama promotes his
economic and human rights agenda

04:35.408 --> 04:43.617
for Africa, and much more.

04:43.617 --> 04:57.697
GWEN IFILL: Turkey and the U.S.
are working on plans to sweep
Islamic State fighters from

04:57.697 --> 05:02.903
a strip of land across the
Turkish border with Syria. This
comes as Istanbul steps up

05:02.903 --> 05:08.608
its air campaign against the
extremist group and its
crackdown on Kurdish insurgents.

05:08.608 --> 05:12.112
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports from Southern
Turkey, where many are holding

05:12.112 --> 05:14.881
their breaths.

05:14.881 --> 05:20.487
JANE FERGUSON: American fighter
jets will soon be launched
closer to the Islamic State

05:20.487 --> 05:24.925
group than ever before. From
this Turkish base at Incirlik,
they will pound the extremist

05:24.925 --> 05:28.528
group just across the
border in Syria.

05:28.528 --> 05:33.900
A new deal between the U.S. and
Turkey will allow Americans to
launch airstrikes from

05:33.900 --> 05:39.973
Turkish soil and increase
Turkey's role in the fight. This
is a major turnaround for

05:39.973 --> 05:46.179
Turkey, which has been
criticized for not doing enough
to tackle ISIS. Now deadly
attacks

05:46.179 --> 05:50.984
by the group along the border
have pushed the Turkish
government to act.

05:50.984 --> 05:58.058
At this outpost, 100 yards from
ISIS, a Turkish soldier was shot
dead by the group last week.

05:58.058 --> 06:04.197
Elbeyli village is the nearest
Turkish village. People here are
terrified that ISIS is simply

06:04.197 --> 06:09.669
too close. Some told us they
want more soldiers to keep them
safe.

06:09.669 --> 06:15.709
"We are so nervous," local
resident Mehmet Orman (ph) says.
"We want to see a normal

06:15.709 --> 06:20.046
life again here.
We cannot sleep."

06:20.046 --> 06:25.385
An hour down the road, the
group's power is alarmingly
apparent. In areas like this
along

06:25.385 --> 06:31.124
the Turkish border, ISIS are so
close to Turkey that you can see
their flags flying. Just

06:31.124 --> 06:36.930
behind me on that wall, there is
an ISIS flag, just feet away.
Now, what the Turkish government

06:36.930 --> 06:40.267
want to do is to push ISIS back
from these areas to create some
sort of safe zone or

06:40.267 --> 06:42.102
buffer.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.704
STEVEN COOK, Douglas Dillon
Fellow, Council on Foreign
Relations: It's clear that
Turkey

06:44.704 --> 06:48.742
believes that, once you
establish a safe zone, people
will go back to it.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.145
JANE FERGUSON: Steven Cook is a
Middle East scholar at the
Council on Foreign Relations.

06:52.145 --> 06:58.184
STEVEN COOK: It will become a
place from which moderate Syrian
forces will then expand in

06:58.184 --> 07:02.489
its march against the Islamic
State, as well as the Assad
regime. But, of course, one can

07:02.489 --> 07:07.527
imagine a whole host of
scenarios that pull Turkish
forces, as well as potentially
American

07:07.527 --> 07:11.331
forces further into
the Syria fight.

07:11.331 --> 07:16.870
JANE FERGUSON: The Islamic State
has also hit the Kurdish people
in Eastern Turkey.

07:16.870 --> 07:21.941
Ethnic Kurdish communities
straddle the border between
Turkey and Syria. Kurdish rebel
fighters

07:21.941 --> 07:27.814
inside Syria have been
battling ISIS for months.

07:27.814 --> 07:33.586
Last week, a suicide bomber
killed 32 young activists in the
Kurdish town of Suruc near

07:33.586 --> 07:39.659
the border inside Turkey. The
attack shocked the nation and
increased calls for action

07:39.659 --> 07:44.931
against ISIS. The young people
killed here were planning to
bring toys for children across

07:44.931 --> 07:51.037
the border a few miles to
Kobani, where Kurdish forces had
routed ISIS earlier this year.

07:51.037 --> 07:57.143
The five-month-long battle for
Kobani was a significant victory
for the Kurdish forces.

07:57.143 --> 08:03.583
It showed their growing strength
inside Syria. The Turkish
government watched with concern

08:03.583 --> 08:08.822
those gains in Kurdish
territory, fearful their own
Kurdish population may push
harder

08:08.822 --> 08:13.660
for independence. Now this new
deal with the American military
opens the door for Turkey

08:13.660 --> 08:18.231
to fight not only
ISIS, but the Kurds.

08:18.231 --> 08:25.238
And it's already happening.
Turkish jets bombed both ISIS in
Syria and Kurdish forces of the

08:25.238 --> 08:31.778
Turkish insurgent force called
the PKK, based in Iraq, as soon
as the deal was announced.

08:31.778 --> 08:39.486
A two-year-old cease-fire with
those Kurdish rebels in Turkey
is now believed to be over.

08:39.486 --> 08:49.729
People back in Suruc say Turkey
is only starting another war
inside its own territory.

08:49.729 --> 08:55.001
In the name of operations
against ISIS, they're attacking
Kurds," this man tells me. "We
don't

08:55.001 --> 09:00.874
accept this. I'm sure we don't
want war. Why don't we want war?
Look at Egypt, Kobani,

09:00.874 --> 09:04.978
Lebanon, Iraq. You can see
what happened there."

09:04.978 --> 09:10.250
Although American jets have been
helping the Kurds win territory
from ISIS in Syria, U.S.

09:10.250 --> 09:16.256
officials now say they support
Turkey's strikes against Kurdish
targets.

09:16.256 --> 09:21.261
Turkey's involvement in the war
against ISIS could prove a
crucial turning point in
U.S.-led

09:21.261 --> 09:26.666
coalition efforts to destroy the
group. Opening a new fighting
front against Kurds in the

09:26.666 --> 09:31.337
region simultaneously will
change the delicate balance of
alliances in an already complex

09:31.337 --> 09:32.572
war.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.810
GWEN IFILL: I spoke to Jane
Ferguson a short time ago.

09:36.810 --> 09:43.016
Jane, we're talking now about an
ISIL/ISIS-free zone right along
the border now. Why is it

09:43.016 --> 09:46.419
that Turkey is
interested in this now?

09:46.419 --> 09:50.924
JANE FERGUSON: Well, Turkey is
under increasing pressure. The
Turkish president is under
pressure

09:50.924 --> 09:57.964
from his own population to do
something about ISIS and not to
be seen as being soft on terror.

09:57.964 --> 10:03.736
Violence in the past week has
shocked Turkey. But what's
complicated issues for the
Turkish

10:03.736 --> 10:09.309
government is the fact that
there are so many Kurdish rebels
on their border with Syria,

10:09.309 --> 10:14.914
on the Syrian side of the
border. Those rebels have been
making massive gains against
ISIS

10:14.914 --> 10:19.252
and taking territory away from
ISIS whenever they have
victories, which they have had
in

10:19.252 --> 10:21.354
the recent months.

10:21.354 --> 10:25.425
That complicates things for
Turkey because the Turkish
government are dealing with a

10:25.425 --> 10:32.098
large Kurdish minority in their
country who, for decades, have
been pushing for independence.

10:32.098 --> 10:36.503
And they, of course, don't want
to see any bolstering of Kurdish
calls for independence

10:36.503 --> 10:39.539
right on their border
and in their territory.

10:39.539 --> 10:43.142
GWEN IFILL: Is there also -- you
mentioned the word complication
more than once. There

10:43.142 --> 10:48.181
are a lot of complications here.
And another of them is Syria
itself, the degree to which

10:48.181 --> 10:54.420
anything involved in this
collaboration could help the
pro-Assad forces in Syria.

10:54.420 --> 11:00.293
JANE FERGUSON: This, of course,
does complicate things, because
it will of course be fighting

11:00.293 --> 11:04.964
ISIS and not necessarily
fighting Assad, and that is
something that the Turkish
government

11:04.964 --> 11:08.234
have been criticizing
the coalition for.

11:08.234 --> 11:14.841
They really wanted airstrikes
against Assad. They wanted a
no-fly zone imposed. So for

11:14.841 --> 11:19.245
them, they had been holding out
for that. But at the minute,
it's likely that this is

11:19.245 --> 11:22.715
really just going -- the details
of this deal will be revealed
tomorrow, probably most likely

11:22.715 --> 11:25.885
at that NATO meeting.

11:25.885 --> 11:31.190
So we won't know the details
just yet. But the plan, as far
as officials are telling

11:31.190 --> 11:36.396
journalists, would be to create
this buffer zone to allow
certain rebel groups, not
Kurdish

11:36.396 --> 11:41.334
rebel groups, and certain rebel
groups that are being described
as moderate, to take over

11:41.334 --> 11:46.806
that specific area. That would
give them room to resupply. It
would give them room to
maneuver,

11:46.806 --> 11:53.379
room to basically operate in the
area around Aleppo, not in
Aleppo city.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.081
GWEN IFILL: But we don't know
how far this buffer zone you're
talking about would actually

11:55.081 --> 11:56.883
extend.

11:56.883 --> 12:01.854
JANE FERGUSON: That's not clear
yet how far in it would go. It's
unlikely that it would

12:01.854 --> 12:07.126
go of course all the way to
Aleppo city. That would be an
enormous military target.

12:07.126 --> 12:11.898
But if it could just move in far
enough to be able to push ISIS
away from the border,

12:11.898 --> 12:16.269
so that they no longer can touch
the Turkish border, that would
be significant in itself

12:16.269 --> 12:20.974
militarily because that would
affect their link to the outside
world, essentially.

12:20.974 --> 12:28.147
GWEN IFILL: Jane Ferguson
reporting for us tonight in
Turkey, thank you.

12:28.147 --> 12:38.858
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
continued his visit to Africa
today, making a personal push

12:38.858 --> 12:45.431
for peace and calls
for democracy.

12:45.431 --> 12:53.306
"The Star-Spangled Banner"
greeted the first American
president to visit Africa's
second

12:53.306 --> 12:59.779
most-populous country. But after
the pomp, the president spoke of
urgent business, not

12:59.779 --> 13:06.386
in Ethiopia, but in its neighbor
to the West, South Sudan. Since
the U.S. helped midwife

13:06.386 --> 13:12.225
the founding of the world's
newest nation in 2011, civil war
has left tens of thousands

13:12.225 --> 13:16.095
dead and displaced
two million more.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.197
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Our hope is that
we can actually bring about

13:18.197 --> 13:22.935
the kind of peace that the
people of South Sudan so
desperately need.

13:22.935 --> 13:29.075
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president and
African leaders discussed
options, including sanctions, if

13:29.075 --> 13:35.114
a peace deal is not reached by
August 17. Mr. Obama urged
inclusion, and respect for

13:35.114 --> 13:39.452
human rights, in a news
conference with Ethiopia's prime
minister.

13:39.452 --> 13:44.023
BARACK OBAMA: I believe that,
when all voices are being heard,
when people know that they

13:44.023 --> 13:47.827
are included in the political
process, that makes a country
stronger and more successful

13:47.827 --> 13:50.096
and more innovative.

13:50.096 --> 13:54.300
JUDY WOODRUFF: That message was
also central to the president's
visit to Kenya over the

13:54.300 --> 13:57.403
weekend.

13:57.403 --> 14:04.343
It was a highly anticipated
visit to his father's homeland
and Mr. Obama's first in nearly
three

14:04.343 --> 14:10.249
decades. Kenyans lined the
streets to welcome the
president, whom they see as one
of their

14:10.249 --> 14:16.589
own. But security precautions
prevented him from greeting many
of the residents, so thrilled

14:16.589 --> 14:20.827
to see the Kenyan-American
president, as he referred to
himself, or visit his father's

14:20.827 --> 14:23.763
village.

14:23.763 --> 14:29.235
He did, however, attend a
private dinner with members of
his family, including his
grandmother

14:29.235 --> 14:34.707
and half-sister. And he cut a
rug at a state dinner held in
his honor, joining in on a

14:34.707 --> 14:39.112
traditional dance.

14:39.112 --> 14:46.085
Aside from the celebrations, the
president also pushed his human
rights message. Kenya's

14:46.085 --> 14:50.690
president, Uhuru Kenyatta,
emphasized the threats of
terrorism facing his country,
and

14:50.690 --> 14:54.293
promised to work toward
equal rights for all.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.429
UHURU KENYATTA, Kenyan
President: We agreed together
that we can build a future in
which

14:56.429 --> 15:01.367
our people of all faiths,
cultures live peacefully
together.

15:01.367 --> 15:07.373
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the country
has a checkered record when it
comes to human rights. In 2010,

15:07.373 --> 15:11.677
Kenyatta himself was named a
suspect in crimes against
humanity by the International
Criminal

15:11.677 --> 15:14.614
Court.

15:14.614 --> 15:20.253
President Obama spoke about
corruption, ethnic divisions,
and human rights, urging Kenyans

15:20.253 --> 15:26.092
to -- quote -- "choose the path
to progress." And he had stern
words for the treatment of

15:26.092 --> 15:31.631
people based on sexual
orientation, even as Kenyatta
dismissed gay rights as a
nonissue

15:31.631 --> 15:34.567
for Kenyans.

15:34.567 --> 15:41.307
BARACK OBAMA: So, I'm
unequivocal on this. The idea
that they are going to be
treated

15:41.307 --> 15:47.146
differently or abused because of
who they love is wrong, full
stop.

15:47.146 --> 15:51.851
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, in
Addis Ababa, Mr. Obama will be
the first American president

15:51.851 --> 15:56.756
to address the African Union.

15:56.756 --> 16:02.195
Joining me now to discuss the
visit and President Obama's
record on Africa is career
diplomat

16:02.195 --> 16:07.466
and former Assistant Secretary
of State for the Bureau of
African Affairs under President

16:07.466 --> 16:13.773
Obama Johnnie Carson. He's now a
senior adviser at the U.S.
Institute of Peace. And William

16:13.773 --> 16:18.811
Gumede, he's an author and
professor at the University of
the Witwatersrand in South
Africa.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.147
And we welcome you both.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.415
WILLIAM GUMEDE, Professor,
University of the Witwatersrand:
Thank you.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.217
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Professor -- welcome.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.520
Professor Gumede, let me begin
with you. How do you think this
trip has gone, and how much

16:27.520 --> 16:30.256
difference do you think
it's going to make?

16:30.256 --> 16:34.961
WILLIAM GUMEDE: Unfortunately,
almost -- this trip is almost
coming too late, at the tail

16:34.961 --> 16:37.697
end of the Obama presidency.

16:37.697 --> 16:43.135
And you must understand what has
been happening the last couple
of years in Africa. We had

16:43.135 --> 16:55.014
-- China has become a really big
factor in Africa's growth and
influence in Africa. So,

16:55.014 --> 17:00.853
Obama coming to Africa, he has
made the right democratic
noises, but he's almost a little

17:00.853 --> 17:04.023
bit too late.

17:04.023 --> 17:08.527
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador
Carson, what about that? Is the
president coming too late?

17:08.527 --> 17:10.329
JOHNNIE CARSON, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State:
Absolutely not.

17:10.329 --> 17:16.402
I think that, in fact, is
turning out to be a very
substantive and positive trip,
with

17:16.402 --> 17:23.309
President Obama focusing on
expanding trade and commercial
opportunities with Africa,

17:23.309 --> 17:27.780
with these two countries and the
United States, and strengthening
the security partnership

17:27.780 --> 17:33.552
that the United States has had
with both Kenya and Ethiopia.

17:33.552 --> 17:40.726
The president is also getting a
chance to talk about some of the
new initiatives that

17:40.726 --> 17:48.868
he has been responsible for,
Power Africa, to substantially
increase the amount of
electrical

17:48.868 --> 17:55.341
power reaching African cities
and communities, Feed the
Future, which is designed to
promote

17:55.341 --> 18:02.748
a green revolution across
Africa, to help end to
starvation and famine at the
village

18:02.748 --> 18:09.322
level and to expand
agro-industries at the upper
level, and particularly a focus
on youth,

18:09.322 --> 18:11.590
the next generation.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.895
So this is an important trip,
and it's his fourth trip to the
continent and may not in

18:15.895 --> 18:18.631
fact be his last.

18:18.631 --> 18:24.670
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Professor
Gumede, these are some specifics
you heard Ambassador Carson

18:24.670 --> 18:29.442
listing here that have to do
with the economy, that have to
do with working with young
people.

18:29.442 --> 18:36.048
WILLIAM GUMEDE: Just to repeat
what has been happening over the
last couple of years, we

18:36.048 --> 18:40.786
have seen the longest growth
spurt in Africa, you know, I
mean, since independence and
since

18:40.786 --> 18:43.089
the Second World War.

18:43.089 --> 18:47.693
And if you look at how the
dynamics of this growth, the
dynamics of this growth has been

18:47.693 --> 18:54.734
driven really, you know, by
newly emerging markets buying
Africa's products, getting

18:54.734 --> 19:00.306
engaged in Africa, whether it's
China, Brazil, or India. That is
the nature of -- there's

19:00.306 --> 19:06.612
been a big game-changing couple
of moments the last couple of
years in Africa.

19:06.612 --> 19:13.386
And the U.S., you know, has
almost lagged behind and really
going to have to work much

19:13.386 --> 19:20.259
harder, you know, to catch up
with what has happened on the
continent. If you just think

19:20.259 --> 19:27.900
about it, at the moment, civil
society on the continent, where
the new African leadership

19:27.900 --> 19:32.772
should be coming from, you know,
have struggled the last couple
of years, because, you know,

19:32.772 --> 19:35.441
the foreign funding that they
used to get in the past has
declined after the global

19:35.441 --> 19:38.711
financial crisis.

19:38.711 --> 19:44.383
And many of the civil societies,
the democrats in Africa have
struggled and had hoped that

19:44.383 --> 19:48.087
the U.S. would have played a
much bigger, much stronger role
in providing them with

19:48.087 --> 19:50.890
capacity, yes.

19:50.890 --> 19:56.695
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
-- put that question to
Ambassador Carson.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.499
Why -- to listen with to what
the professor is saying, it
sounds as if the U.S. has
dropped

20:00.499 --> 20:03.669
the ball, China has been active
there, other countries, that
there has been an opportunity

20:03.669 --> 20:07.406
to engage, and the U.S.
hasn't taken advantage of it.

20:07.406 --> 20:14.747
JOHNNIE CARSON: The United
States has been deeply engaged
in Africa, not only as a
development

20:14.747 --> 20:21.854
assistance partner, but
increasingly as a trading
partner as well.

20:21.854 --> 20:28.427
The United States remains one of
the largest single bilateral
contributors to development

20:28.427 --> 20:35.668
assistance in Africa. And the
United States remains one of
Africa's largest trading
partners.

20:35.668 --> 20:42.441
I think that President Obama,
over the last several years, has
gone out of his way to

20:42.441 --> 20:48.180
encourage American businessmen
and investors to increasingly
look at Africa as the last

20:48.180 --> 20:51.951
global economic frontier.

20:51.951 --> 20:56.622
You may recall, Judy, that, in
2014, President Obama held the
first U.S.-Africa Summit.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.724
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

20:58.724 --> 21:02.995
JOHNNIE CARSON: And the first
day of that summit was devoted
all to economic, commercial

21:02.995 --> 21:05.264
and investment interests.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.702
JUDY WOODRUFF: Professor Gumede,
it almost sounds like you're
talking about two different

21:09.702 --> 21:16.008
situations, with your
description that the U.S. has
been absent, and Ambassador
Carson

21:16.008 --> 21:19.345
saying the U.S. has been very
engaged. How do you account for
that?

21:19.345 --> 21:23.816
WILLIAM GUMEDE: Well, the U.S.
has been engaged with Africa,
but, you know, it's been engaged

21:23.816 --> 21:33.759
almost in the wrong way. It's
been engaged sort of in the old
way -- let's call it your

21:33.759 --> 21:44.637
old pre-financial crisis ways,
whereas Africa has moved and,
you know, and the world,
unfortunately,

21:44.637 --> 21:50.009
has moved, and for developing
countries have moved, and Africa
has also moved.

21:50.009 --> 21:57.349
So, for me, the U.S. is really
catching up and needs to do
quite a lot to catch up. But

21:57.349 --> 22:04.590
just in terms of looking into
the future, I think, you know,
if Obama, if this trip,

22:04.590 --> 22:11.664
if out of this trip could be a
focus on African civil society,
because that's where the future

22:11.664 --> 22:15.367
leadership are coming -- will be
coming from. That's where the
future democrats are going

22:15.367 --> 22:20.739
to come from, if they can be
supported and given the
capacity, which has not happened

22:20.739 --> 22:22.374
the last couple of years.

22:22.374 --> 22:25.811
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Well, we hear you.

22:25.811 --> 22:30.482
And, Ambassador Carson, I do
want to give you a chance just
quickly to comment on the

22:30.482 --> 22:38.357
president's remarks in his
public speeches in Africa about
human rights, about sexual

22:38.357 --> 22:41.493
orientation, the lack of respect
for that. Are these the kinds of
statements that are

22:41.493 --> 22:45.164
going to have resonance
on the continent?

22:45.164 --> 22:51.036
JOHNNIE CARSON: Absolutely,
because I think that democracy,
strengthening democratic
institutions

22:51.036 --> 22:58.744
and promoting good governance
are at the basis of having a
well -- good, well-organized
society.

22:58.744 --> 23:06.919
I think that a society that
protects the rights of
individuals also protects the
intellectual

23:06.919 --> 23:15.694
property of those individuals. A
society that protects civil
liberties also protects
corporate

23:15.694 --> 23:22.067
liberties. And I think a society
that is open and inclusive is a
society that generates

23:22.067 --> 23:27.239
both good idea and greater
productivity from both men and
women.

23:27.239 --> 23:34.647
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ambassador
Johnnie Carson, Professor
William Gumede, we thank you
both.

23:34.647 --> 23:44.690
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

23:44.690 --> 23:50.195
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
student historians document the
stories of silent heroes at
Normandy;

23:50.195 --> 23:56.402
record fines for Fiat Chrysler
after failing to recall millions
of unsafe cars; and breaking

23:56.402 --> 24:05.210
silence, the personal accounts
of 35 women who accuse Bill
Cosby of assault.

24:05.210 --> 24:16.922
But, first, the 2016
presidential contenders are on
the attack, each jockeying to
get the

24:16.922 --> 24:21.694
chance to secure a place on the
stage for the first Republican
debate in Cleveland in

24:21.694 --> 24:25.898
10 days. The polls are getting
tighter and their rhetoric is
getting hotter, just in

24:25.898 --> 24:28.801
time for Politics Monday.

24:28.801 --> 24:33.372
That's with Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report and Tamara
Keith of NPR.

24:33.372 --> 24:37.743
Let's start with Mike Huckabee,
shall we? Mike Huckabee said --
and we can take a look

24:37.743 --> 24:43.515
at what he had to say -- that
"The president's foreign policy
is the most feckless in American

24:43.515 --> 24:48.020
history. It is so naive that he
would trust the Iranians. By
doing so, he will take the

24:48.020 --> 24:52.057
Israelis and march them
to the door of the oven."

24:52.057 --> 24:57.129
Obviously, that was a Holocaust
reference. And before I ask you
to weigh in on that,

24:57.129 --> 24:59.431
let's hear what the president
had to say in response when he
was asked about it while

24:59.431 --> 25:01.900
traveling in Africa.

25:01.900 --> 25:07.906
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: When you get
rhetoric like this, mash it gets

25:07.906 --> 25:17.649
attention, and maybe this is
just an effort to push Mr. Trump
out of the headlines. But

25:17.649 --> 25:21.854
it's not the kind of leadership
that's needed for America right
now.

25:21.854 --> 25:27.059
And I don't think that's what
anybody, Democratic, Republican
or independent, is looking for

25:27.059 --> 25:29.628
out of their political leaders.

25:29.628 --> 25:33.799
GWEN IFILL: It should be said,
Amy, that no one asked the
president about Donald Trump,

25:33.799 --> 25:35.934
but he managed to bring it up.
Democrats are kind of happy
about that.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.269
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: What a surprise.

25:37.269 --> 25:40.806
GWEN IFILL: What is this
politics of provocation we're
talking about now that we're
seeing?

25:40.806 --> 25:43.142
AMY WALTER: I think the
president is correct that it
does have a lot to do with the
fact

25:43.142 --> 25:46.478
that Donald Trump is now
sucking up all the oxygen.

25:46.478 --> 25:51.717
And, in fact, he is sucking up
that place that so many of these
other candidates thought

25:51.717 --> 25:56.255
they would be sitting in right
now, which is the
anti-establishment,
angry-at-the-system

25:56.255 --> 26:03.095
candidate. There are plenty of
people in that position or vying
for that position, Ben Carson,

26:03.095 --> 26:10.135
Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike
Huckabee. They're not getting
the attention. Donald Trump is,

26:10.135 --> 26:14.873
and they are, as such,
increasingly putting their
rhetoric up and putting their
antics

26:14.873 --> 26:18.811
up in order to try
to dethrone him.

26:18.811 --> 26:22.948
GWEN IFILL: So, there's Donald
Trump. There's Lindsey Graham
responding by beating up his

26:22.948 --> 26:30.022
cell phone or doing something.
And there's Governor Perry who
said that maybe after -- in

26:30.022 --> 26:33.058
the wake of a shooting in
Lafayette, Louisiana, that maybe
moviegoers should bring guns.
Everybody

26:33.058 --> 26:34.793
seems to be trying
to top each other.

26:34.793 --> 26:37.696
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's all about the
debate.

26:37.696 --> 26:41.934
There's a debate coming up. They
all want a place on that debate
stage. Only the top

26:41.934 --> 26:48.674
10 in national polls earn a
place on that first debate
stage. And how do you raise your

26:48.674 --> 26:53.278
profile? How do you get in the
top 10? Well, some of them are
running ads. Some of them

26:53.278 --> 26:59.852
are taking chain saws to the tax
code or golf clubs to their cell
phones.

26:59.852 --> 27:05.023
They're trying to get attention.
They're jumping up and down and
saying, hi. Perhaps if you

27:05.023 --> 27:09.294
get a call from a pollster, you
will support me, so that I can
get on that debate stage,

27:09.294 --> 27:14.066
and it's national polls, not the
state polls in Iowa and New
Hampshire, where more maybe

27:14.066 --> 27:16.001
people are paying attention.

27:16.001 --> 27:18.270
GWEN IFILL: Well, we're going to
talk about those polls in a
minute, but first I want

27:18.270 --> 27:20.372
to talk a little bit about
what's getting lost in some of
this attack and counterattack,

27:20.372 --> 27:20.672
which is policy.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.908
AMY WALTER: Hmm.

27:22.908 --> 27:25.577
GWEN IFILL: What do we know --
hmm. What do we know about
Donald Trump and what he
actually

27:25.577 --> 27:27.746
believes, Amy?

27:27.746 --> 27:30.382
AMY WALTER: I don't know what he
actually believes in. I don't
know if he actually believes

27:30.382 --> 27:32.751
in anything.

27:32.751 --> 27:37.256
And, honestly, he's been all
over the map, if you look at
statements that he's made in

27:37.256 --> 27:41.026
his political career, I guess,
if we could call it that, where
he has flirted with running

27:41.026 --> 27:43.829
for president before. Remember,
he flirted with running as an
independent. He's talked

27:43.829 --> 27:45.998
about being a Democrat.
He's been a Republican.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.166
GWEN IFILL: He's been
pro-life, pro-choice,

27:48.166 --> 27:51.136
AMY WALTER: He's been pro-life,
pro-choice. He's said Hillary
Clinton is a very good person,

27:51.136 --> 27:55.274
he likes her very much. Now he's
saying she's terrible, she would
be a terrible president.

27:55.274 --> 27:58.710
He's talked about a surtax on
very, very wealthy people. Now
he's talking about how terrible

27:58.710 --> 28:01.313
the tax code is.

28:01.313 --> 28:05.551
He has really been all over the
map. Look, the reality is, there
is no there there when

28:05.551 --> 28:10.689
it comes to Donald Trump. What
he's been brilliant at is
exploiting the anger that's been
there

28:10.689 --> 28:12.925
and the frustration that's been
there on Republican voters. The
Tea Party tapped into it. Tea

28:12.925 --> 28:15.727
Party candidates tapped into it.

28:15.727 --> 28:19.164
But, as I said, there's only
this much vote there. Donald
Trump is getting all of it.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.934
Nobody else is able to
peel some of it away.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.570
GWEN IFILL: Including Hillary
Clinton, who in the last week
has given major speeches

28:24.570 --> 28:29.007
on the economy and on climate
change. Is it breaking through?

28:29.007 --> 28:34.613
TAMARA KEITH: Not really. I
think that Donald Trump is
monopolizing the headlines. And
I

28:34.613 --> 28:39.751
think, also, it's summer and
people aren't necessarily ready
for a lot of policy.

28:39.751 --> 28:45.324
But what I think the Clinton
campaign is doing here is, the
way you get coverage,
traditionally,

28:45.324 --> 28:50.262
is you have a horse race, and
then people cover the horse
race. Well, she doesn't truly

28:50.262 --> 28:53.465
have a horse race right now. And
so she is filling the horse race
void by doing these

28:53.465 --> 28:56.468
policy rollouts.

28:56.468 --> 29:01.340
But there hasn't been a ton of
detail in any of them and there
hasn't been a lot of meat

29:01.340 --> 29:04.242
yet. She keeps saying, well,
that will come later in the
summer.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.145
GWEN IFILL: But there has been
more of a horse race lately, at
least the horse race to the

29:07.145 --> 29:09.348
debate stage, than
we have seen before.

29:09.348 --> 29:15.354
So, let's look at the latest NBC
News/Marist poll in New
Hampshire and in Iowa. In New

29:15.354 --> 29:20.626
Hampshire, Donald Trump, for
everything you say, is leading.
He's at 21 percent, followed

29:20.626 --> 29:25.964
by George W. -- I'm sorry -- Jeb
Bush at 14 percent, Scott
Walker, the governor of
Wisconsin,

29:25.964 --> 29:28.967
at 12, and John Kasich at 7
percent, rounding out the top
four.

29:28.967 --> 29:32.037
That's kind of a big turnaround.

29:32.037 --> 29:35.607
AMY WALTER: Yes, absolutely.
Nobody would have said three
months ago that Donald Trump

29:35.607 --> 29:38.577
would be topping the polls.

29:38.577 --> 29:44.182
But if you said to me, will
there be an anti-establishment
Tea Party candidate up in the
top three in

29:44.182 --> 29:48.887
New Hampshire? Of course. Right
now, that happens to be Donald
Trump. The person I think

29:48.887 --> 29:53.091
who is benefiting the most, by
the way, is Jeb Bush, because if
you notice in this poll

29:53.091 --> 29:56.828
and if we see the Iowa poll,
he's in the top three in all of
these. Again, it's consolidating

29:56.828 --> 30:01.266
an anti-Bush vote,
anti-establishment vote to one
person.

30:01.266 --> 30:04.336
It's everybody else that is
desperate now for attention,
including the one person who

30:04.336 --> 30:06.872
doesn't show up in there very
much, and that's Marco Rubio.

30:06.872 --> 30:10.409
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
Democrats, because even though
Hillary Clinton is still

30:10.409 --> 30:15.280
well ahead in these polls,
Bernie Sanders is kind of
creeping up. She is at 47
percent

30:15.280 --> 30:18.350
in New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders
is following at 34 percent. But
that's up 13 points since

30:18.350 --> 30:19.985
February.

30:19.985 --> 30:23.822
TAMARA KEITH: I think what has
happened is that Bernie Sanders
has truly consolidated

30:23.822 --> 30:27.893
the anti-Hillary vote.

30:27.893 --> 30:32.364
Martin O'Malley is scrapping,
scraping and trying to get a
little bit of it. Lincoln

30:32.364 --> 30:38.170
Chafee would love a little bit
of it. Jim Webb would love a
little bit of it. But really

30:38.170 --> 30:44.643
Bernie Sanders came in and he
just -- he became the
alternative to Hillary. He's the
thing

30:44.643 --> 30:47.579
that's there for all of those
people who just -- who say
things like, I don't want
another

30:47.579 --> 30:50.115
Clinton or another Bush.

30:50.115 --> 30:54.920
GWEN IFILL: Let's go to Iowa
briefly, where the numbers are
actually not so different,

30:54.920 --> 30:58.623
except, in this case, in Iowa,
Donald Trump is coming in
second. We have Scott Walker,

30:58.623 --> 31:02.561
the Midwestern governor, up
top. Why is that different?

31:02.561 --> 31:05.731
AMY WALTER: Again, I think
you're still seeing the same
three things here, where you
have

31:05.731 --> 31:08.600
Bush somewhere here as the
establishment candidate.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.370
You have Donald Trump, who, by
the way, if you look at his
overall approval ratings in

31:12.370 --> 31:16.808
that poll, I think he has
actually peaked. His approval --
disapproval ratings among

31:16.808 --> 31:22.547
Republicans are in the high 40s,
and in New Hampshire in the mid
to high 50s.

31:22.547 --> 31:26.084
So I don't know if he can get
much higher than where he is.
The question is, if there

31:26.084 --> 31:30.188
are still 15 people, serious
candidates in the race as we go
into those primaries, will

31:30.188 --> 31:33.458
21 percent be enough to
actually win one of these?

31:33.458 --> 31:37.095
GWEN IFILL: And Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders are one and
two in Iowa as well.

31:37.095 --> 31:41.032
But I want to talk about the
favorable/unfavorables, because
when you talk about Donald Trump
leading,

31:41.032 --> 31:45.337
he's still incredibly unpopular
as well in the public at large.

31:45.337 --> 31:49.474
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, that is a
problem that he has. He has huge
name I.D. and people have

31:49.474 --> 31:53.945
strong opinions about them and
many of them are not big fans.

31:53.945 --> 31:59.451
Or many of the people say that
they don't expect that he would
ultimately go on to be

31:59.451 --> 32:05.223
the Republican nominee, which is
not a great sign for the staying
power of his candidacy.

32:05.223 --> 32:09.127
Now, I will also just say, this
time in 2011, Michele Bachmann
was riding high.

32:09.127 --> 32:11.096
GWEN IFILL: President
Bachmann, yes.

32:11.096 --> 32:15.333
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And Herman
Cain was then riding high. There
was like an escalator to

32:15.333 --> 32:19.070
a cliff. And that could well be
happening this time, sort of the
alternative to the

32:19.070 --> 32:20.539
establishment candidate.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.974
GWEN IFILL: I will remind you of
that after we get to the debates
and Donald Trump is

32:22.974 --> 32:24.409
still there.

32:24.409 --> 32:25.210
(LAUGHTER)

32:25.210 --> 32:28.847
AMY WALTER: That's right.

32:28.847 --> 32:35.153
GWEN IFILL: Tamara Keith, Amy
Walter, thank you both very
much.

32:35.153 --> 32:39.124
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.

32:39.124 --> 32:44.062
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: an effort to
make history more meaningful by
bring the classroom to

32:44.062 --> 32:46.665
where it happened.

32:46.665 --> 32:51.970
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown
traveled to Normandy, France, to
see a program that uses a
personal

32:51.970 --> 32:57.075
approach to highlight the
sacrifices made during World War
II. The report is part of

32:57.075 --> 33:00.745
our American Graduate series, a
public media initiative funded
by the Corporation for Public

33:00.745 --> 33:03.148
Broadcasting.

33:03.148 --> 33:11.256
APRIL BROWN: It has been more
than 70-years since Broadway
Valentine Sims, Eugene Mlot

33:11.256 --> 33:15.260
(ph), and Francisco Blas (ph)
died during the invasion of
Normandy, the turning point

33:15.260 --> 33:20.332
in the allied campaign to
liberate Europe from Nazi
Germany in World War II.

33:20.332 --> 33:26.137
But their sacrifice and that of
13 other servicemen is being
remembered and honored in
graveside

33:26.137 --> 33:31.476
eulogies at the American
cemetery perched above Omaha
Beach in Northern France.

33:31.476 --> 33:36.181
STUDENT: Technician 5th Class
Broadway Valentine Sims was born
in 1916 in the remote town of

33:36.181 --> 33:38.516
Elizabethton, Tennessee.

33:38.516 --> 33:43.021
STUDENT: Eugene G. Mlot (ph) was
an orderly worker, shipping
clerk and electrician with

33:43.021 --> 33:47.025
four years of high school under
his belt when he joined the Army
Air Force in 1942.

33:47.025 --> 33:51.963
STUDENT: Francisco Blas embodied
the characteristics of bravery,
courage and unwavering loyalty

33:51.963 --> 33:56.601
as he faced segregation,
uncertainty and even death
itself.

33:56.601 --> 34:01.239
APRIL BROWN: This is an
important part of National
History Day's Normandy
Institute.

34:01.239 --> 34:04.109
VANESSA TAYLOR, Student: I will
never sacrifice of Henry and
Louie made for their country

34:04.109 --> 34:06.945
and the sacrifice
they made for me.

34:06.945 --> 34:10.615
CATHY GORN, Executive Director,
National History Day: The
program started because of a
concern

34:10.615 --> 34:15.854
that today's young people don't
really understand what sacrifice
is all about, sacrifice and

34:15.854 --> 34:18.757
freedom and how those
two fit together.

34:18.757 --> 34:23.495
APRIL BROWN: As executive
director of National History
Day, Cathy Gorn has led 15
student-teacher

34:23.495 --> 34:29.668
teams on a journey through
history each summer over the
past five years. By following in

34:29.668 --> 34:32.437
the footsteps of those who
served and died during the
Normandy campaign, they learn
about

34:32.437 --> 34:35.473
D-Day and World War II.

34:35.473 --> 34:39.778
CATHY GORN: We have asked them
to look at someone from their
own backyards, their own

34:39.778 --> 34:44.950
community, or at least their own
state, and find out all they
could about this individual

34:44.950 --> 34:49.654
who gave that ultimate sacrifice
-- many of these people were not
too much older than

34:49.654 --> 34:54.793
the kids that we bring here --
and to honor them in way that
gives them their history

34:54.793 --> 34:57.128
back.

34:57.128 --> 35:02.233
APRIL BROWN: Before they even go
to France, teachers and students
selected for the institute

35:02.233 --> 35:08.273
spend months becoming
historians. They contact living
family members, collect
pictures, love

35:08.273 --> 35:13.778
letters and official military
documents, hoping to unlock any
clues about their silent hero.

35:13.778 --> 35:20.051
CATHY GORN: We know about the
generals. We know about the
really famous heroes, but the

35:20.051 --> 35:26.057
average guy that went out there
and did what he had to do, they
are just numbers. So these

35:26.057 --> 35:28.626
kids are getting to know them.

35:28.626 --> 35:32.697
APRIL BROWN: There is a stop in
Washington, D.C., to learn more
about the war beyond what

35:32.697 --> 35:39.137
can be taken from a textbook. At
the National Archives in College
Park, Maryland, the teams

35:39.137 --> 35:43.575
work with some of the nation's
leading caretakers of World War
II artifacts, hoping to uncover

35:43.575 --> 35:47.612
further details amid the
Archives' four billion
documents.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.848
NORWOOD THOMAS JR., World War II
Veteran: We had several planes
that crashed with all

35:49.848 --> 35:52.150
men on board.

35:52.150 --> 35:57.789
APRIL BROWN: But the human costs
of war can perhaps best be told
by those who were there;

35:57.789 --> 36:03.528
92-year-old Norwood Thomas Jr.
fought as part of famed 101st
Airborne Division. He was among

36:03.528 --> 36:08.566
the first Allied troops to land
in Normandy, parachuting into a
field under cover of darkness.

36:08.566 --> 36:15.507
NORWOOD THOMAS JR.: On the drop
zone that I landed on, we were
supposed to have three

36:15.507 --> 36:24.416
battalions of infantry. This
would be approximately 2,000
men. I landed at 1:21 in the
morning.

36:24.416 --> 36:30.422
Daybreak, we moved off that drop
zone, we were able to garner 95
men.

36:30.422 --> 36:35.660
APRIL BROWN: When they get to
France, it's time to tell the
stories of their servicemen,

36:35.660 --> 36:42.233
among them a pilot, a technician
and two radiomen, twin brothers
from Nebraska.

36:42.233 --> 36:46.404
Vanessa Taylor from Ainsworth,
Nebraska, learned Henry and
Louie Pieper died together when

36:46.404 --> 36:49.274
their ship struck a mine
in the English Channel.

36:49.274 --> 36:52.444
VANESSA TAYLOR: Their parents
had received a letter from the
twins only two days before

36:52.444 --> 36:57.015
their death, stating: "Do not
worry about us. We are
together."

36:57.015 --> 37:01.619
SPENCER VALENTI, Student: So he
probably landed like right
there.

37:01.619 --> 37:06.591
APRIL BROWN: Spencer Valenti and
his teacher, Thomas Leighty (ph)
of Wilmington, Delaware,

37:06.591 --> 37:10.762
studied the life of medic
William Verderamo (ph), who saw
action in North Africa and
Sicily

37:10.762 --> 37:12.831
before the Battle of Normandy.

37:12.831 --> 37:16.768
SPENCER VALENTI: A lot of his
family members say that he was a
really outgoing sort of

37:16.768 --> 37:20.605
person, that he'd always say --
when he registered for the Army,
that he would always say that

37:20.605 --> 37:22.941
he's going out to
save the world.

37:22.941 --> 37:29.614
APRIL BROWN: Private Verderamo
was killed on June 6, 1944
D-Day. Spencer uncovered a

37:29.614 --> 37:33.885
letter that was later sent by
the Army Effects Bureau to
soldier's wife of six months,
Mary.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.887
It reads:

37:35.887 --> 37:40.225
MAN: "I regret to advise that
included among your husband's
effects are some photos which

37:40.225 --> 37:44.195
are damaged, apparently by
bloodstains. I shall appreciate
it if you will indicate whether

37:44.195 --> 37:47.899
you desire these articles
forwarded with his property."

37:47.899 --> 37:51.903
AUDREY CALOVICH, Student: It
makes it very real and vivid.
And I do have a very vivid

37:51.903 --> 37:56.908
imagination. So, I'm able to put
myself in stories. I'm able to
imagine if this is where

37:56.908 --> 37:59.878
they ran up the
beach, got show down.

37:59.878 --> 38:04.716
APRIL BROWN: At first, Audrey
Calovich of Kansas City,
Missouri, only knew Flight
Officer

38:04.716 --> 38:10.455
Edmund Decker as a decorated
pilot killed by German fire on
June 8, 1944. She'd eventually

38:10.455 --> 38:13.291
find out much more.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.629
AUDREY CALOVICH: Ed possessed a
joy of mischief and adventure,
an eye for trouble, and a lover

38:17.629 --> 38:21.599
of life. He was dashing and
handsome. Flight Officer Decker
was idealistic, cocky and brave.

38:21.599 --> 38:25.036
He was a fighter
pilot, a good one.

38:25.036 --> 38:29.908
APRIL BROWN: Many of the details
Audrey discovered came from
Decker's family in Kansas city
and

38:29.908 --> 38:34.479
an alumni group at his old high
school. But she found few
military documents that
mentioned

38:34.479 --> 38:38.616
Decker, and that has given her
a new empathy for historians.

38:38.616 --> 38:43.121
AUDREY CALOVICH: Being on this
trip, you understand how
important it is to preserve
those documents

38:43.121 --> 38:45.723
for future researchers like us.

38:45.723 --> 38:48.693
APRIL BROWN: Audrey's history
teacher, Lisa Lauck, will use
lessons learned on this trip

38:48.693 --> 38:51.329
to change how she teaches.

38:51.329 --> 38:55.700
LISA LAUCK, Teacher: Looking at
it in the past, how I have
taught it, you think about

38:55.700 --> 38:59.437
the troop movements and the
overall big picture. And you
know people died, but you don't
really,

38:59.437 --> 39:01.906
I don't know, connect
to it emotionally.

39:01.906 --> 39:05.310
And that's something I really
want to change for my students.
So, I hope that they can

39:05.310 --> 39:13.751
take away that these are people
like you and I that had
families, had loved one.

39:13.751 --> 39:19.757
APRIL BROWN: While there is much
emphasis on the personal stories
here, historian Antonin

39:19.757 --> 39:23.595
Dehays is conveying another
important goal of the institute,
that the past can be seen

39:23.595 --> 39:26.397
in many ways.

39:26.397 --> 39:32.937
ANTONIN DEHAYS, Historian: Our
job is to mention all the
aspects of an event, the
glorious

39:32.937 --> 39:35.974
ones, but the darkest
ones as well.

39:35.974 --> 39:40.645
APRIL BROWN: Among them, the
horrors of the Holocaust and the
almost six million Jews

39:40.645 --> 39:46.050
who died. But at a visit to a
German cemetery, Nicole Cordes
of Indianapolis became aware

39:46.050 --> 39:49.487
of how families in that country
were affected as well.

39:49.487 --> 39:53.691
NICOLE CORDES, Student: Someone
had come recently and put a
laminated picture of a soldier,

39:53.691 --> 39:56.928
and they put flowers around it.
And they were fresh flowers. So,
I think he was 19 when

39:56.928 --> 39:58.896
he died.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.433
APRIL BROWN: Back at the
American cemetery, the students
say a final goodbye to the men

40:02.433 --> 40:04.736
they have grown to know.

40:04.736 --> 40:08.539
STUDENT: While Mack and I have
never met, I feel that this
experience has given me an

40:08.539 --> 40:13.544
opportunity to get to know a
face beyond the statistics. A
project that began as a way

40:13.544 --> 40:18.182
for me to share and teach
history has now instead been a
teacher to me.

40:18.182 --> 40:23.121
STUDENT: Eventually, time and
the elements will take back this
plot, but it is a beautiful

40:23.121 --> 40:26.457
thought to think that he will
stay here and that the earth
will always remember him and

40:26.457 --> 40:28.593
his sacrifice.

40:28.593 --> 40:32.964
APRIL BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm April Brown in
Normandy, France.

40:32.964 --> 40:37.869
GWEN IFILL: The students and
teachers are building Web sites
to share what they learned

40:37.869 --> 40:48.479
about their silent heroes. You
can find a link to them on our
home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

40:48.479 --> 41:00.758
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Fiat Chrysler
must offer to buy back hundreds
of thousands of Ram pickup

41:00.758 --> 41:05.463
trucks and other vehicles as
part of a settlement with the
federal government. The
automaker

41:05.463 --> 41:11.536
will also pay $105 million in
penalties, the highest civil
fine ever for an auto
manufacturer,

41:11.536 --> 41:14.138
as part of the agreement.

41:14.138 --> 41:20.311
The National Highway Safety
Traffic Administration, or NHTSA
for short, found 23 allegations
of

41:20.311 --> 41:26.317
misconduct with Fiat Chrysler,
covering more than 11 million
vehicles. The government said

41:26.317 --> 41:30.788
the company had failed to notify
owners and it had delayed fixing
vehicles, which included

41:30.788 --> 41:33.858
problems with
steering and control.

41:33.858 --> 41:39.964
Now, this comes just days after
a video showed hackers taking
over a Jeep, and Fiat ordered

41:39.964 --> 41:45.770
a voluntary recall of more than
one million cars in order to
prevent hacking.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.906
Anthony Foxx is the secretary of
transportation, and he joins me
now.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.042
Welcome again to the "NewsHour."

41:51.042 --> 41:52.944
ANTHONY FOXX, U.S. Secretary of
Transportation: Thank you, Judy.

41:52.944 --> 41:56.481
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, explain more
why this penalty is being
levied. What is it that Fiat
Chrysler

41:56.481 --> 41:58.950
failed to do?

41:58.950 --> 42:03.621
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, in the
course of doing recalls, the
recalls were basically
ineffective.

42:03.621 --> 42:08.993
And so there were failures to
notify dealers and consumers.
There was failure to inform

42:08.993 --> 42:15.133
NHTSA of various aspects of the
recall. And the recall was just
executed poorly. And so

42:15.133 --> 42:20.104
these fines are calibrated not
only to punish Fiat Chrysler,
but also we have remedial steps

42:20.104 --> 42:23.808
in place to help improve their
performance going forward.

42:23.808 --> 42:28.045
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's $105 million
in penalties, we mentioned. It
could have been much higher,

42:28.045 --> 42:33.317
though. I was reading today, if
you had levied, what, $35
million on each of the 23
recalls,

42:33.317 --> 42:36.254
it could have been $700
million or $800 million.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.890
ANTHONY FOXX: Look, this is a
significant penalty. It's the
highest penalty NHTSA has

42:38.890 --> 42:42.560
ever put in place
in its history.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.131
And I think it's a penalty that
will be attention-grabbing not
only to Fiat Chrysler, but also
to the

42:47.131 --> 42:51.769
rest of the industry. Our goal
is to see the industry be
proactive with safety and to
ensure

42:51.769 --> 42:56.040
that when consumers get behind
the wheel, they're able to move
where they're going safely.

42:56.040 --> 43:00.745
JUDY WOODRUFF: How significant
is it, Secretary Foxx, that Fiat
Chrysler is being asked -- or

43:00.745 --> 43:07.485
being ordered, in fact, to take
cars and trucks back that they
have sold? Is this designed

43:07.485 --> 43:10.755
to send a message to the
rest of the auto industry?

43:10.755 --> 43:15.460
ANTHONY FOXX: On that aspect of
the recall, we have found that,
in some cases, there is

43:15.460 --> 43:20.331
no effective remedy that
Chrysler has been able to
produce to solve the problem
consumers

43:20.331 --> 43:21.933
have.

43:21.933 --> 43:25.970
And so, in those cases, we're
having them buy those vehicles
back and of course get

43:25.970 --> 43:28.306
the consumer in a better car.

43:28.306 --> 43:29.574
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is the
first time something like that's
happened?

43:29.574 --> 43:29.874
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, this...

43:29.874 --> 43:30.675
(CROSSTALK)

43:30.675 --> 43:32.243
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of
this magnitude.

43:32.243 --> 43:36.781
ANTHONY FOXX: Yes, this
magnitude, perhaps. I haven't
gone back into the history books

43:36.781 --> 43:41.118
to look, but I know that it's a
rarely used authority, but it
does exist within NHTSA.

43:41.118 --> 43:45.923
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of a
safety risk is there right now
with Fiat Chrysler? I mentioned

43:45.923 --> 43:50.761
the recall on Friday over the
hacking. And then there was
another recall on Saturday.

43:50.761 --> 43:52.897
How many of their
vehicles are at risk?

43:52.897 --> 43:56.100
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, I think
there are sort of two separate
issues.

43:56.100 --> 44:02.707
The 23 recalls that we're making
the fines towards today, those
recalls, we think, are

44:02.707 --> 44:06.944
going to be much more effective,
given the remedial steps that
are being put in place.

44:06.944 --> 44:11.282
As far as cyber-security is
concerned, this is an ongoing
concern that we have. We are

44:11.282 --> 44:16.954
working with industry to produce
a roundtable with industry
stakeholders, all of whom have

44:16.954 --> 44:21.359
skin in the game when it comes
to cyber-security, so that we
can information across private

44:21.359 --> 44:24.629
sector holders, but also the
government is at the table
working with them to ensure that

44:24.629 --> 44:26.831
we're as safe as possible.

44:26.831 --> 44:30.167
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how should
the -- someone who is watching
-- there are so many car owners

44:30.167 --> 44:34.205
in this country, people who
drive cars and trucks. How
concerned should be people be?

44:34.205 --> 44:38.242
ANTHONY FOXX: Well, what you
should know is that we are not
only working with Fiat Chrysler

44:38.242 --> 44:43.981
to address the specific problem
that emerged last week, but
we're also working to ensure

44:43.981 --> 44:48.819
that, across the industry, there
is a much higher level of
vigilance around these
cyber-security

44:48.819 --> 44:51.289
issues. And there will
be more to come on that.

44:51.289 --> 44:57.094
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just on the
recalls overall, Secretary Foxx,
the sense is that NHTSA, the

44:57.094 --> 45:03.134
National Highway Safety Traffic
organization, is just taking a
much tougher line against

45:03.134 --> 45:05.570
the auto industry than has been
the case in the past. Is that
what -- how we should interpret

45:05.570 --> 45:07.405
this?

45:07.405 --> 45:12.643
ANTHONY FOXX: We believe very
firmly that, in this age of
rapidly changing technology

45:12.643 --> 45:16.614
and automakers trying to get
more and more products onto the
marketplace, that safety

45:16.614 --> 45:19.116
can't slip.

45:19.116 --> 45:25.089
And so we are being very
muscular, I would say, in terms
of responding to this
environment

45:25.089 --> 45:29.760
and making sure the industry
gets the appropriate signals
that, if they're proactive, it's
going

45:29.760 --> 45:33.164
to be a better business decision
to deal with these issues before
something gets on the

45:33.164 --> 45:37.034
street or to issue recalls, and
to do the right thing in the
first place.

45:37.034 --> 45:40.171
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me finally
ask you about something else
that is part of your portfolio,

45:40.171 --> 45:47.478
and that is a bill before
Congress to fund highways. How
worried are you that, now that

45:47.478 --> 45:54.218
we approach a deadline, the fact
is both houses of Congress are
not able to come together

45:54.218 --> 45:58.789
in some sort of an agreement on
this, and the fact that the
gasoline tax in this country

45:58.789 --> 46:02.727
no longer seems to be something
that Congress is willing to use
to fund the highway?

46:02.727 --> 46:06.330
ANTHONY FOXX: We have a
structural problem with how we
pay for our highways.

46:06.330 --> 46:12.036
And, you know, on the good side
of the ledger, it's good to see
both houses working towards

46:12.036 --> 46:17.141
what they believe are solutions
to solve the problem, even over,
you know, a multiyear

46:17.141 --> 46:22.713
period. But we have lots of
innings left in the week. I'm
hoping that they get to some

46:22.713 --> 46:26.817
resolution so that we don't go
over the highway cliff, because
there are projects across
country

46:26.817 --> 46:31.856
that would be potentially
stopped and jobs that would be
affected as well.

46:31.856 --> 46:35.359
Frankly, the country needs a
long-term highway bill. I have
been saying that the entire time

46:35.359 --> 46:37.695
I have been here, and we will
keep pressing, even if we go
into extra innings beyond this

46:37.695 --> 46:38.729
week.

46:38.729 --> 46:41.165
JUDY WOODRUFF: You think it
could go beyond this week?

46:41.165 --> 46:43.267
ANTHONY FOXX: Potentially. I'm
hoping they find a resolution,
but, you know, we have

46:43.267 --> 46:45.403
to see.

46:45.403 --> 46:49.807
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Anthony
Foxx, we thank you for joining
us.

46:49.807 --> 46:56.881
ANTHONY FOXX: Thank you.

46:56.881 --> 47:06.057
GWEN IFILL: "New York" magazine
overnight published an arresting
cover image that has

47:06.057 --> 47:11.395
brought renewed attention to the
dozens of sexual allegations
against Bill Cosby.

47:11.395 --> 47:17.068
Of the 46 women who have now
claimed rape or assault at the
comedian's hands, 35 agreed

47:17.068 --> 47:22.673
to be interviewed and
photographed. A 36th chair is
unoccupied, which sparked a
social

47:22.673 --> 47:29.747
media firestorm about the
assault victims who remain
silent. It's tagged
#TheEmptyChair.

47:29.747 --> 47:32.883
Here is one of the women who
did speak to the magazine.

47:32.883 --> 47:36.787
Joyce Emmons is a former comedy
club manager who said she was
assaulted by a friend of

47:36.787 --> 47:40.858
the comedian's one night after
she asked Cosby for headache
medication.

47:40.858 --> 47:47.398
JOYCE EMMONS, Accuser: And I
don't remember anything after
that, except waking up the

47:47.398 --> 47:56.874
next afternoon. I had no clothes
on. And his friend was there
next to me without clothes

47:56.874 --> 47:59.810
on.

47:59.810 --> 48:04.949
And I said, "What's -- what's
happening?" because I was really
out of it. And he said

48:04.949 --> 48:09.987
to me, "Did you enjoy yourself?"
as if I knew what I was doing.

48:09.987 --> 48:15.226
And I said, "You pig." And, of
course, I used some other words.
I said, "Bill, what did

48:15.226 --> 48:20.431
you give me?" I know it was a
little white pill. I remember
that much.

48:20.431 --> 48:25.035
And he said: "It's called a
quaalude. I bet you don't have
your headache now."

48:25.035 --> 48:28.906
And he laughed, as
if it were a joke.

48:28.906 --> 48:33.344
GWEN IFILL: Cosby has denied
allegations of rape and assault.
We contacted his spokesman

48:33.344 --> 48:37.615
again today, who declined to
comment on the latest report.

48:37.615 --> 48:40.351
Noreen Malone is a senior editor
at "New York" magazine who
interviewed and wrote many of

48:40.351 --> 48:43.154
the stories of the 35 women.

48:43.154 --> 48:45.189
Thank you for joining
us, Noreen Malone.

48:45.189 --> 48:48.659
How long has this project
been in the works?

48:48.659 --> 48:51.595
NOREEN MALONE, "New York": The
project has been under way since
December, actually, about

48:51.595 --> 48:55.099
six months.

48:55.099 --> 48:59.503
Our photo director at the
magazine had seen all the women
coming forward one by one. And

48:59.503 --> 49:02.973
she had the vision to see that,
if you put them all together in
one picture, how powerful

49:02.973 --> 49:04.642
that would be.

49:04.642 --> 49:08.646
GWEN IFILL: Did you have trouble
having them to agree? Did anyone
say no?

49:08.646 --> 49:14.451
NOREEN MALONE: People did say no
at first. One or two women
signed on, and then it
snowballed.

49:14.451 --> 49:18.656
We actually had people four
sign on in just the last week.

49:18.656 --> 49:22.960
I think, for many of these
women, they had already decided
to come forward. All of these

49:22.960 --> 49:26.497
women had already come forward.
So they had already made the
tough decision to go public.

49:26.497 --> 49:29.433
It was just a matter of sharing
even more with the public.

49:29.433 --> 49:33.537
GWEN IFILL: Well, not only was
there -- were there photographs
taken, not only did some

49:33.537 --> 49:37.441
of them agree to these videos,
but a lot of them met each other
for the first time. What

49:37.441 --> 49:39.710
was that like? Did you get to
spend some time at the photo
shoot to see how they interacted

49:39.710 --> 49:41.612
with one another?

49:41.612 --> 49:46.383
NOREEN MALONE: I did. I went by
the photo shoot in New York.

49:46.383 --> 49:52.957
And I think, for a lot of them,
it was weirdly a joyous
occasion. That seems like an odd

49:52.957 --> 49:58.195
word to use, but, you know, none
of them had met each other in
person before, and they

49:58.195 --> 50:02.600
were people who this was, you
know, a formative thing in their
lives, and these were the only

50:02.600 --> 50:06.203
people who could share
this experience with them.

50:06.203 --> 50:08.772
GWEN IFILL: Had these women been
blaming themselves all this
time? Is that the way that
works?

50:08.772 --> 50:12.343
NOREEN MALONE: They really had.

50:12.343 --> 50:16.313
Many of these incidents happened
in the '60s and '70s and even
the '80s, when date rape

50:16.313 --> 50:23.387
wasn't the same thing. There was
literally no word for that at
that time. And so these

50:23.387 --> 50:26.123
women had this experience that
they didn't even -- they
couldn't even make sense of
themselves,

50:26.123 --> 50:29.226
much less tell people about
it and have people listen.

50:29.226 --> 50:32.830
GWEN IFILL: In fact, if look at
the pictures, it's kind of
remarkable how many of them are

50:32.830 --> 50:37.001
of a certain age, in their 50s
and 60s now. So they all went
through this some time ago,

50:37.001 --> 50:39.003
allegedly.

50:39.003 --> 50:41.038
Separate interviews,
similar stories, however.

50:41.038 --> 50:45.643
NOREEN MALONE: Yes. That was
a really striking thing.

50:45.643 --> 50:51.415
You know, we talked to all 35
women separately, and the same
themes kept coming up. You know,

50:51.415 --> 50:54.585
many of the incidents that they
described, the alleged
incidents, are quite similar.

50:54.585 --> 51:02.192
They involve Cosby contacting an
agent and saying, you know, can
you put me in touch

51:02.192 --> 51:05.029
with someone? Many of these
girls were so excited. They were
models and actresses trying

51:05.029 --> 51:09.166
to make it and they heard that
Bill Cosby had taken an
interest.

51:09.166 --> 51:13.637
And then drugging a drink is a
real theme, unfortunately,
throughout these incidents.

51:13.637 --> 51:18.309
GWEN IFILL: I want to talk to
you about the empty chair.

51:18.309 --> 51:22.947
It's the thing that your eye is
drawn to after you look at these
women lined up and facing

51:22.947 --> 51:27.451
the camera. What is the
significance of it and -- first,
what's the significance of it?

51:27.451 --> 51:31.822
NOREEN MALONE: Well, I think
it's somewhat open to
interpretation.

51:31.822 --> 51:35.459
But as we were talking to many
of these women, almost all of
them said, oh, I know of someone

51:35.459 --> 51:38.329
else who -- she's not going to
come forward, she's not going to
talk, but it happened to

51:38.329 --> 51:42.132
her, too.

51:42.132 --> 51:46.637
And people on social media have
really seized on the empty chair
as a way of saying, OK,

51:46.637 --> 51:51.608
these 35 women are ready to talk
about something that happened in
their past, but not everyone

51:51.608 --> 51:57.614
who has been sexually assaulted
or raped is ready for that. And
so people were, you know,

51:57.614 --> 52:00.584
offering up reasons why women or
men might not be ready to come
forward and talk about

52:00.584 --> 52:02.653
it and hashtagging
it #TheEmptyChair.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.456
GWEN IFILL: In fact, one of the
interesting things, I thought,
in scrolling through some

52:05.456 --> 52:08.525
of the responses was, a lot of
it had nothing to do with Bill
Cosby at all.

52:08.525 --> 52:13.330
NOREEN MALONE: Mm-hmm. It really
took on a life of its own, which
was great to see.

52:13.330 --> 52:17.234
GWEN IFILL: Have you -- we have
not, but have you gotten any
reaction from the Cosby camp

52:17.234 --> 52:20.270
on this latest report?

52:20.270 --> 52:24.441
NOREEN MALONE: I have not. And
we reached out before
publication to several of his
lawyers,

52:24.441 --> 52:26.677
and we have not
heard back at all.

52:26.677 --> 52:30.247
GWEN IFILL: So, did you
anticipate any of this reaction?
Did you anticipate that there

52:30.247 --> 52:35.753
might be legal pushback? How did
you, I guess, vet all of these
stories?

52:35.753 --> 52:39.690
NOREEN MALONE: Well, it
was quite a process.

52:39.690 --> 52:46.096
The magazine has a fact-checking
process, but, you know, we don't
-- all of the stories

52:46.096 --> 52:50.267
are, we say, alleged in this. We
check them out to the best of
our ability, but, again,

52:50.267 --> 52:57.307
at the end of the day, it's he
said/she said. Cosby has not
been convicted of any crimes.

52:57.307 --> 53:02.446
The statute of limitation is up
for all of these incidents. So
our focus was really more

53:02.446 --> 53:05.649
in letting these women
tell their stories.

53:05.649 --> 53:09.853
GWEN IFILL: In this case, it was
he said, she said, she said, she
said, and so on.

53:09.853 --> 53:10.888
NOREEN MALONE: Right.

53:10.888 --> 53:13.624
GWEN IFILL: Noreen Malone of
"New York" magazine, thank you
very much.

53:13.624 --> 53:21.698
NOREEN MALONE: Thank you.

53:21.698 --> 53:29.740
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: We continue our series
on long-term care with

53:29.740 --> 53:35.712
three profiles of older
Americans who have decided to
age in place, that is, to stay

53:35.712 --> 53:39.750
in their homes, rather then move
to nursing facilities. See how
they do it. We have their

53:39.750 --> 53:42.152
stories on our home
page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:42.152 --> 53:47.057
GWEN IFILL: And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:47.057 --> 53:50.461
On Tuesday: how the first test
of the atomic bomb changed the
lives of those living downwind

53:50.461 --> 53:51.428
from the blast.

53:51.428 --> 53:52.763
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:52.763 --> 53:55.032
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:55.032 --> 53:58.735
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:58.735 --> 53:59.036
thank you, and good night.
