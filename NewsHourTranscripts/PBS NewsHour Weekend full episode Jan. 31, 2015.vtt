ISRAEL HAS WITHHELD THE PAYMENT

PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT'S

01:42.336 --> 01:43.503
DECISION TO TRY TO JOIN THE

01:44.538 --> 01:45.973
TRY TO PROSECUTE ISRAEL FOR

NETANYAHU SAID TODAY ISRAEL

01:49.042 --> 01:50.110

PROSECUTE ITS SOLDIERS.

AUTHORITY WHO ENTERED AN

02:06.593 --> 02:07.928
ALLIANCE WITH THE HAMAS WAR

CRIMINALS.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.397
I.D.F. SOLDIERS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:10.397 --> 02:11.698
DEFEND THE STATE OF ISRAEL WITH

02:11.698 --> 02:13.200
DETERMINATION AND MIGHT.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.401
JUST AS THEY DEFEND US, WE WILL

02:14.401 --> 02:15.936
DEFEND THEM WITH THE SAME

02:15.936 --> 02:17.170
DETERMINATION AND THE SAME

02:29.416 --> 02:30.751
OF THE PONTIFF'S EFFORTS TO

02:30.751 --> 02:31.952
DIVERSIFY THE CHURCH HIERARCHY.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.320
OBSERVERS SAY TODAY'S DECISION

02:33.320 --> 02:34.654
MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE

02:34.654 --> 02:35.856
NEXT POPE WILL BE FROM SOME PART

02:35.856 --> 02:37.657
OF THE WORLD OTHER THAN EUROPE.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.860
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, THOUSANDS

02:39.860 --> 02:41.395

02:55.642 --> 02:56.910
THOUGH POLICE COMMISSIONER

02:56.910 --> 02:57.778
WILLIAM BRATTON HAD WARNED THEM

02:57.778 --> 02:58.745
NOT TO.

02:58.745 --> 02:59.813
SOME ACCUSE THE MAYOR OF

02:59.813 --> 03:00.981

03:11.825 --> 03:14.327
FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE ECONOMY.

03:14.327 --> 03:15.595
>> WELL, I THINK JOBS AND THE

03:15.595 --> 03:16.797
ECONOMY ARE CLEARLY WHAT THE

03:16.797 --> 03:18.799
VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.167
WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

03:20.167 --> 03:23.070
TO TRY TO REIN IN THE REGULATORY

03:23.070 --> 03:24.504
ONSLAUGHT, WHICH IS THE

03:24.504 --> 03:26.139
PRINCIPAL REASON THAT WE HAVEN'T

03:26.139 --> 03:27.541
HAD THE KIND OF BOUNCE BACK

03:27.541 --> 03:29.576
AFTER THE 2008 RECESSION THAT

03:29.576 --> 03:32.379

03:47.360 --> 03:48.762
TO BROADCASTING.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.497
PRESIDENT OBAMA, A FAN OF THE

04:25.932 --> 04:27.200
SEE IN THE SENATE WHERE

04:27.200 --> 04:28.902
THESE BIG CHANGES ARE

04:28.902 --> 04:29.870
HAPPENING, OBVIOUSLY WITH

04:29.870 --> 04:31.638
THE PARTY CONTROL SWITCH

04:31.638 --> 04:34.074
MOST PARTICULARLY IS WE'RE

04:34.074 --> 04:35.442
GOING TO SEE THE REPUBLICANS

04:35.442 --> 04:37.410
GET RIGHT DOWN TO ONE OF THE

04:37.410 --> 04:38.578
AGENDA ITEMS THAT THEY'VE

04:38.578 --> 04:40.981
HAD ON-LINE FOR A LONG TIME.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.850
AND THAT'S APPROVING THAT

04:43.850 --> 04:46.486
KEYSTONE XL PIPE-LINE FROM

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY OF

04:54.227 --> 04:54.928
THIS WEEK.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.296
AND SO BY THE END OF THE

04:56.296 --> 04:58.031
WEEK, THAT BILL SHOULD BE

04:58.031 --> 04:59.499
OUT OF THE COMMITTEE AN BE

04:59.499 --> 05:00.500
WELL ON ITS WAY TO THE

05:00.500 --> 05:00.934
FLOOR.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.136
NOW OF COURSE AS YOU NOTED

ALASKA IS THE REPUBLICAN WHO

WILL BE THE CHAIRWOMAN OF

05:10.343 --> 05:11.111
THAT PANEL EL.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.145
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT

05:12.145 --> 05:13.146
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.516
AND WE'LL SEE IT NOT JUST ON

05:16.516 --> 05:17.651
LEGISLATIVE ISSUES, BUT

05:17.651 --> 05:19.519
WE'LL START TO SEE A LOT

05:19.519 --> 05:21.655
MORE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AS

05:21.655 --> 05:23.757
WELL IN WAYS THAT MAYBE THE

05:23.757 --> 05:24.658
ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT

05:24.658 --> 05:25.525
LIKE TO SEE.

05:25.525 --> 05:26.893
IF YOU ARE THE WHITE HOUSE,

05:26.893 --> 05:28.428
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE

05:28.428 --> 05:30.297
ON THE HILL ALL THE TIME TO

05:30.297 --> 05:32.399
CONSIDER THINGS.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.133
>> Sreenivasan: SO DOES THIS

05:33.133 --> 05:34.534
SET UP A VETO TEST FOR THE

05:34.534 --> 05:35.135
PRESIDENT?

05:35.135 --> 05:37.003
WHETHER IT'S KEYSTONE OR

05:37.003 --> 05:38.205
OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION

05:38.205 --> 05:39.606
WHERE IT'S ALMOST A KIND OF

05:39.606 --> 05:41.308
STRATEGIC TRAP IF LET'S SAY

05:41.308 --> 05:42.609
REPUBLICANS CAN GET LOTS OF

05:42.609 --> 05:44.044
LEGISLATION PASSED, GET IT

05:44.044 --> 05:45.145
TO THE WHITE HOUSE'S DOOR

05:45.145 --> 05:46.780
AND SAY LOOK, HERE'S THE GUY

05:46.780 --> 05:47.781
THAT IS THE OBSTRUCTIONIST,

05:47.781 --> 05:49.216
HERE IS THE GUY USING HIS

05:49.216 --> 05:50.584
VETO POWER AND NOT GETTING

05:50.584 --> 05:51.551
ANYTHING DONE IN WASHINGTON

05:51.551 --> 05:51.885
SM.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.119
>> ABSOLUTELY.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.654
THE TEST, KEYSTONE WILL BE

05:54.654 --> 05:55.322
THE FIRST TEST.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.124
I THINK EVERYONE SORT OF

05:58.124 --> 05:59.593
EXPECTING THAT THE PRESIDENT

05:59.593 --> 06:01.695
WOULD, IN FACT, VETO THAT

06:01.695 --> 06:02.562
ITEM.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.931
THE TEST REALLY WILL BE HOW

06:04.931 --> 06:07.467
FAR CAN THE REPUBLICANS GO

06:07.467 --> 06:10.203
DOWN THE ROAD OF SENDING

06:10.203 --> 06:12.172
THINGS TO THE PRESIDENT THAT

06:12.172 --> 06:14.507
HE'S GOING TO VETO, GIVEN

06:14.507 --> 06:16.042
THE FACT THAT THERE'S STILL

06:16.042 --> 06:18.678
THE 60 VOTE REQUIREMENT TO

06:18.678 --> 06:20.180
OVERCOME A POTENTIAL

06:20.180 --> 06:21.381
FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.415
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DO

06:22.415 --> 06:24.851
THINGS THAT ARE TOO AGAINST

06:24.851 --> 06:26.553
WHAT THE WISHES OF THE

06:26.553 --> 06:27.921
PRESIDENT, THAT YOU'RE NOT

06:27.921 --> 06:29.956
GOING TOO GET THE HANDFUL OF

06:29.956 --> 06:30.991
DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD BE

06:30.991 --> 06:32.525
NEEDED TO OVERCOME THOSE

06:32.525 --> 06:33.760
PROCEDURAL BARRIERS.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.729
SO THERE SORT OF IS THIS

06:35.729 --> 06:36.429
BALANCING ACT.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.864
WHAT IS THE SWEET SPOT WHERE

06:37.864 --> 06:40.567
YOU CAN FIND FIVE OR TEN

06:40.567 --> 06:41.935
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE TO

06:41.935 --> 06:43.303
GO ALONG WITH SOMETHING THAT

06:43.303 --> 06:44.371
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND

06:44.371 --> 06:45.739
SENATE REPUBLICANS WANT TO

06:45.739 --> 06:47.107
DO AND CAUSE A TOUGH

06:47.107 --> 06:48.541
DECISION FOR THE PRESIDENT.

06:48.541 --> 06:49.209
>> Sreenivasan : WELL, WHAT

06:49.209 --> 06:50.443
ABOUT THINGS LIKE

06:50.443 --> 06:51.211
IMMIGRATION OR THE

06:51.211 --> 06:52.212
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.913
IS THERE SOME GIVE-AND-TAKE

06:53.913 --> 06:55.248
THAT COULD BE HAPPENING?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.683
>> WELL, I THINK

06:56.683 --> 06:57.651
PARTICULARLY ON THE HEALTH

06:57.651 --> 07:00.020
CARE LAW, THAT'S A PERFECT

07:00.020 --> 07:02.022
EXAMPLE OF WHAT I WAS JUST

07:02.022 --> 07:03.223
REFERRING TO BECAUSE WHAT

07:03.223 --> 07:06.960
YOU'LL SEE IS VOTES THAT

07:06.960 --> 07:09.963
EVERYONE KNOWS ARE DOOMED ON

07:09.963 --> 07:12.732
REPEALING THE ACA OUTRIGHT.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.501
BUT THEN YOU'LL ALSO SEE

07:14.501 --> 07:16.536
WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE TERMED

07:16.536 --> 07:19.539
LITTLE RIFLE SHOT TYPE

07:19.539 --> 07:20.573
MEASURES WHERE THERE ARE

07:20.573 --> 07:21.975
PROVISION OF THE HEALTH CARE

07:21.975 --> 07:24.044
LAW THAT HAVE BROAD

07:24.044 --> 07:27.747
OPPOSITION LIKE AN EXCISE

07:27.747 --> 07:29.449
TAX ON MEDICAL DEVICE

07:29.449 --> 07:30.550
MANUFACTURERS, THAT PROBABLY

07:30.550 --> 07:32.252
IF YOU PUT IT UP FOR A VOTE

07:32.252 --> 07:33.586
IN THE SENATE COULD GET

07:33.586 --> 07:34.721
MAYBE 70 VOTES.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.922
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE

07:35.922 --> 07:36.589
NUMBERS.

07:36.589 --> 07:37.624
I HAVEN'T COUNTED WITH THE

07:37.624 --> 07:38.358
NEW SENATE.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.592
BUT IT DID GET AN OVERWHELMING

07:39.592 --> 07:40.393
MAJORITY.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.095
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

07:42.095 --> 07:43.797
THAT COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE A

07:43.797 --> 07:44.898
TOUGH TEST FOR ITS PRESIDENT

07:44.898 --> 07:45.899
BECAUSE IT WOULD ACTUALLY

07:45.899 --> 07:47.901
GET DOWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.568
>> Sreenivasan : AN THIS

07:48.568 --> 07:49.936
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM

07:49.936 --> 07:51.204
THERE IS STILL KIND OF IN

07:51.204 --> 07:52.138
THE LOOMING PROSPECTS OF

07:52.138 --> 07:53.006
2016.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.274
THERE ARE SENATORS AN

07:54.274 --> 07:55.342
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE,

07:55.342 --> 07:56.710
PERHAPS THAT ARE POSTURING

07:56.710 --> 07:57.744
AND POSITIONING THEMSELVES

07:57.744 --> 07:59.112
TO MAKE A RUN FOR IT, SO

07:59.112 --> 08:00.080
THIS IS REALLY THE

08:00.080 --> 08:01.014
REPUBLICAN'S OPPORTUNITY TO

08:01.014 --> 08:02.315
SHOW OFF WHAT THEY CAN DO

08:02.315 --> 08:04.084
AND HOW THEY CAN GOVERN WHEN

08:04.084 --> 08:05.085
THEY DO HAVE CONGRESS,

08:05.085 --> 08:05.685
RIGHT?

08:05.685 --> 08:06.453
>> RIGHT.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.887
AND SO WHAT WE SEE WHICH

08:07.887 --> 08:09.856
WILL BE A BIT OF A TEST AS

08:09.856 --> 08:11.725
WELL, IF YOU ARE THE

08:11.725 --> 08:13.293
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE

08:13.293 --> 08:15.895
SENATE, PARTICULARLY, IS

08:15.895 --> 08:18.365
DEALING WITH THE NUMBER OF

08:18.365 --> 08:22.001
YOUR MEMBERS WHO MIGHT BE

08:22.001 --> 08:23.703
POSTURING OR THINKING ABOUT

08:23.703 --> 08:25.205
SERIOUSLY RUNNING FOR

08:25.205 --> 08:25.839
PRESIDENT.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.309
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

08:29.309 --> 08:30.977
POLITICAL INTERESTS AND THE

08:30.977 --> 08:33.213
NEED TO GET ATTENTION WILL

08:33.213 --> 08:36.449
NOT ALIGN WITH TRYING TO GET

08:36.449 --> 08:38.818
ACTUAL LEGISLATION ON THE

08:38.818 --> 08:39.552
PRESIDENT'S DESK.

08:39.552 --> 08:40.954
YOU CAN SEE SITUATIONS WHERE

08:40.954 --> 08:42.956
A SENATOR WHO IS RUNNING FOR

08:42.956 --> 08:46.025
PRESIDENT SORT OF SEIZES THE

08:46.025 --> 08:47.961
SENATE FLOOR AND SORT OF

08:47.961 --> 08:49.763
TRIES TO

08:49.763 --> 08:50.330
ATTRACTION-- ATTRACT

08:50.330 --> 08:51.798
ATTENTION IN A WAY THAT IS

08:51.798 --> 08:53.166
NOT WHAT SENATOR McCONNELL

08:53.166 --> 08:54.868
OR THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

08:54.868 --> 08:55.535
WOULD WANT.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.970
AND THAT WILL BE ANOTHER

08:56.970 --> 08:58.605
BALANCING ACT THAT WE'LL SEE

08:58.605 --> 09:00.306
GOING INTO THE NEXT YEAR OR

09:00.306 --> 09:02.842
SO BEFORE PEOPLE START

09:02.842 --> 09:04.611
REALLY HEADING IN

09:04.611 --> 09:05.445
EARNEST-- I KNOW THEY HAVE

09:05.445 --> 09:06.980
ALREADY GONE SOME, BUT

09:06.980 --> 09:07.680
BEFORE HEADING INTO EARN

09:07.680 --> 09:09.115
TOAST IOWA AND NEW

09:09.115 --> 09:10.049
HAMPSHIRE.

09:10.049 --> 09:14.387
>> ALL RIGHT, NIELS

09:14.387 --> 09:16.656
LESNIEWSKI FROM ROLL CALL,

09:16.656 --> 09:17.190
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

09:17.190 --> 09:23.763
>> THANK YOU.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.231
>> Sreenivasan: AS WE ALREADY

09:25.231 --> 09:26.366
REPORTED THOUSANDS OF POLICE

09:26.366 --> 09:27.367
OFFICERS TURNED OUT TODAY FOR

09:27.367 --> 09:28.635
THE FUNERAL OF SLAIN NEW YORK

09:28.635 --> 09:30.003
CITY POLICEMAN, WENJIAN LIU.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.271
THE MURDER OF OFFICER LIU AND

09:31.271 --> 09:32.439
OFFICER RAFAEL RAMOS CAME AFTER

09:32.439 --> 09:35.408
WEEKS OF NATIONWIDE PROTESTS

09:35.408 --> 09:36.609
AGAINST POLICE.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.211
FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR

09:38.211 --> 09:39.379
RUDOLPH GIULIANI HAS SAID THOSE

09:39.379 --> 09:40.113
DEMONSTRATIONS CREATED AN ANTI-

09:40.113 --> 09:41.014
POLICE ENVIRONMENT.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.182
>> I DON'T THINK IT GOES TOO FAR

09:42.182 --> 09:44.684
TO SAY THE MAYOR DID NOT

09:44.684 --> 09:45.919
PROPERLY POLICE THE PROTESTS.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.387
HE ALLOWED THE PROTESTORS TO

09:47.387 --> 09:48.588
TAKE OVER THE STREETS.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.856
HE ALLOWED THEM TO HURT THE

09:49.856 --> 09:50.957
POLICE OFFICERS TO COMMIT CRIMES

09:50.957 --> 09:52.425
AND THEY DIDN'T ARREST THEM.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.027
THE PSYCHOLOGICALLY TROUBLED

09:54.027 --> 09:55.862
GUNMAN WHO MURDERED THE TWO NEW

09:55.862 --> 09:57.330
YORK CITY OFFICERS HAD MENTIONED

09:57.330 --> 09:58.598
THE POLICE KILLINGS OF MICHAEL

09:58.598 --> 10:00.033
BROWN AND ERIC GARNER IN A

10:00.033 --> 10:01.234
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING BEFORE HE

10:01.234 --> 10:02.502
AMBUSHED AND KILLED LIU AND

10:02.502 --> 10:04.971
RAMOS.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.773
HERE TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT

10:06.773 --> 10:08.041
RELATIONS BETWEEN POLICE AND

10:08.041 --> 10:09.642
MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE L. JOY

10:09.642 --> 10:10.910
WILLIAMS, PRESIDENT OF THE

10:10.910 --> 10:12.245
BROOKLYN CHAPTER OF THE

10:12.245 --> 10:13.346
N.A.A.C.P.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.347
AND JULIAN HARPER, HE IS A

10:14.347 --> 10:15.348
RETIRED NEW YORK CITY POLICE

10:15.348 --> 10:16.683
LIEUTENANT AND WITH THE

10:16.683 --> 10:17.884
ORGANIZATION, 100 BLACKS IN LAW

10:17.884 --> 10:21.888
ENFORCEMENT WHO CARE.

10:21.888 --> 10:22.889
SO THROUGHOUT THIS WE SAW

10:22.889 --> 10:23.923
DEMONSTRATIONS NOT JUST IN

10:23.923 --> 10:25.358
NEW YORK CITY BUT AROUND THE

10:25.358 --> 10:25.992
NATION.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.694
AND YOU SAW PROTESTORS

10:27.694 --> 10:29.062
HOLDING UP THE SIGN THAT

10:29.062 --> 10:30.430
SAID, BLACK LIVES MATTER.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.065
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.167
>> THE BLACK LIVES MATTER

10:34.167 --> 10:35.268
FOCUS AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE

10:35.268 --> 10:37.070
THAT ARE DOING THAT ARE

10:37.070 --> 10:38.404
TRYING TO RAISE ATTENTION

10:38.404 --> 10:42.375
THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO US

10:42.375 --> 10:43.743
MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ANYONE,

10:43.743 --> 10:44.777
ANY OTHER COMMUNITIES.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.514
AND THEN WHY IS IT THAT IN

10:47.514 --> 10:48.515
OTHER COMMUNITIES THEY CAN

10:48.515 --> 10:49.616
HAVE POLICING THAT DOES NOT

10:49.616 --> 10:50.917
RESULT IN THE KILLING OF

10:50.917 --> 10:51.584
UNARMED PEOPLE.

10:51.584 --> 10:55.388
LET ME SAY ALSO, YOU KNOW,

10:55.388 --> 10:56.756
FROM A GENERAL PERSPECTIVE,

10:56.756 --> 10:58.124
EVERYONE IS MAKING THE

10:58.124 --> 10:59.058
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

10:59.058 --> 11:00.560
PROTESTS AND THE TRAGIC

11:00.560 --> 11:03.663
DEATH OF A POLICE OFFICER,

11:03.663 --> 11:04.697
BUT THERE IS NO DIRECT

11:04.697 --> 11:05.498
CONNECTION.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.700
IT IS NOT PROTESTORS THAT

11:07.700 --> 11:09.102
WENT OUT AND SORT OF

11:09.102 --> 11:11.471
COMMITTED THIS CRIME.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.472
WE ALREADY KNOW WHO

11:12.472 --> 11:13.506
COMMITTED THE CRIME.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.210
AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO

11:17.210 --> 11:18.278
MOURN ALL DEATHS AND THAT IS

11:18.278 --> 11:19.712
CERTAINLY WHAT WE ARE DOING

11:19.712 --> 11:21.014
BOTH FOR THE OFFICERS AND

11:21.014 --> 11:22.081
UNARMED MEN BEING KILLED BY

11:22.081 --> 11:22.715
POLICE OFFICERS.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.150
>> NOW THE NYPD WILL SAY

11:24.150 --> 11:25.518
LISS ONLY, WE HAVE ONE OF

11:25.518 --> 11:26.586
THE MOST DIVERSE POLICE

11:26.586 --> 11:27.554
DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY,

11:27.554 --> 11:29.255
IN ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE

11:29.255 --> 11:30.023
CITIES ON THE PLANET.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.958
IS IT DIFFERENT FOR

11:31.958 --> 11:32.725
AFRICAN-AMERICAN POLICE

11:32.725 --> 11:34.494
OFFICERS AND HOW THEY TREAT

11:34.494 --> 11:35.828
YOUNG BLACK MEN OR

11:35.828 --> 11:36.796
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU

11:36.796 --> 11:38.164
ARE BLACK, WHITE, BROWN, YOU

11:38.164 --> 11:39.866
BECOME BLUE ONCE PUT THE

11:39.866 --> 11:40.500
UNIFORM ON?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.968
>> WELL, I THINK IT DEPENDS

11:41.968 --> 11:42.902
ON THE INDIVIDUAL.

11:42.902 --> 11:43.670
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY

11:43.670 --> 11:45.004
OFFICERS THAT ARE OF COLOR

11:45.004 --> 11:46.639
THAT STILL HAVE THAT SAME

11:46.639 --> 11:48.408
MIND-SET OF US AGAINST THEM.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.143
SO WHEN THEY RESPOND TO

11:50.143 --> 11:50.977
CERTAIN JOBS, WHEN THEY

11:50.977 --> 11:51.811
RESPOND IN CERTAIN

11:51.811 --> 11:52.779
COMMUNITIES, THEY STILL HAVE

11:52.779 --> 11:54.480
THIS VERY HEAVY-HANDED WAY

11:54.480 --> 11:56.849
OF ENFORCING, SO WHEN YOU

11:56.849 --> 11:58.184
START TRYING TO DETERMINE

11:58.184 --> 12:01.721
WHETHER IT'S A OFFICER

12:01.721 --> 12:02.522
THAT'S WHITE OR OFFICER THAT

12:02.522 --> 12:04.123
IS BLACK OR HISPANIC,

12:04.123 --> 12:05.124
SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE

12:05.124 --> 12:05.525
PROBLEM.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.559
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS

12:06.559 --> 12:07.860
A MIND-SET AND THAT IS WHY

12:07.860 --> 12:08.895
THESE PROBLEM OCCUR.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.830
>> WE KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES

12:10.830 --> 12:13.566
OF COLOR ARE OVERPOLICED,

12:13.566 --> 12:14.968
WE KNOW THAT MEN OF COLOR

12:14.968 --> 12:17.003
ARE OVERARRESTED, OVERCHARGED.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.037
WE KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS

12:18.037 --> 12:19.739
TO BE TRUE.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.107
AND SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE A

12:21.107 --> 12:22.809
LONG ROAD AND A LOT OF

12:22.809 --> 12:24.010
POLICY CHANGES AND MIND-SET

12:24.010 --> 12:24.844
CHANGES.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.046
AND THAT'S REALLY THE HARD

12:27.046 --> 12:27.947
WORK.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.248
IT'S CHANGING PEOPLE'S

12:29.248 --> 12:29.782
MIND-SET.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.351
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE

12:31.351 --> 12:32.452
MAJORITY OF OFFICERS WHO ARE

12:32.452 --> 12:33.820
GOING TO THEIR JOB EVERY DAY

12:33.820 --> 12:35.555
ARE GOING, THEY HAVE A

12:35.555 --> 12:36.289
COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY,

12:36.289 --> 12:39.258
TO THE CITY, TO THE JOB AND

12:39.258 --> 12:40.627
DO THEIR UNIFORM AND WANT TO

12:40.627 --> 12:41.728
GO AND DO THE BEST JOB AND

12:41.728 --> 12:43.696
MAKE IT HOME SAFELY TO THEIR

12:43.696 --> 12:44.097
FAMILIES.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.598
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THAT IS

12:45.598 --> 12:46.199
THE TRUTH.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.900
HOWEVER, THESE SMALL BIASES,

12:47.900 --> 12:48.935
THESE SMALL PREJUDICES,

12:48.935 --> 12:50.737
THINGS THAT PEOPLE LEAVE

12:50.737 --> 12:51.938
ACTUALLY HAS AN IMPACT ON

12:51.938 --> 12:52.905
HOW THEY SERVE THE

12:52.905 --> 12:53.740
COMMUNITY.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.675
AND SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

12:55.675 --> 12:57.343
THAT WE WANT THE POLICE

12:57.343 --> 12:59.078
DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO

12:59.078 --> 13:01.214
POLICE ALL COMMUNITIES

13:01.214 --> 13:01.981
INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF

13:01.981 --> 13:04.283
COLOR WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF

13:04.283 --> 13:05.652
RESPECT, WITH THE SAME EVEN

13:05.652 --> 13:07.020
HAND THAT THEY DO EVERY

13:07.020 --> 13:07.687
OTHER COMMUNITY.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.390
AND THAT'S NOT ANTI-POLICE.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.691
>> SO WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL

13:11.691 --> 13:14.127
OVERPOLICING, THE NYPD SAYS

13:14.127 --> 13:15.161
IS EFFECTIVE POLICING.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.162
THEY WILL PULL OUT THE CRIME

13:16.162 --> 13:17.196
STATISTICS AND SAY LOOK, WE

13:17.196 --> 13:18.631
ARE GETTING SAFER AND SAFER

13:18.631 --> 13:19.599
AS A CITY.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.933
AND ISN'T THAT ACTUALLY

13:20.933 --> 13:21.701
BETTER FOR COMMUNITIES OF

13:21.701 --> 13:23.670
COLOR WHO MIGHT BE

13:23.670 --> 13:24.404
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED

13:24.404 --> 13:26.439
BY THESE SAME CRIME NUMBERS.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.440
>> DEFINITELY WE HAVE SEEN A

13:27.440 --> 13:28.808
DECLINE IN MURDERS.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.443
BUT TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LAW

13:30.443 --> 13:31.611
ENFORCEMENT, YOU HAVE TO

13:31.611 --> 13:32.912
HAVE THE TRUST AND

13:32.912 --> 13:33.680
COMMITMENT AND COOPERATION

13:33.680 --> 13:34.614
OF THE COMMUNITY.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.649
AND SO IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT

13:36.649 --> 13:37.383
EFFECTIVELY F THE COMMUNITY

13:37.383 --> 13:39.752
DOES NOT HAVE TRUST IN YOU,

13:39.752 --> 13:42.055
LISTEN, I'VE HAD INSTANCES,

13:42.055 --> 13:44.123
JUST IN THIS PAST YEAR WHERE

13:44.123 --> 13:46.292
I HAVE HAD A GRANDMOTHER

13:46.292 --> 13:48.361
CALL N.A.A.C.P. OFFICE WITH

13:48.361 --> 13:50.363
HER YOUNG GRANDSON THAT SHE

13:50.363 --> 13:51.764
TAKES CARE OF AT 14 YEARS

13:51.764 --> 13:53.299
OLD, AND THAT A LOCAL GANG

13:53.299 --> 13:54.901
IS MAKING HIM KEEP GUNS IN

13:54.901 --> 13:55.902
HER HOUSE.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.870
SHE DOES NOT FEEL

13:57.870 --> 13:58.905
COMFORTABLE CALLING THE

13:58.905 --> 13:59.639
POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE

13:59.639 --> 14:01.074
SHE DOESN'T TRUST THEM.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.109
AND SHE'S ALSO AFRAID OF THE

14:03.109 --> 14:04.877
GANGS THAT ARE IN THE

14:04.877 --> 14:05.478
STREET.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.180
WHAT KIND OF PREDICAMENT

14:07.180 --> 14:08.881
DOES THAT PUT HER IN TO BE

14:08.881 --> 14:10.650
ABLE TO NOT ONLY SAVE HER

14:10.650 --> 14:12.652
GRANDSON, BUT ALSO PROTECT

14:12.652 --> 14:14.320
HER LIFE.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.354
>> THIS BRINGS UP THE

14:15.354 --> 14:16.656
CONVERSATION, RIGHT T WAS

14:16.656 --> 14:17.790
VERY INTERESTING THE DAY

14:17.790 --> 14:19.092
THAT THE GRAND JURY REFUSED

14:19.092 --> 14:20.660
TO PRESS CHARGES AGAINST THE

14:20.660 --> 14:21.794
OFFICER WHO HAD THE

14:21.794 --> 14:23.229
CHOKEHOLD ON ERIC GARNER,

14:23.229 --> 14:24.197
WAS A PART OF THE PRESS

14:24.197 --> 14:25.164
CONFERENCE THAT THE MAYOR

14:25.164 --> 14:26.532
HAD.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.334
WHERE HE BASICALLY MENTIONED

14:28.334 --> 14:29.836
A CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD

14:29.836 --> 14:32.338
AT SOME POINT WITH HIS

14:32.338 --> 14:33.005
BIRACIAL SON.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.407
>> WE HAVE HAD TO LITERALLY

14:34.407 --> 14:36.476
TRAIN HIM AS FAMILIES HAVE

14:36.476 --> 14:38.177
ALL OVER THIS CITY FOR

14:38.177 --> 14:40.313
DECADES, IN HOW TO TAKE

14:40.313 --> 14:43.015
SPECIAL CARE IN ANY

14:43.015 --> 14:44.050
ENCOUNTER HE HAS WITH THE

14:44.050 --> 14:45.051
POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE

14:45.051 --> 14:46.886
THERE TO PROTECT HIM.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.854
>> WHEN YOU WERE A POLICE

14:47.854 --> 14:49.122
OFFICER, EVEN NOW, DID YOU

14:49.122 --> 14:50.323
HAVE TO HAVE THAT

14:50.323 --> 14:51.424
CONVERSATION IN YOUR FAMILY?

14:51.424 --> 14:55.094
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.963
AFTER THE ERIC GARNER

14:56.963 --> 14:58.664
INCIDENT, MY SON CALLS ME

14:58.664 --> 15:01.134
AND HE SAYS DAD, HE SAYS I'M

15:01.134 --> 15:02.135
AFRAID.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.870
HE SAYS IT'S AGAINST THE LAW

15:03.870 --> 15:05.571
TO BE A LARGE BLACK MAN.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.340
AND MY SON IS A RATHER LARGE

15:07.340 --> 15:07.974
MAN.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.308
AND I MEAN THAT REALLY,

15:09.308 --> 15:10.009
REALLY BOTHERED ME.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.711
I HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

15:11.711 --> 15:12.745
MY SON'S SAFETY.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.947
AND I HAVE TO BE CONCERNED

15:14.947 --> 15:16.849
ABOUT HIS PERCEPTION OF HIM

15:16.849 --> 15:18.384
BEING A LARGE BLACK MAN.

15:18.384 --> 15:19.919
AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO

15:19.919 --> 15:20.953
HAVE THESE CONVERSATION.

15:20.953 --> 15:21.988
NOW SI HAVE A YOUNGER SON

15:21.988 --> 15:24.023
THAT IS 13 YEARS OLD THAT IS

15:24.023 --> 15:26.058
A PRETTY BIG 13-YEAR-OLD.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.760
AND HE'S VERY INNOCENT

15:27.760 --> 15:28.094
CHILD.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.796
SO HE WOULDN'T EVEN

15:29.796 --> 15:30.863
UNDERSTAND AN INTERACTION

15:30.863 --> 15:31.898
BETWEEN HIM AND THE POLICE.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.733
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT HIS

15:33.733 --> 15:35.034
FATHER IS A POLICE, HE

15:35.034 --> 15:36.402
UNDERSTOOD STANDS HE HAS

15:36.402 --> 15:38.504
TAKEN PHOTOS AS A CHILD IN

15:38.504 --> 15:39.539
HER FATHER'S UNIFORM AND HE

15:39.539 --> 15:40.540
WAS PROUD OF THAT.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.574
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY

15:41.574 --> 15:43.543
THAT POLICE RESPOND AND

15:43.543 --> 15:44.544
INTERACT WITH OUR YOUNG

15:44.544 --> 15:47.613
BLACK YOUTH IS PROBLEMATIC.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.614
OUR CHILDREN ARE AFRAID.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.750
AND IT IS TOTALLY AGAINST

15:50.750 --> 15:51.417
ANYTHING RELATIVE TO

15:51.417 --> 15:52.385
POLICING THAT OUR YOUTH

15:52.385 --> 15:55.021
SHOULD BE AFRAID OF LAW BE

15:55.021 --> 15:56.088
EN-- LAW ENFORCEMENT.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.123
>> YOU REALIZE SOMEONE IS

15:57.123 --> 15:58.157
GOING TO WATCH THE PROGRAM

15:58.157 --> 15:59.225
AND SAY HOW IS IT THAT A

15:59.225 --> 16:00.193
POLICE OFFICER HAS TO HAVE A

16:00.193 --> 16:02.261
CONVERSATION WITH HIS SON

16:02.261 --> 16:03.963
WARNING THAT SON ABOUT

16:03.963 --> 16:06.432
INTERACTIONS WITH HIS FELLOW

16:06.432 --> 16:09.402
POLICE OFFICERS BECAUSE

16:09.402 --> 16:10.603
THOSE POLICE OFFICERS

16:10.603 --> 16:12.471
INCLUDING MYSELF, WE SEE HOW

16:12.471 --> 16:14.507
THE INTERACTION GOES BETWEEN

16:14.507 --> 16:16.609
THE COMMUNITY, YOUNG BLACK

16:16.609 --> 16:17.310
MALES AND THE POLICE

16:17.310 --> 16:18.344
DEPARTMENT.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.679
I REMEMBER ME RECENTLY GOING

16:19.679 --> 16:21.047
TO A POLICE OFFICER, I WENT

16:21.047 --> 16:22.048
TO ASK HIM A QUESTION.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.916
THIS GUY GAVE ME A LOOK THAT

16:23.916 --> 16:26.285
WAS SO ATTORNEY LIKE HE GAVE

16:26.285 --> 16:28.154
ME A REAL STRONG, HARD LOOK.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.189
AND I HAD TO IDENTIFY MYSELF,

16:30.189 --> 16:31.657
BEFORE ANYTHING GOES WRONG,

16:31.657 --> 16:32.425
THE FIRST THING I DO IS

16:32.425 --> 16:34.360
LISTEN, I'M RETIRED

16:34.360 --> 16:35.127
LIEUTENANT FROM THE JOB.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.062
THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING,

16:36.062 --> 16:37.096
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO TELL

16:37.096 --> 16:37.430
YOU.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.798
AND THEN, HE STILL WAS A

16:38.798 --> 16:40.032
LITTLE DISTANT BUT HE CAME

16:40.032 --> 16:41.267
DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE

16:41.267 --> 16:43.336
HI TO EXPLAIN, LISTEN, I'M A

16:43.336 --> 16:44.036
PART OF THE COMMUNITY.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.671
I'M COMING TO YOU FOR HELP.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.373
>> WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THESE

16:47.373 --> 16:48.441
CONVERSATIONS THAT MOTHERS

16:48.441 --> 16:50.476
HAVE WITH HER TEENS, EVEN

16:50.476 --> 16:52.478
POST FERGUSON, POST GARNER.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.212
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT

16:53.212 --> 16:55.181
THIS, WAS THERE AN ADDED

16:55.181 --> 16:56.215
LEGITIMACY BECAUSE IT WAS A

16:56.215 --> 16:57.283
WHITE MAYOR STANDING AT A

16:57.283 --> 16:58.651
PODIUM SAYING THAT HE HAD TO

16:58.651 --> 16:59.352
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.019
>> YES.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.454
>> WHEREAS AFRICAN-AMERICAN

17:01.454 --> 17:02.488
FAMILIES SAYS WELL, THAT'S

17:02.488 --> 17:03.556
NOT NEWS TO US.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.924
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

17:04.924 --> 17:05.825
DEFINITELY, THIS

17:05.825 --> 17:08.327
CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE IS

17:08.327 --> 17:10.029
NOT NEW BUT THE DIFFERENCE

17:10.029 --> 17:11.397
HERE IS THERE IS A WHITE

17:11.397 --> 17:13.866
MAYOR WHO IS STANDING BY ALL

17:13.866 --> 17:15.935
OF THE POWER THAT COMES WITH

17:15.935 --> 17:17.637
BEING MAYOR AND SAYING THAT

17:17.637 --> 17:19.405
HE HAD THE SAME CONVERSATION.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.873
AND SO IT SOMEHOW LEGITIMIZES

17:20.873 --> 17:22.408
SO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND

17:22.408 --> 17:23.576
CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT THIS

17:23.576 --> 17:24.844
HAPPENS OR AT LEAST BRINGS

17:24.844 --> 17:25.778
IT TO THE FOREFRONT THAT

17:25.778 --> 17:26.779
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS TO

17:26.779 --> 17:27.780
BE ADDRESSED.

17:27.780 --> 17:28.781
>> ALL RIGHT, L. JOY

17:28.781 --> 17:29.682
WILLIAMS AND JULIAN HARPER,

17:38.824 --> 17:40.259
NEXT WEEKEND: HOW THE POLICE SEE

17:40.259 --> 17:41.160
IT.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.495
WE'LL GET THE PERSPECTIVE FROM

17:42.495 --> 17:45.298
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.432
IF YOU'VE GONE TO A BROADWAY

17:46.432 --> 17:48.034
PLAY RECENTLY, YOU KNOW JUST HOW

17:48.034 --> 17:49.802
EXPENSIVE A TICKET CAN BE.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.137
STAGING A PLAY IS ALSO VERY,

17:51.137 --> 17:52.338
VERY PRICY.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.706
NOW, TO SAVE MONEY AND TO CREATE

17:53.706 --> 17:55.141
A NEW EXPERIENCE, SOME PRODUCERS

17:55.141 --> 17:57.643
ARE PUTTING ON PERFORMANCES IN

17:57.643 --> 18:00.513
VERY UNLIKELY LOCATIONS.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.882
ONE PLAY WAS EVEN PERFORMED THIS

18:02.882 --> 18:04.483
PAST FALL ON THE GOWANUS CANAL

18:04.483 --> 18:05.718
IN BROOKLYN.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.320
A BODY OF WATER MUCH BETTER

18:07.320 --> 18:08.521
KNOWN FOR SEWAGE OVERFLOWS AND

18:08.521 --> 18:09.789
INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION THAN

18:09.789 --> 18:10.790
ANYTHING CONNECTED TO THE

18:10.790 --> 18:12.124
THEATRE.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.794
THE NEWSHOUR'S ZACHARY GREEN

18:14.794 --> 18:17.997
REPORTS.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.032
>> Reporter: COME TO TIMES

18:20.032 --> 18:21.801
SQUARE IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

18:21.801 --> 18:24.637
THIS IS A SITE YOU'RE LIKELY TO

18:24.637 --> 18:28.040
SEE: PEOPLE LINED UP AT THE

18:28.040 --> 18:29.475
TICKETS BOOTH TO BUY DISCOUNT

18:29.475 --> 18:30.576
TICKETS TO POPULAR BROADWAY

18:30.576 --> 18:31.644
SHOWS.

18:31.644 --> 18:32.611
THERE'S A REASON THIS LINE IS SO

18:32.611 --> 18:33.546
LONG.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.447
GOING TO SEE A PLAY IN THE

18:34.447 --> 18:35.815
THEATER-MECCA OF NEW YORK IS AN

18:35.815 --> 18:37.283
EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.784
THE AVERAGE COST OF A BROADWAY

18:38.784 --> 18:40.052
TICKET IS NOW OVER $100.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.754
YOU CAN CHALK THAT PRICE UP TO

18:41.754 --> 18:43.022
THE HIGH DEMAND TO SEE CERTAIN

18:43.022 --> 18:44.457
SHOWS, BUT ALSO TO HIGH

18:44.457 --> 18:46.025
PRODUCTION COSTS.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.059
AND IN NEW YORK, ONE OF THE

18:47.059 --> 18:48.160
BIGGEST LINE-ITEMS IN A PLAY'S

18:48.160 --> 18:49.161
BUDGET CAN BE SUMMED UP IN ONE

18:49.161 --> 18:50.262
WORD.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.297
>> SPACE.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.298
I THINK SPACE IS THE TOUGHEST

18:52.298 --> 18:53.766
ONE.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.267
>> Reporter: JOHN GOULD RUBIN IS

18:55.267 --> 18:56.302
A THEATER DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER

18:56.302 --> 18:57.236
WHO HAS BEEN PRODUCING THEATER

18:57.236 --> 18:59.105
IN NEW YORK FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.973
HE SAYS THAT EVEN WORKING OFF-

19:00.973 --> 19:02.575
BROADWAY THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE

19:02.575 --> 19:04.176
SPACE OFTEN MAKES UP THE BIGGEST

19:04.176 --> 19:06.812
COST IN ANY PRODUCTION'S BUDGET.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.514
>> GETTING A THEATER IS THE MOST

19:08.514 --> 19:10.016
EXPENSIVE EXPENSE.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.084
THAT'LL BE FOUR, THREE-- FOUR,

19:12.084 --> 19:13.019
OR $5,000 A WEEK.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.453
>> Reporter: A WEEK?

19:14.453 --> 19:17.256
>> YEAH.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.024
A WEEK.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.025
FOR THE THEATER THAT YOU'RE

19:19.025 --> 19:20.059
PERFORMING IN.

19:20.059 --> 19:20.960
>> Reporter: THE COST OF SPACE

19:20.960 --> 19:21.827
ISN'T JUST DRIVING UP TICKET

19:21.827 --> 19:22.762
PRICES.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.030
IT'S ALSO DRIVING ARTISTS AND

19:24.030 --> 19:25.297
PERFORMERS TO SOME UNLIKELY

19:25.297 --> 19:26.432
LOCATIONS IN THE SEARCH TO FIND

19:26.432 --> 19:27.700
CHEAPER OR EVEN FREE SPACES TO

19:27.700 --> 19:28.868
PERFORM IN.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.236
THE E.P.A. ADDED THE GOWANUS

19:30.236 --> 19:31.570
CANAL TO ITS LIST OF SUPERFUND

19:31.570 --> 19:33.873
CLEAN-UP SITES IN 2010, AND IT

19:33.873 --> 19:35.341
SAYS THE CANAL IS ONE OF THE

19:35.341 --> 19:36.609
NATION'S MOST SERIOUSLY

19:36.609 --> 19:38.377
CONTAMINATED BODIES OF WATER.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.012
SO IT'S NOT THE FIRST PLACE YOU

19:40.012 --> 19:41.781
MIGHT THINK OF FOR RECREATION,

19:41.781 --> 19:43.282
LET ALONE PUTTING ON A PLAY.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.750
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT A GROUP

19:44.750 --> 19:46.352
OF LOCAL PERFORMANCE ARTISTS DID

19:46.352 --> 19:49.021
IN OCTOBER.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.290
FOR THREE WEEKS THIS PAST FALL,

19:51.290 --> 19:53.359
THE GOWANUS CANAL WAS

19:53.359 --> 19:57.329
TRANSFORMED BY NIGHT INTO THE

19:57.329 --> 19:58.264
STYX, THE RIVER THAT RUNS

19:58.264 --> 20:00.666
THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD IN GREEK

20:00.666 --> 20:01.934
MYTHOLOGY, AS PART OF A NEW PLAY

20:01.934 --> 20:03.002
CALLED "THE DREARY COAST."

20:03.002 --> 20:04.437
>> I TEND TO WORK WITH SITES.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.405
AND I TEND TO LOOK FOR SITES

20:06.405 --> 20:09.375
THAT WILL ON THEIR OWN ENGAGE AN

20:09.375 --> 20:11.010
AUDIENCE.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.078
>> Reporter: JEFF STARK IS A NEW

20:12.078 --> 20:13.279
YORK-BASED ARTIST WHO DEVISED

20:13.279 --> 20:16.515
"THE DREARY COAST."

20:16.515 --> 20:18.050
THE PLAY FOLLOWS CHARON, THE

20:18.050 --> 20:19.585
BOATMAN IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY WHO

20:19.585 --> 20:23.989
FERRIES SOULS THROUGH THE

20:23.989 --> 20:25.157
AFTERLIFE AS HE ENCOUNTERS

20:25.157 --> 20:26.358
DEMONS, GODS, AND THE DEAD ON

20:26.358 --> 20:27.393
HIS TRIP DOWN THE RIVER.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.394
>> YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND,

20:28.394 --> 20:29.428
HERMES.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.763
>> Reporter: FOR JUST $35,

20:30.763 --> 20:32.131
AUDIENCE MEMBERS COULD NOT ONLY

20:32.131 --> 20:33.566
WATCH FROM THE BOAT, BUT ALSO

20:33.566 --> 20:35.434
TAKE PART IN THE PERFORMANCE

20:35.434 --> 20:36.969
ITSELF, DRESSED AS DEAD SOULS

20:36.969 --> 20:38.237
BEING SHEPHERDED THROUGH THE

20:38.237 --> 20:39.405
UNDERWORLD.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.272
THE PLAY IS PART OF A GROWING

20:40.272 --> 20:41.307
ART FORM CALLED SITE-SPECIFIC

20:41.307 --> 20:42.508
THEATER, AUDIENCE IMMERSIVE

20:42.508 --> 20:43.776
PRODUCTIONS THAT ARE BUILT

20:43.776 --> 20:45.177
AROUND THE SPACE THEY'RE

20:45.177 --> 20:46.212
PERFORMED IN.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.413
WE SPOKE WITH STARK DURING THE

20:47.413 --> 20:48.614
RUN OF HIS SHOW, AND HE SAID THE

20:48.614 --> 20:49.615
REASON FOR THIS IS PARTLY ABOUT

20:49.615 --> 20:50.816
ECONOMICS.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.151
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

20:52.151 --> 20:53.252
GREAT ABOUT OUR SHOW IS THAT WE

20:53.252 --> 20:54.420
ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY

20:54.420 --> 20:56.722
MONEY ON A THEATRE.

20:56.722 --> 20:57.990
WE ARE OUT WORKING IN PUBLIC

20:57.990 --> 20:58.724
SPACE.

20:58.724 --> 20:59.892
>> Reporter: THIS ISN'T THE

20:59.892 --> 21:01.127
FIRST TIME STARK HAS DONE THIS

21:01.127 --> 21:09.068
KIND OF WORK.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.069
HIS FIRST SITE-SPECIFIC PLAY

21:10.069 --> 21:11.303
"I.R.T." WAS PERFORMED IN 2009

21:11.303 --> 21:12.705
ON THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.106
HE FOLLOWED IT UP WITH "THE

21:14.106 --> 21:15.508
SWEET CHEAT," A PLAY ABOUT A

21:15.508 --> 21:16.942
POST-APOCALYPTIC NEW YORK THAT

21:16.942 --> 21:17.943
WAS PERFORMED IN AN ABANDONED

21:17.943 --> 21:18.978
WAREHOUSE NORTH OF THE CITY.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.079
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE MAKING

21:20.079 --> 21:23.516
SITE-SPECIFIC THEATER.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.151
IN FACT, ONE OF NEW YORK'S MORE

21:25.151 --> 21:26.585
POPULAR LONG-RUNNING SHOWS IS

21:26.585 --> 21:28.320
"SLEEP NO MORE" AN AVANT-GARDE

21:28.320 --> 21:30.089
RETELLING OF SHAKESPEARE'S

21:30.089 --> 21:31.524
"MACBETH," PERFORMED IN THREE

21:31.524 --> 21:32.791
ADJOINING WAREHOUSES IN

21:32.791 --> 21:34.160
MANHATTAN DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE

21:34.160 --> 21:35.528
AN OLD HOTEL.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.595
JOHN GOULD RUBIN HAS ALSO USED

21:36.595 --> 21:37.796
THE SITE-SPECIFIC FORMAT IN HIS

21:37.796 --> 21:38.931
OWN WORK.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.199
>> I DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS MUCH

21:40.199 --> 21:41.433
LESS EXPENSIVE AND BECAUSE IT

21:41.433 --> 21:43.135
WOULD ENDOW THE AUDIENCE, WHICH-

21:43.135 --> 21:44.503
- WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

21:44.503 --> 21:47.106
EXPERIENCE.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.774
YOU'RE IN AN EXPERIENCE IF YOU

21:48.774 --> 21:50.209
GO TO THE THEATER WHICH IS ONE

21:50.209 --> 21:51.744
THAT YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.078
BUT IF YOU GO TO A PLACE, THE

21:53.078 --> 21:54.280
ADDRESS OF WHICH YOU'VE BEEN

21:54.280 --> 21:55.748
GIVEN THAT MORNING BY A

21:55.748 --> 21:57.349
TELEPHONE OR AN E-MAIL, YOU'RE

21:57.349 --> 21:59.185
ALREADY PRIMED FOR AN UNUSUAL

21:59.185 --> 22:00.819
EXPERIENCE.

22:00.819 --> 22:05.457
AND SO, IT IS ECONOMICS.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.559
BUT IT'S ALSO A WAY OF ENDOWING

22:06.559 --> 22:07.359
THE AUDIENCE WITH AN UNUSUAL

22:07.359 --> 22:08.360
EXPERIENCE.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.497
>> WE ARE NOT HERE FOR YOU.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.133
WE ARE HERE FOR THEM.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.535
>> MAZEL TOV!

22:32.151 --> 22:33.719
WHO ARE GROWING UP POOR,

22:33.719 --> 22:34.920
STRUGGLING WITH ISOLATION AND

22:34.920 --> 22:36.155
LACK OF OPPORTUNITY.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.389
THE FILM WAS THE WINNER OF THE

22:37.389 --> 22:38.591
2014 SUNDANCE PRIZE FOR BEST

23:47.026 --> 23:48.060
THIS IS WHAT GOES THROUGH

23:48.060 --> 23:49.795
MY MIND.

23:49.795 --> 23:50.863
GOD HAS TO BE BUSY WITH

23:50.863 --> 23:56.302
EVERYONE ELSE.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.108
EVENTUALLY HE WILL COME INTO

24:03.108 --> 24:05.778
MY LIFE.

24:06.912 --> 24:10.783
I HOPE IT HAPPENS.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.984
IT'S GOING TO BREAK MY HEART

24:11.984 --> 24:14.019
IF IT DON'T.
