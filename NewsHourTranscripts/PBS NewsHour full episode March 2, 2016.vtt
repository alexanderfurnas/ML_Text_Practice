GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.474 --> 00:11.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Front-runners
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
take Super

00:11.745 --> 00:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuesday by storm -- what this
means for the
parties and the rest of the
presidential race.

00:17.084 --> 00:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
The Supreme Court hears its
first abortion

00:21.421 --> 00:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case in nine years, a law that
could add toughening
restrictions to clinics in Texas
and beyond.

00:28.095 --> 00:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then, we talk with
the U.S. ambassador
to the U.N., Samantha Power,
about the toughest

00:34.001 --> 00:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sanctions yet on North Korea.

00:36.236 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: Astronaut
Scott Kelly
returns home after spending
nearly a year

00:41.642 --> 00:44.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in space, a record for an
American astronaut.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT KELLY, NASA Astronaut: On
one hand,
I look forward to going home,
but it's something

00:48.148 --> 00:51.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has been such a big part of
my life.
And I'm going to miss it.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.655 --> 00:58.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.992 --> 01:12.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Super Tuesday has
given way to
what might be dubbed whither
Wednesday, as

01:12.439 --> 01:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, how much longer can this go
on? The Republican
and Democratic leaders forged
ahead today,

01:18.312 --> 01:21.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving rivals with some hard
calculating
to do.

01:21.214 --> 01:24.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
What a Super Tuesday.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:26.253 --> 01:30.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It was a big night
for front-runners
Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump. With seven

01:30.090 --> 01:34.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Super Tuesday wins apiece, each
now holds
commanding leads.

01:34.594 --> 01:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the rest of the field,
Tuesday's results
dramatically narrowed any path
to the nomination.

01:39.566 --> 01:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But most promised, for now, to
press on. Ted
Cruz won three states last night
and he campaigned

01:46.340 --> 01:47.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
late today in Kansas.

01:47.908 --> 01:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, Marco Rubio cast his
vote early
for the March 15 Florida
primary.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
You know, last night was
supposed to be Ted

01:54.748 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz's night. We beat him in
half the states
on the ballot. We won the state
of Minnesota.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We picked up a lot of delegates
and we feel
great about what the map looks
like now moving

02:01.621 --> 02:03.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And although he won
no states
yesterday, Ohio Governor John
Kasich headed

02:06.460 --> 02:08.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Michigan this afternoon.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Listen, we have an election
coming, they tell

02:10.197 --> 02:15.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, and it would be really,
really if the
people in Michigan voted for
somebody from

02:15.836 --> 02:17.704 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ohio.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ben Carson, who has
trailed far
behind the others, announced
today he is dropping

02:21.274 --> 02:27.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of tomorrow's GOP debate in
his hometown
of Detroit, writing supporters:
"I do not

02:27.247 --> 02:30.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see a political path forward."

02:30.450 --> 02:35.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders won
four states last night,
Minnesota, Oklahoma,

02:35.889 --> 02:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colorado and his home state of
Vermont. He
campaigned in Maine today,
taking shots at

02:41.695 --> 02:43.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both Clinton and Trump.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
And it turns out that when they
do these matchups

02:47.501 --> 02:53.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Sanders vs Trump, Clinton vs
Trump, we
almost always do better in those
matchups

02:53.807 --> 03:02.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than Secretary Clinton. So, if
people want
a candidate who will defeat one
or another

03:02.315 --> 03:06.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these right-wing Republicans,
I think you're
looking at him this afternoon.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:08.755 --> 03:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Clinton won
significantly
more delegates, with lopsided
victories mostly

03:12.726 --> 03:14.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the South.

03:14.594 --> 03:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many Republicans have not
embraced Trump's
status as prohibitive
front-runner. Mitt Romney,

03:19.699 --> 03:25.338 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
the party's 2012
standard-bearer, announced
he will deliver an address on
the state of

03:25.372 --> 03:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the race tomorrow. And although
he has been
harshly critical of Trump, there
was no indication

03:30.710 --> 03:35.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he plans to endorse a candidate
or jump in
the race himself.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats appeared to relished
Trump's triumph.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: Republicans
shouldn't be surprised. They
spent eight years

03:41.288 --> 03:46.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laying the groundwork for the
rise of Donald
Trump. The reality is that
Republican leaders

03:46.993 --> 03:48.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are reaping what they have sown.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tuesday night's
winners are clearly
setting their sights on the
general election

03:52.966 --> 03:54.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and on each other.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It's
clear tonight
that the stakes in this election
have never

03:58.905 --> 04:06.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been higher, and the rhetoric
we're hearing
on the other side has never been
lower.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

04:08.014 --> 04:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Once we get all of this
finished, I'm going

04:10.817 --> 04:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go after one person -- that's
Hillary Clinton
-- on the assumption that she's
allowed to

04:14.488 --> 04:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run, which is a big assumption.
I don't know
that she's going to be allowed
to run. And

04:20.026 --> 04:22.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's, frankly, going
to be an easy
race.

04:22.162 --> 04:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Voters in more than
a dozen states
head to the polls over the next
two weeks,

04:26.233 --> 04:31.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including in delegate-rich
Florida, North
Carolina, Ohio, and Michigan.

04:31.738 --> 04:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will analyze the state of the
race after
the news summary.

04:35.242 --> 04:39.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, the
U.N. Security Council approved
the toughest

04:39.546 --> 04:45.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions on North Korea in 20
years. It's
punishment for nuclear and
missile tests earlier

04:45.585 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

04:47.354 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sanctions will mandate
inspections of
all cargo shipped to and from
North Korea

04:51.958 --> 04:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by land, sea or air. They also
freeze financial
assets and cut off weapons sales
to what's

04:58.999 --> 05:05.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officially called the Democratic
People's
Republic of Korea. The vote was
unanimous,

05:05.205 --> 05:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with U.S. Ambassador to U.N.
Samantha Power
saying existing sanctions don't
go far enough.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: That is why the
resolution we have

05:13.880 --> 05:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just adopted is so much tougher
than any prior
North Korea resolution. We have
studied the

05:19.719 --> 05:26.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways the DPRK has been able to
exploit gaps
and evade measures aimed at
impeding its nuclear

05:26.760 --> 05:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons and ballistic missile
programs . And
we have put in place new
measures to fill

05:31.097 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those gaps one by one.

05:32.933 --> 05:37.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will speak
with Ambassador
Power later in the program.

05:37.337 --> 05:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the first time,
the U.S. military
has captured a significant
Islamic State leader

05:42.475 --> 05:48.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Iraq. It's widely reported he
was seized
last month by a special
operations unit that

05:48.081 --> 05:53.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recently deployed. The group's
mission is
to disrupt ISIS in Iraq and
Syria. Officials

05:53.820 --> 05:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have not released the militant
leader's identity.

05:56.323 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pressure built on
the Balkan
states today to let more
migrants move north

06:01.728 --> 06:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Greece. Macedonia did let
170 people
cross its border, but many
thousands more

06:08.568 --> 06:09.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are still stranded.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Mates of Independent
Television News
is there:

06:13.206 --> 06:19.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: The door has
finally opened,
albeit just a crack, a few
Syrian and Iraqi

06:19.512 --> 06:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families with young children
today allowed
from Greece into Macedonia,
14-year-old Ribhan

06:25.619 --> 06:31.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and her 8-old sister, Rezan,
among the first
to pass through this tiny door
to what they

06:31.291 --> 06:32.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hope is a new life.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many days have you been
waiting in the
camp?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GIRL: Ten.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES MATES: Ten days? And where
do you want
to go to now?

06:39.432 --> 06:41.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GIRL: Germany.

06:41.334 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: From the other side
of the fence,
those not getting through
watched and shouted

06:45.739 --> 06:47.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their frustrations.

06:47.073 --> 06:53.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Be merciful for all those
people. We
are not terrorists.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CROWD: Open! Open!

06:55.415 --> 06:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATES: The prime minister
of Slovakia,
one of the countries on the
refugee route,

06:58.351 --> 07:02.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
had come to see how his
policemen were helping
to block the passage north.

07:02.789 --> 07:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been the first movement
through this
border post for 48 hours or so.
Whether it's

07:06.626 --> 07:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of a change of police or
simply connected
to this official visit, we will
find out soon

07:11.364 --> 07:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough. But, either way, the
flow is barely
a trickle, while the numbers
still arriving

07:18.204 --> 07:24.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Greece resemble a flood, more
than 2,000
a day, many today making their
way through

07:24.344 --> 07:27.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fields towards this same crowded
camp.

07:27.314 --> 07:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As of today, some
30,000 people
are now waiting in Greece for
the chance to

07:33.119 --> 07:34.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
move north.

07:34.921 --> 07:39.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Another piece of a
long-missing
Malaysia Airlines flight may
have been found.

07:39.559 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turned up on Mozambique over
the weekend.
That's thousands of miles from
Flight 370's

07:45.165 --> 07:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last known coordinates, before
it vanished
two years ago. So far, the only
confirmed

07:51.071 --> 07:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trace of the plane is a part of
one wing.
It was found last year on
another island off

07:56.276 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Africa.

07:58.044 --> 08:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Indonesia was
spared major
damage today from a powerful
earthquake. It

08:02.415 --> 08:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a magnitude of 7.8 and was
centered 400
miles off Sumatra. Police in the
coastal city

08:08.722 --> 08:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Padang initially issued
tsunami warnings
and evacuated a hospital. But,
in the end,

08:15.161 --> 08:16.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
residents were largely
unaffected.

08:16.963 --> 08:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Wall Street
managed modest
gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average was

08:22.302 --> 08:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up 34 points to close just short
of 16900.
The Nasdaq rose nearly 14
points, and the

08:29.442 --> 08:32.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the first
major abortion case in a decade
is heard at

08:37.317 --> 08:43.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court; charting the
path to the
White House after Super Tuesday;
Donald Trump

08:43.523 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the future of the Republican
Party; and
much more.

08:49.896 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Big wins on Super
Tuesday,
and impressive delegate leads,
have both the

09:03.510 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and Clinton campaigns
starting to set
their sites on the general
election.

09:07.881 --> 09:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We have got work to do, but that
work -- that

09:15.121 --> 09:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work is not to make America
great again. America
never stopped being great. We...

09:21.161 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

09:22.328 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We have
to make America
whole.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
She wants to make America whole
again. And

09:28.735 --> 09:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am trying to figure out, what
is that all
about? Make America great again
is going to

09:32.739 --> 09:35.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be much better than making
America whole again.

09:35.675 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we unpack
last night's
results, and how it shapes the
road to the

09:40.447 --> 09:45.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House, with Reid Wilson,
chief political
correspondent for The Morning
Consult, and

09:46.019 --> 09:50.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Susan Page, Washington bureau
chief for USA
Today.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, let's -- they're
focusing, already,
to some extent, on the general
election, but

09:56.029 --> 09:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's talk about what they still
have to deal
with in the primaries.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Susan, what did you make of the
Super Tuesday
result on the Democratic side?

10:03.570 --> 10:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
On the Democratic side, I think
it was a pretty

10:05.305 --> 10:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good night for Hillary Clinton.
She won seven
states. The sweetest victory had
to be in

10:09.876 --> 10:11.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Massachusetts.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a state right next door
to Vermont.
It's a state that knows Bernie
Sanders well.

10:14.514 --> 10:18.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's a state that is
famously liberal.
And for her to beat Bernie
Sanders in Massachusetts,

10:18.318 --> 10:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, was a sign that while
he will still
win some states, and he won some
states last

10:22.956 --> 10:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night, that she is now on a
pretty steady
path toward the nomination.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you read
of what the
voters were saying through the
exit polls?

10:30.029 --> 10:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult: We
still saw
a pretty divided Democratic
Party.

10:33.299 --> 10:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One half wants a candidate who
shares their
values, a candidate who cares
about people

10:39.138 --> 10:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like them. Bernie Sanders is
winning that
half. The other half is looking
towards November.

10:43.309 --> 10:47.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They want an experienced
candidate. They want
an electable candidate. And
those voters are

10:47.981 --> 10:49.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going with Hillary Clinton.

10:49.916 --> 10:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The difference, though, is in
the early states,
in Iowa, New Hampshire, the sort
of optimistic,

10:55.788 --> 11:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideological, idealistic voters
were outweighing
the experience and electability
voters. Now

11:02.529 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have shifted to a part of the
campaign
where those sort of more
traditional Democrats

11:06.199 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking for a win in involve
play a much bigger
role in the Democratic
coalition.

11:09.736 --> 11:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: But I think the two
parties have
slightly different problems with
their electorates.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Democrats, it's not as
though Democratic
voters supporting Sanders find
Clinton unacceptable.

11:17.443 --> 11:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, will they be
energized, will
they be enthusiastic and
therefore turn out

11:21.881 --> 11:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote in November, whereas
Republicans have
a big problem with a significant
numbers of

11:26.252 --> 11:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican voters who find
Donald Trump unacceptable.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. And the
turnout in Democrats,
striking that it's smaller than
it was the

11:32.158 --> 11:33.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last time.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk quickly about Bernie
Sanders, Susan,
and let's quickly look at the
delegate count.

11:38.064 --> 11:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, if you're a -- the
Democrats, to
win the nomination, you need
almost 2,400

11:43.670 --> 11:48.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delegates. Hillary Clinton
already has over
1,000.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are saying, OK, Bernie
Sanders, he's
done a great job, but some are
saying, why

11:52.712 --> 11:54.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is he staying in?

11:54.581 --> 11:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Although I think
those numbers
are misleading, because her
numbers are really

11:56.516 --> 12:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boosted by her support among
those superdelegates,
Democratic officials who are
automatically

12:00.753 --> 12:02.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
convention delegates.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If something happened, if for
some reason
she hit some huge stumbling
block, they could

12:05.658 --> 12:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easily turn away to a different
candidate.
They're not obliged to vote for
her. That

12:09.796 --> 12:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, clearly, the Democratic
Party establishment
wants Hillary Clinton to be the
nominee. And

12:14.901 --> 12:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would like this nomination
battle wrapped
up as soon as possible and with
as few wounds

12:19.072 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And if you're
Bernie Sanders,
what are you hearing right now
from the voters

12:23.710 --> 12:25.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and from the Democratic
establishment?

12:25.545 --> 12:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, the path that
Bernie Sanders
has to take to get to those
2,380 delegates

12:30.883 --> 12:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessary to win the nomination
is pretty
steep.

12:33.353 --> 12:37.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way the Democratic calendar
is set up,
it sort of favors the
front-runner. Recall,

12:37.857 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back in 2008, Super Tuesday gave
a state -- a
U.S. senator named Barack Obama
just enough

12:43.262 --> 12:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a lead over Hillary Clinton
that he could
sort of sustain it through the
long, grueling

12:48.334 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months until he got to those
delegates necessary
to win.

12:51.604 --> 12:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what the Sanders campaign has
to do right
now is, they have to win by
increasingly larger

12:56.909 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shares as the contest goes on.
That becomes
harder and harder, especially in
a party that

13:01.581 --> 13:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shows that it's OK with Hillary
Clinton.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Susan,
let's talk
about the Republicans.

13:05.184 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You mentioned Donald Trump. We
have a little
bit of news today, in that Ben
Carson let

13:09.288 --> 13:12.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it be known that he will not be
staying in
the race. I guess he will make
the formal

13:12.458 --> 13:14.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
announcement later.

13:14.193 --> 13:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that do to the field?
Obviously,
one person less. Does it change
anything?

13:19.165 --> 13:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is now so much pressure on
the Republicans
to do something about Donald
Trump.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think that it has
very little
effect.

13:26.339 --> 13:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ben Carson's support had gotten
pretty low.
If you look at it, maybe it
boosts Ted Cruz

13:31.277 --> 13:35.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit because of the
evangelical Christian
nature of a lot of Ben Carson's
support. I

13:35.682 --> 13:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think it's not important. I
think it's not
really a significant factor.

13:39.519 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you did have today were
wealthy contributors
to the Republican Party who are
unhappy with

13:45.158 --> 13:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea of a Trump candidacy
seeing if they
can do something to stop him.
And I think

13:49.395 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is not likely to have much
more effect
than Ben Carson pulling out.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These big donors have not had
the kind of
effect this year that they have
had in years

13:58.604 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past. So, super PACs that got so
much attention
early on didn't save Jeb Bush at
all in his

14:04.243 --> 14:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidacy. So it seems to me
that a candidate
like Donald Trump, who has
gotten where he

14:09.716 --> 14:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is by attracting Republican
voters to primaries
and caucuses, is not going to be
undone by

14:15.121 --> 14:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contributors deciding they're
not happy with
him.

14:17.423 --> 14:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Reid, what
are the Republican
voters saying?

14:20.059 --> 14:24.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A number of them were
interviewed in these
exit polls. What are they saying
about why

14:24.230 --> 14:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are supporting Donald
Trump, if they
are, and if they're not, why
not?

14:27.767 --> 14:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, again, there
is this sort
of division as on the Democratic
side.

14:31.604 --> 14:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The division on the Republican
side, though,
is between those who want an
electable candidate,

14:36.609 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney -- Marco Rubio --
excuse me -- Freudian
slip. Marco Rubio tends to win
those candidates

14:42.415 --> 14:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and do much better among them.

14:44.217 --> 14:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, there are
candidates who
-- there are voters who want
change and who

14:48.054 --> 14:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want somebody who will tell it
like it is.
And that's the single biggest
segment that

14:52.492 --> 14:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is voting for Donald Trump.
There are a lot
of voters out there who feel
like they haven't

14:55.895 --> 15:01.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gotten the straight truth from
politicians,
not only politicians at large,
but even Republican

15:01.834 --> 15:03.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politicians.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A huge percentage of the
Republican electorate
doesn't trust their own
politicians. They're

15:06.973 --> 15:07.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump voters.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:09.142 --> 15:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me. I was
just going
to say, how does one account,
though, for

15:11.144 --> 15:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the just surprisingly high
turnout among Republicans?
Maybe if you're Donald Trump,
you don't think

15:17.850 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's so surprising, but he's
bringing new
people into the voting booth,
isn't he?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, two things are
happening.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One, we have had this
record-size field, so
you have had a lot of candidates
out there

15:27.059 --> 15:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to get their voters to
the polls. That's
had one effect. But I do think
Donald Trump

15:30.963 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is bringing new and different
people to the
Republican Party. And if he's
the nominee,

15:35.535 --> 15:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will redefine to at least
some extent what
it means to be a Republican,
what the Republican

15:39.872 --> 15:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party stands for, because these
are voters
who are not necessarily free
traders in the

15:44.577 --> 15:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican tradition, or for a
muscular national
defense.

15:48.347 --> 15:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are people who are focused
on the economy
at home, worried about their own
futures and

15:53.686 --> 15:58.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have an approach to politics
that is different
from the old Republican Party.

15:58.057 --> 16:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And these new
voters, I think,
Reid Wilson, make it harder for
those who

16:03.729 --> 16:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are trying to come up with a
scenario to get
rid of Donald Trump.

16:06.866 --> 16:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, just quickly, let's look at
the delegates
on the Republican side. You need
1,237 to

16:11.504 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win the nomination. Trump has
319. Cruz is
at 226. So it's a lead, but it
doesn't look

16:18.978 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like an overwhelming lead. You
just look at
these numbers.

16:21.514 --> 16:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: It's not, but once
again, because
of the proportional rules under
which this

16:26.252 --> 16:31.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calendar is operating, it is
harder and harder
as the calendar goes on for
somebody to make

16:31.257 --> 16:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up even the smallest gap.

16:33.326 --> 16:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big moments left in this
campaign are
going to come on March 15, when,
under Republican

16:37.997 --> 16:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party rules, states can award
delegates on
a winner-take-all basis, the two
big prizes

16:43.002 --> 16:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that day, Ohio and Florida. Both
home state
candidates in the race, John
Kasich, the governor

16:49.375 --> 16:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Ohio, Marco Rubio, the
senator from Florida,
if those two can't win, if
Donald Trump wins

16:55.314 --> 16:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those states -- and he's ahead
in both -- then
this race is pretty much over.

16:58.618 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it just
gets fascinatinger
and fascinatinger every day.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:03.689 --> 17:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reid Wilson,
Susan Page, thank
you.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: You bet.

17:06.826 --> 17:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Over or not, the
battle within
the GOP is threatening to split
the party

17:10.196 --> 17:11.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in two.

17:11.664 --> 17:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get views from the pro-Trump
and the stop-Trump
wings of the party.

17:15.134 --> 17:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kansas Secretary of State Kris
Kobach endorsed
Trump this week, and strategist
Henry Barbour

17:20.306 --> 17:24.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Mississippi's Republican
National Committeeman.
He is backing Marco Rubio.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you for joining
us.

17:26.646 --> 17:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, starting with you, Henry
Barbour, what
is Donald Trump's success, his
electoral successes

17:32.585 --> 17:37.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the past few weeks, what is
It doing to
or for the party?

17:37.123 --> 17:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY BARBOUR, Republican
Strategist: Well,
you know, I think that remains
to be seen

17:42.695 --> 17:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what Donald Trump is doing to
the party.

17:44.964 --> 17:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we're still very early
in this process.
You have got to get 1,237
delegates to win.

17:52.805 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have only allocated some 728
delegates
to this point. And for Mr. Trump
to get to

18:03.549 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1,237, he has got a lot -- he
has a long ways
to get there.

18:09.221 --> 18:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not inevitable that Donald
Trump is going
to be our candidate. We have
1,100 delegates

18:15.661 --> 18:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that will be awarded in March
and April, and
there is no way that Mr. Trump
is going to

18:22.335 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to get there at the pace
that he's
been going. He won 42 percent of
the delegates

18:26.772 --> 18:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday. That would put him at
about 750
delegates at the end of April.

18:30.843 --> 18:36.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My point is, Gwen, we have a
long ways to
go in this process, and a
majority of Republicans,

18:36.549 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about two-thirds, are voting for
somebody
other than Mr. Trump.

18:40.286 --> 18:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, Mr. Barbour, is
this about
delegate nose-counting or this
about a rejection

18:44.824 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from so many Republicans of the
establishment,
of the way the Republican Party
has always

18:50.763 --> 18:52.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been structured?

18:52.531 --> 18:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY BARBOUR: Well, look, the
voters are
going to decide in the
Republican primaries

18:55.835 --> 19:00.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and caucuses around the country
who they want
to be our nominee, whether
that's Donald Trump

19:00.172 --> 19:06.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or Marco Rubio, who is a
candidate who I think
could -- that we could coalesce
behind and

19:06.612 --> 19:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who could beat Hillary Clinton.

19:08.314 --> 19:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm afraid Donald Trump would
lose in the
general election against Hillary
Clinton,

19:12.985 --> 19:17.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he can't answer a question
about the
Ku Klux Klan, whether he's for
them or against

19:17.223 --> 19:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. Sounded like he needed to
do a little
bit of studying or fix his
earpiece or something.

19:20.359 --> 19:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure what that was
about.

19:24.330 --> 19:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Reid mentioned in the
segment before this
that people like that Donald
Trump tells it

19:29.935 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like it is, but I think if you
ask the students
at Trump University, they
weren't told like

19:35.241 --> 19:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is. The New York attorney
general said
it was a bait and switch
program, a scam.

19:39.712 --> 19:43.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kris Kobach, why did
you decide
to endorse Donald Trump?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State:
Well, first and foremost,
because he's taking

19:45.584 --> 19:50.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strongest position we have
ever heard
a presidential candidate take on
illegal immigration

19:50.289 --> 19:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the vulnerability our
country faces with
respect to immigrants coming
legally through

19:55.428 --> 20:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the refugee system, which is
now, it appears,
being used by ISIS as way of
getting into

20:00.533 --> 20:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States and into
Western Europe,
and illegally.

20:03.669 --> 20:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the threat to our country in
terms of
national security and then the
threat to working

20:08.274 --> 20:13.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans who see their wages
depressed if
they don't lose their job, or
lose their job,

20:13.045 --> 20:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something that many people
say, look, Trump
is the guy who's actually going
to do something

20:17.450 --> 20:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it, and he's not speaking
in half-words
and half-tones. He's saying,
look, we're going

20:22.488 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to solve the problem and solve
it now.

20:24.423 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that I really
find appealing
about Donald Trump is he is
massively broadening

20:29.662 --> 20:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican base for the
first time in,
well, 25 years. And we have had
all of these

20:35.601 --> 20:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking heads and consultants
tell the party
-- Republican Party, well, the
way you broaden

20:39.171 --> 20:44.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your base is you roll over on
amnesty and
you tell everyone you're for
amnesty and then,

20:44.577 --> 20:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hopefully, instead of getting 30
percent of
the Hispanic vote, you will get
40 percent

20:48.247 --> 20:49.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Hispanic vote.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't broaden the base.
What Trump
is doing is broadening the base,
and we're

20:52.051 --> 20:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing it right before our very
eyes. But,
unfortunately, the Republican
establishment

20:55.955 --> 21:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is looking a gift horse in the
mouth and saying,
yes, we don't really want those
blue-collar

21:00.292 --> 21:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers who are coming over to
the Republican
Party.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's the biggest
thing Trump
offers is when you have
something like the

21:06.232 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reagan coalition, where you have
massive numbers
of Democrats and independents
who are working

21:10.736 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men and women voting Republican.
And I think
that's a huge threat to the
Democrat Party's

21:15.541 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
base too, if that happens.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I get the feeling
that Henry Barbour
wants to respond.

21:19.245 --> 21:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY BARBOUR: Well, it's just
funny that
Kris mentions gifts that Mr.
Trump has given.

21:26.719 --> 21:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know we he gave a gift to
Hillary Clinton
so she would come to his
wedding. And, I mean,

21:32.424 --> 21:36.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if that doesn't look like an
establishment
move, you know, I don't know
what is.

21:36.695 --> 21:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that, if you look at
Marco Rubio's
track record in Florida, he was
the original

21:44.370 --> 21:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renegade who ran against the
establishment
in Florida, a sitting governor
running for

21:49.642 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the U.S. Senate. Everybody told
Marco, you
can't do it. The Tea Party
rallied around

21:53.212 --> 21:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio and he won. And he's
been a real
reformer and he's made a real
difference as

21:58.017 --> 21:59.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a conservative.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the important
differences
for Republican primary voters to
understand

22:03.422 --> 22:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, we know that Marco Rubio is
a conservative.
Has a 98 percent rating with the
American

22:08.494 --> 22:10.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Conservative Union.

22:10.329 --> 22:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day, Donald Trump says he's
pro-choice.
The next day, he says he's
pro-life, yet he's

22:15.501 --> 22:18.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
giving money to Planned
Parenthood, which
funds abortions.

22:18.237 --> 22:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you both
about whether
this means -- the big discussion
here and

22:23.676 --> 22:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the country is whether
the Republican
Party is splitting apart.

22:27.079 --> 22:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you see, Kris Kobach, a way
that Donald
Trump goes to the convention,
plays by the

22:31.817 --> 22:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rules of this party, and unites
the party,
as he said last night he would?

22:36.055 --> 22:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: You know, I think
it is going
to happen, because, at the end
of the day,

22:39.858 --> 22:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
although there is grousing among
some of the
moneyed establishment interests
and some people

22:45.331 --> 22:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the RNC, but not all, they're
going to
have -- ultimately, if you have
this many

22:49.768 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters saying overwhelmingly,
yes, we like
Trump, which is what's happening
-- and you

22:53.706 --> 22:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to see more of it as
you get to
the winner-take-all states,
where the delegates

22:56.108 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are overwhelmingly in his corner
-- I can't
see any way that the RNC or the
Republican

23:00.379 --> 23:03.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment, however you
define it, would
then say, you know what? We're
going to try

23:03.616 --> 23:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find some way to derail the
Trump campaign.

23:05.584 --> 23:09.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you will see the -- the
threat of
a Clinton presidency will be so
great that

23:09.822 --> 23:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans will united behind
Mr. Trump.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just want to answer one
point about
Mr. Rubio being a conservative.
Look, he is

23:15.461 --> 23:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still for in-state tuition for
illegal aliens,
which he advocated for in
Florida. He's still

23:19.598 --> 23:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for amnesty. He just says, well,
we will secure
the border, then we will have
amnesty.

23:23.402 --> 23:28.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, he hasn't take a
conservative position
on this critically important
issue. And he

23:28.941 --> 23:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even deceived Florida voters
when he was running
against Charlie Crist, saying,
well, he's

23:32.144 --> 23:34.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be opposed to amnesty.
Then he came
in and give the opposite.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:36.682 --> 23:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: So, I think that's
-- well, he
told Florida voters that he was
against amnesty.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then he sponsored the amnesty
when he got
into the U.S. Senate.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I just want to make
the point
that, looking at exit polls last
night, not

23:43.656 --> 23:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of voters were listing
immigration as
their reason for supporting
Donald Trump.

23:48.694 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to -- we don't have a
lot of time
left. So, I want to ask Henry
Barbour about

23:52.197 --> 23:56.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this whole question about
contested elections,
and the general election and
whether in the

23:56.535 --> 24:00.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end Donald Trump is electable,
and, if he
is, whether he would get your
support ultimately

24:00.839 --> 24:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- could get your support.

24:03.475 --> 24:09.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY BARBOUR: Well, look, right
now, he's
getting the support of about 35
or so percent

24:09.381 --> 24:11.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Republicans.

24:11.183 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the majority of Republicans
right now
want somebody else. And I think
he would have

24:15.087 --> 24:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a hard time winning the general
election.
I have said consistently...

24:18.657 --> 24:19.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:19.358 --> 24:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HENRY BARBOUR: I'm sorry, Kris.

24:22.428 --> 24:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have said consistently that I
intend to
support the nominee. And that's
what I hope

24:28.167 --> 24:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do. I will say this. Mr.
Trump's comments
about the Klan the other day, as
a guy from

24:33.839 --> 24:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mississippi, I find that very
troubling. And
when he tries to pawn it off
that something

24:38.577 --> 24:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened with his earpiece, I
just find that
really hard to believe.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And maybe Kris can explain that.

24:45.884 --> 24:50.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH: Well, he's
disavowed it so many
times, and I find it kind of
strange when

24:50.189 --> 24:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans, who are constantly
falsely called
racists, suddenly take the
left's tactics

24:54.660 --> 24:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and start using it against
fellow Republicans.
Come on.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are all going to support
the candidate
at the end of the day. If Rubio
wins, which

24:59.565 --> 25:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think will happen, I
will be supporting
him.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, this is a
disagreement we're
not going to settle tonight, but
we will revisit

25:04.436 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kris Kobach, the Kansas
secretary of state,
Henry Barbour, member of the RNC
from Mississippi,

25:09.041 --> 25:10.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you both.

25:10.576 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: My pleasure.

25:16.048 --> 25:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HENRY BARBOUR: Thank you.

25:21.553 --> 25:25.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:25.190 --> 25:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": we
talk to U.N.
Ambassador Samantha Power about
the toughest

25:30.362 --> 25:35.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions on North Korea in 20
years; and
an out-of-this-world look at
Scott Kelly's

25:35.968 --> 25:38.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year in space.

25:38.537 --> 25:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first to the Supreme Court,
and perhaps
the biggest case of this term.

25:42.641 --> 25:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We pray for all of us to
have courage.

25:46.111 --> 25:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Activists on both
sides were
out in force, as the high court
heard its

25:50.749 --> 25:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first abortion case in almost a
decade.

25:54.319 --> 25:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: As a religious leader, I
believe that
every individual has the right
to make their

25:59.925 --> 26:00.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own moral decisions.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

26:02.661 --> 26:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Lives are precious to me,
even lives
conceived in rape, even
disabled, even kids

26:06.131 --> 26:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are suffering with multiple
surgeries
before they're five. Those kids
glorify God.

26:10.669 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the docket,
whether a Texas
law imposes an undue burden on
the right to

26:16.442 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obtain an abortion. The law
passed in 2013,
after a filibuster by then-state
Senator Wendy

26:24.450 --> 26:30.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Davis that drew national
attention. Abortion
clinics have to meet something
akin to hospital

26:30.889 --> 26:37.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standards and physicians must
have admitting
privileges at a hospital within
30 miles of

26:37.362 --> 26:38.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the clinic.

26:38.897 --> 26:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state says its purpose is
simply to protect
women's health.

26:42.167 --> 26:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT KELLER, Texas Solicitor
General: This
case is not about overturning
Roe vs. Wade.

26:46.472 --> 26:51.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What this case -- the issue in
this case is,
can Texas enact valid patient
regulations

26:51.743 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and improve safety? And when
over 210 women
annually are hospitalized due to
abortion,

26:58.684 --> 27:00.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Texas can.

27:00.519 --> 27:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But opponents say
more than
half of Texas' 41 abortion
clinics have closed

27:05.891 --> 27:12.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they can't meet the new
standards.
They say the law, known as HB-2,
is really

27:12.297 --> 27:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a backdoor way to stop
abortions.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY HAGSTROM MILLER, Whole
Woman's Health:
It has been a long and arduous
road that has

27:17.769 --> 27:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led us to this day, but that is
nothing compared
to what the women of Texas will
face if HB-2

27:24.343 --> 27:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not struck down. This law is
cruel and
it is harsh and it does nothing
to advance

27:30.949 --> 27:32.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
medial health for women.

27:32.851 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What the high
court will do
is even more of a guess than
usual, since

27:37.556 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the death of conservative
Justice Antonin
Scalia. If there's a 4-4 split,
a lower court

27:44.663 --> 27:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruling that affirmed the Texas
law may stand
for now.

27:51.136 --> 27:56.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we take a closer look inside
the court
now, with Marcia Coyle, chief
Washington correspondent

27:56.408 --> 27:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for "The National Law Journal."

27:58.176 --> 28:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia, so, abortion back in the
court after
a long, long spell of nine
years. How did

28:04.249 --> 28:05.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it all unfold today?

28:06.018 --> 28:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, as you explained, the
issue before the

28:09.354 --> 28:14.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
court is whether these
regulations create
an undue burden on a woman's
right to choose.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, if it does, they're
unconstitutional.

28:16.929 --> 28:23.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what does undue burden mean?
The Supreme
Court said in 1992 that an undue
burden is

28:23.302 --> 28:30.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unnecessary regulations with
having the purpose
or effect of presenting a
substantial obstacle

28:30.108 --> 28:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a woman seeking an abortion.

28:31.977 --> 28:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, during the arguments today,
first up was
the clinic's lawyer, and she
faced aggressive

28:37.883 --> 28:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and skeptical questioning by
Justice Alito
on the effect of these laws. He
didn't seem

28:44.256 --> 28:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
persuaded that the clinics had
presented hard
and sufficient evidence that the
laws, the

28:49.628 --> 28:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations at issue here were
-- really had
the effect of closing the
clinics that closed

28:55.734 --> 29:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or that the remaining clinics
had the capacity
-- did not have the capacity to
handle the

29:01.907 --> 29:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demand for abortions by Texas
women.

29:04.876 --> 29:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other side, Justices
Kagan, Sotomayor
and Ginsburg also had aggressive
skeptical

29:11.650 --> 29:17.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioning directed at Texas'
lawyer. There,
they focused on the purpose. Why
did Texas

29:17.889 --> 29:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do this? Texas says to protect
women's health.

29:21.760 --> 29:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Kagan, for example,
asked, well, listen,
abortion is considered one of
the safest medical

29:27.933 --> 29:35.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
procedures, outpatient
procedures today. In
fact, the risk is less than
liposuction. It's

29:35.307 --> 29:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less than some procedures in a
dentist's office.
Why don't those procedures
require being done

29:43.048 --> 29:45.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in ambulatory surgical
facilities?

29:45.350 --> 29:51.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, so much of
the focus today,
Marcia, was on Justice Anthony
Kennedy, seen

29:51.189 --> 29:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a swing vote, already a swing
vote, if
Justice Scalia were alive. Now
that he's gone,

29:57.896 --> 30:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're looking at an eight-member
court. What
role was Kennedy playing? What
was he saying

30:01.867 --> 30:02.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

30:02.367 --> 30:04.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: OK.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Kennedy suggested a
couple of things
here that are very interesting.
First, for

30:07.372 --> 30:12.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the clinic's lawyer, he's
picking up on Justice
Alito's questions about
evidence. He said,

30:12.844 --> 30:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would it be helpful if we sent
the case back
to the lower court, so that both
sides could

30:17.783 --> 30:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put in evidence on the effect of
these regulations?

30:21.286 --> 30:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we call a remand to
the lower
court. But he also said to the
Texas lawyer

30:25.657 --> 30:31.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the purpose here, could it be
having the
opposite effect? Could these
regulations actually

30:31.530 --> 30:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be increasing the number of
surgical late-term
abortions with higher risks?

30:38.336 --> 30:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he noted that, nationally,
abortions that
are done by drugs,
medically-induced abortions

30:44.943 --> 30:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are on the rise, but, in Texas
-- yes, they're
on the rise -- but, in Texas,
they are decreasing.

30:51.850 --> 30:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he offered maybe a way for
the court to
avoid a 4-4 split, which the
court generally

30:58.290 --> 31:00.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doesn't like to do.

31:00.125 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The consequences
of this case,
as we suggested, Marcia, are
bigger than just

31:04.596 --> 31:05.197 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Texas.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely.

31:06.898 --> 31:11.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though -- if the court were
to split
4-4, the ruling would only
pertain to the

31:11.903 --> 31:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states that are covered by the
Fifth Circuit,
these battles in courts are
going on all around

31:16.942 --> 31:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country. And I think both
sides were looking
to the Supreme Court for a
decision that would

31:22.714 --> 31:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resolve these battles. So it
does have implications
beyond Texas.

31:27.586 --> 31:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A sense just
quickly, Marcia,
of Scalia's absence. Has that
now -- how does

31:33.525 --> 31:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it feel, I guess I'm asking, in
the court?

31:35.327 --> 31:40.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It's very
noticeable because
he always was a very dominant
figure during

31:40.198 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the questioning.

31:42.134 --> 31:49.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly on the culture war
issues, including
abortion, his voice was always
heard. He also

31:49.307 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't believe that Roe v. Wade
was constitutional.
So, I think he clearly would
have been on

31:55.881 --> 31:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the side of Texas in upholding
these regulations.

31:58.683 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle in
the courtroom,
once again, thank you.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Judy.

32:03.955 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we get opposing
views from
two people who were also in the
room for today's

32:08.827 --> 32:12.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arguments, first Cecile
Richards, president
of Planned Parenthood, which
challenged the

32:12.798 --> 32:14.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Texas law.

32:14.666 --> 32:18.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ms. Richards, part of the
discussion in the
courtroom today was about undue
burden, about

32:18.670 --> 32:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether what the Texas law was
allowing would
place undue burden on women
seeking abortions.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did that play out for you,
for your argument?

32:28.513 --> 32:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILE RICHARDS, President,
Planned Parenthood:
Well, I thought it was very
clear, and particularly

32:31.283 --> 32:36.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the solicitor general made a
very good point.
He just put it quite succinctly.
He said,

32:36.555 --> 32:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if a woman has a right that she
can't exercise,
it really isn't a right.

32:41.927 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the case that was
made about what's
happened to women in Texas,
particularly women

32:46.364 --> 32:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who live in rural areas, who
live in areas
that are not covered or are
hundreds of miles

32:51.136 --> 32:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away from an abortion provider,
that is an
undue burden.

32:56.141 --> 33:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think on the flip side,
too, the state
was completely unable to make
the case that

33:00.378 --> 33:04.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was any medical benefit at
all to women
with the new restrictions that
have been put

33:04.416 --> 33:06.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in place.

33:06.251 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Justice Kennedy
expressed some
doubt today during these
arguments about whether

33:09.321 --> 33:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this shouldn't just be bounced
back to the
lower court. What effect would
that have on

33:13.225 --> 33:15.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your argument?

33:15.060 --> 33:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE RICHARDS: Well, I
don't know
-- there's obviously a very --
now that there's

33:17.462 --> 33:20.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only eight justices on the
court, I think
there are a lot of different
things that could

33:20.799 --> 33:22.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the women in Texas that are
suffering
right now, I think it's really
important that

33:25.270 --> 33:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this law be overturned, because
we see at
Planned Parenthood every day the
burdens that

33:29.908 --> 33:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women face to access safe and
legal abortion
care.

33:33.278 --> 33:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we know, dozens of centers
have closed
in the state of Texas already,
and I think

33:37.849 --> 33:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's time we actually restore
access in the
state. So I hope that, actually,
that the

33:41.720 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judges will hear, I think, the
voices of women,
which to me were very present in
the room

33:47.626 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, in the courtroom today,
and rule that
this is an unconstitutional law
and one that

33:52.097 --> 33:53.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs to be overturned.

33:53.899 --> 33:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But if there is a
4-4 decision
with the case, the court as it
is currently

33:58.937 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
configured, that would be a
defeat for you,
wouldn't it, upholding the
previous law?

34:04.209 --> 34:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE RICHARDS: It would
be a defeat
for the women of Texas,
absolutely.

34:07.312 --> 34:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really hope that's not
what happens.
I think that the lawyers made a
very compelling

34:12.150 --> 34:16.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, and the justices were
quite compelling
about what the burden has been
on women. And

34:16.888 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the state has made --
somehow made
-- tried to make the argument
that this was

34:20.558 --> 34:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the benefit of women's
health.

34:22.527 --> 34:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in fact, every reputable
national medical
organization, from the American
Medical Association

34:27.799 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the obstetricians and
gynecologists, to
family physicians, have said not
only are

34:33.939 --> 34:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these laws not beneficial for
women's health,
they do nothing to help women,
they actually

34:38.810 --> 34:43.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are harming women, because women
are delaying
care and making it much harder,
particularly

34:43.748 --> 34:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for women who are low-income in
the state
of Texas, to get access to a
safe and legal

34:47.419 --> 34:49.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
abortion.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You have alluded a
couple of times
to the burden on women, the
women of Texas.

34:51.156 --> 34:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Give me some examples of exactly
what would
happen or what has happened to
women seeking

34:56.795 --> 35:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abortions in these areas of the
state which
now don't have those facilities.

35:01.633 --> 35:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE RICHARDS: Well, we
have already
seen a report out of Texas that
tens of thousands

35:05.904 --> 35:08.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of women have tried to
self-induce abortions.

35:08.306 --> 35:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is -- for
anyone in this
country who remembers the days
before Roe

35:11.977 --> 35:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vs. Wade, when young and healthy
women were
dying in emergency rooms across
this country...

35:16.348 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How do we know that
has to do
with this law, though?

35:18.583 --> 35:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE RICHARDS: The fact
that women
-- because they haven't been
able to get access

35:21.152 --> 35:22.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to care.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will give you an example.
I was just
actually in Fort Worth, Texas,
this weekend,

35:26.558 --> 35:29.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a young woman came up to me.
And, fortunately,
she was able to get care, but
she said she

35:29.961 --> 35:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to drive 400 miles because
she lived in
deep West Texas, and there was
no other provider.

35:35.400 --> 35:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the state today admitted
that the lack
of a health care provider in El
Paso meant

35:39.871 --> 35:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women were driving to other
states. And I
think one of the things, Gwen,
that didn't

35:43.408 --> 35:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come up today, but I think is
really important,
is this case is not just about
Texas, because

35:48.046 --> 35:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're already seeing in the
state of Louisiana
a similar law that is causing
now the closure

35:52.817 --> 35:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of other women's health centers
in Louisiana.

35:55.053 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ironically, women have been
driving from Texas
to Louisiana to have access to
an abortion

36:00.592 --> 36:06.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provider. Now, if you end access
in Louisiana
and Texas, and then soon
Mississippi, you're

36:06.564 --> 36:10.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about a whole area of
the country
where potentially women will not
have access

36:10.869 --> 36:12.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to abortion services.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's been a while
since we have
seen an abortion debate at the
high court.

36:15.607 --> 36:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does this compare to, say,
the partial-birth
abortion ban debate in 2007?

36:21.446 --> 36:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE RICHARDS: Well, I
think two
things that were really striking
to me.

36:24.749 --> 36:28.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, of course, is that the
state has argued
that this is somehow to benefit
women's health.

36:28.586 --> 36:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it was clearly
stated today there
is zero evidence that in fact it
is about

36:32.991 --> 36:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women's health, and it actually
has been devastating
for women.

36:36.461 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that really
struck me was
the difference of having three
women on the

36:40.265 --> 36:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court. I think that all
the justices
obviously are important in that
court, but

36:45.670 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it really makes a difference to
begin to have
a court that more reflects the
diversity of

36:49.441 --> 36:55.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country, and I think women
who can really
speak from a woman's point of
view, just how

36:55.380 --> 37:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impactful these kind of laws
that specifically
target women and women's access
to health

37:00.652 --> 37:03.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care, how impactful they are.

37:03.588 --> 37:06.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was really grateful to
have the women's
voices in the room.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Cecile Richards,
president of
Planned Parenthood, thank you.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BO /CECILE RICHARDS: Good to
see you,
Gwen.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now the other
side.

37:13.264 --> 37:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clarke Forsythe is acting
president and senior
counsel for the anti-abortion
rights group

37:18.236 --> 37:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans United for Life.

37:20.205 --> 37:26.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I was just asking Cecile
Richards from Planned
Parenthood about the undue
burden argument.

37:26.544 --> 37:30.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the argument in which
they are challenging
whether this law, this Texas law
should be

37:30.715 --> 37:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
upheld -- what -- or overruled.

37:32.784 --> 37:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think about the
argument that
there is an undue burden being
placed on women?

37:36.754 --> 37:37.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLARKE FORSYTHE, Acting
President and Senior
Counsel, Americans United for
Life: There

37:37.288 --> 37:39.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is no undue burden.

37:39.090 --> 37:43.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are very important medical
regulations,
very important health and safety
regulations.

37:43.628 --> 37:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have to be ambulatory
surgical treatment
standards. And you would want
every clinic

37:50.135 --> 37:52.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to meet those standards.

37:52.203 --> 37:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every part of those standards
has a medical
logic and a grounding in medical
practice.

37:57.976 --> 38:03.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Donna Campbell was a state
senator who
testified in support of these
regulations

38:03.648 --> 38:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Texas Senate, 23 years an
emergency
room physician, and she
testified to the medical

38:09.521 --> 38:14.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
logic behind every part of the
ambulatory
surgical standards, ASC
standards.

38:14.192 --> 38:21.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also an absolute
medical logic behind
admitting privileges. It
involves continuity

38:21.833 --> 38:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of care between the performing
surgeon and
the receiving surgeon in any
hospital if there

38:27.205 --> 38:29.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are complications.

38:29.040 --> 38:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wouldn't want to go to a
clinic that didn't
meet ASC standards. You wouldn't
want to go

38:34.412 --> 38:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a clinic in which the doctor
didn't have
admitting privileges. I wouldn't
want my wife

38:39.184 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or one of my five daughters to
go to any clinic
that didn't meet these
standards.

38:43.454 --> 38:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is the argument
before the court
about medical logic or medical
standards,

38:48.793 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or is it about access for rights
that women
under the Constitution or under
the laws that

38:55.733 --> 38:57.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
currently exist already have?

38:57.402 --> 38:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: There is no
right to an unsafe
abortion.

38:59.971 --> 39:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Access doesn't mean anything if
it's not safe,
and you have safety for patients
by meeting

39:05.910 --> 39:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical standards. These are
pervasive. ASC
standards are pervasive across
the country.

39:10.381 --> 39:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real question in this case
is, why are
these generally applicable
longstanding standards

39:17.922 --> 39:22.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not applicable to abortion
clinics?

39:22.060 --> 39:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Supreme Court for 43
years since Roe
vs. Wade has never allowed
states to pass

39:29.500 --> 39:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health and safety regulations in
the first
trimester, when 90 percent are
done. This

39:33.004 --> 39:37.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a landmark case, because the
has not permitted
that. The court is the national
abortion control

39:37.508 --> 39:39.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
board.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They control standards in every
clinic, in
every state from coast to coast,
and they

39:42.614 --> 39:48.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have never allowed health and
safety regulations
in the first trimester. This is
a landmark

39:48.052 --> 39:49.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

39:49.787 --> 39:54.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How different is the
-- are the
options now for you with a 4-4
court with

39:54.225 --> 39:59.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Scalia's absence? Does
it change what
you expect the outcome to be?

39:59.931 --> 40:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: Well, based on
what I heard
in the courtroom today, I think
the most likely

40:04.535 --> 40:07.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
result is a 4-4 split.

40:07.305 --> 40:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has happened before in an
abortion case
during the Bork vacancy, before
Justice Kennedy

40:11.276 --> 40:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was confirmed in 1988. And a 4-4
split means
the lower court's decision is
what is called

40:19.017 --> 40:20.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affirmed by an equally divided
court.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It means the lower court's
decision stands,
and in this case...

40:22.520 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which would be a
victory for you.

40:24.689 --> 40:27.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: And in this
case, a victory
for Texas, a victory for patient
care in Texas,

40:27.759 --> 40:30.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but it wouldn't have
applicability to any
other state.

40:30.862 --> 40:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so most likely, the court
would have to
revisit this issue in 2017 or
2018.

40:35.099 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Justice Kennedy was
apparently
musing aloud today in the court
about the

40:38.970 --> 40:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possibility of just sending this
back to the
lower court again.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: That's a
possibility.

40:45.076 --> 40:51.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But if Justice Kennedy
scrupulously applies
his 2007 opinion in Gonzales vs.
Carhart for

40:51.616 --> 40:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five justices, he will uphold
these standards,
because you don't get two bites
at the apple

40:57.922 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to make claims and then
repeatedly make claims.

41:00.425 --> 41:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The clinics had all the time in
the world
to make their claims and all the
time in the

41:04.429 --> 41:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world to put their facts in
about the burden
of these things, and they failed
to.

41:08.766 --> 41:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The 2007 -- I just
want to clear
it up -- the 2007 decision you
just referred

41:12.737 --> 41:14.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to is the partial-birth abortion
ban.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: Yes.

41:16.374 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How different is the
situation
now, in 2016, than it was in
2007, when the

41:21.746 --> 41:23.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court acted on that?

41:23.648 --> 41:27.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: Well, if the
court scrupulously
applies the standards in 2007,
they should

41:27.418 --> 41:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uphold these regulations.

41:29.187 --> 41:33.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a unique case,
because it's the
first time the court has had a
solid record

41:33.858 --> 41:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of facts on -- in protecting
maternal health.
And the court has never had that
before. I

41:42.633 --> 41:48.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was hoping -- I hope it's
eye-opening for
the court to see the need for
health and safety

41:48.206 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations, the short-term and
long-term
risks, and the fact that access
doesn't mean

41:52.977 --> 41:56.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
anything if you have got
substandard conditions
and substandard providers.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why these standards
are so important.

41:59.283 --> 42:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clarke Forsythe,
president, acting
president of Americans United
for Life, thank

42:05.723 --> 42:08.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

42:08.993 --> 42:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLARKE FORSYTHE: Thanks, Gwen.

42:13.398 --> 42:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, as we
reported earlier,
the United Nations Security
Council unanimously

42:20.605 --> 42:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approved new sanctions against
North Korea
this morning. The sanctions
would affect many

42:25.743 --> 42:31.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sectors of North Korea's
economy, and were
designed to further limit its
nuclear program

42:31.382 --> 42:36.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after another bomb test in
January and a missile
launch last month.

42:36.521 --> 42:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. ambassador to the U.N.,
Samantha
Power, was instrumental in
getting these sanctions

42:41.359 --> 42:43.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
approved. And she joins me now.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ambassador Power, welcome to the
program.

42:46.063 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is, as you know, a
notoriously defiant
regime. Why will these sanctions
move them

42:52.003 --> 42:53.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in any useful way?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: Well, they are, as you
indicated,

42:55.640 --> 43:00.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the toughest and most
comprehensive sanctions
ever imposed on North Korea, of
course, but

43:00.878 --> 43:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also the toughest imposed by the
U.N. in more
than 20 years.

43:05.149 --> 43:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, there are measures
in this package
of sanctions that have never
been done in

43:09.287 --> 43:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the whole history of the U.N.
So, for starters,
we have turned the dial up not
just a notch,

43:16.027 --> 43:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but many, many, many, many
notches.

43:17.829 --> 43:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the degree of isolation, the
degree -- the
impediments to them actually
pursuing the

43:24.435 --> 43:28.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technology, the know-how, the
money, so many
channels that they have been
using to evade

43:28.606 --> 43:32.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prior sanctions regimes have now
been cut
off with this resolution.

43:32.410 --> 43:36.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're hopeful, also, Judy,
that -- you
know, China went along with this
resolution,

43:37.014 --> 43:41.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with these unprecedented
measures. And I think
that's a measure of China's
frustration with

43:41.352 --> 43:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the regime. And it's its own
signal, on top
of the practical effect of these
sanctions.

43:46.624 --> 43:50.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A very important message has
been sent, not
only by the international
community, but by

43:50.928 --> 43:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea's very influential
neighbor, and,
of course, by the United States.

43:53.898 --> 44:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the U.S. is
confident that
China is going to be every bit
as aggressive

44:00.171 --> 44:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as these sanctions spell out in
enforcing
these?

44:03.140 --> 44:08.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to ask you about
that, because
some of the terms here sound
like they're

44:08.079 --> 44:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very difficult to implement.
Inspecting all
the goods that go into and come
out of North

44:14.051 --> 44:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Korea, how do you do that?

44:15.786 --> 44:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, each
country is going
to have to come up with its own
inspection

44:18.756 --> 44:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regime. That's why you're right
to point to
the fact that every member state
has a responsibility

44:22.527 --> 44:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do this in as airtight a way
as possible.

44:25.496 --> 44:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Be just to signal the contrast
between where
are now, as of today's
resolution, vs. where

44:29.734 --> 44:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were yesterday, yesterday, in
order for
a state to have an obligation to
inspect cargo

44:35.406 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going into or out of DPRK, they
actually had
to have credible information
that there was

44:39.877 --> 44:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something traveling in that
cargo that had
a nexus with a ballistic missile
program or

44:44.215 --> 44:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a nuclear weapons program.

44:46.050 --> 44:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a bit of a needle in a
haystack. It's
hard to get intelligence of that
granularity

44:49.387 --> 44:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then get it to people who
might inspect
in time. Now the presumption has
totally shifted,

44:54.358 --> 45:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where all cargo going into the
DPRK is suspected,
frankly, of being used to
service this program,

45:01.098 --> 45:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which they have advanced over
the years, and
every country is now going to
have to put

45:04.502 --> 45:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in place mechanisms to ensure
that that cargo
gets looked at.

45:07.638 --> 45:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will have means of
assessing whether
or not states are in compliance,
and we will

45:12.009 --> 45:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course increase the political
costs and
bring to the sanctions committee
and so forth

45:15.746 --> 45:18.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
anybody who seems to be
deviating from the
requirements of the new
resolution.

45:18.883 --> 45:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what will the
measure be
of whether these sanctions are
working?

45:22.086 --> 45:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, that's a
great question.

45:24.121 --> 45:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for starters, as I
mentioned, the
resolution is about actually
blocking stuff

45:31.829 --> 45:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming into North Korea and
blocking their
ability to traffic in coal, in
iron ore, in

45:38.135 --> 45:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gold, and to use those proceeds
in order to
again acquire technologies,
dual-use and just

45:44.475 --> 45:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
straight-up technologies that
they have used
to advance the program.

45:46.944 --> 45:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is just almost an
incapacitation
function. And when we see that
it's harder

45:51.682 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them to acquire materials,
that they can't
advance their program in the
same way, that

45:57.321 --> 46:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to be one sign that the
resolution
is biting.

46:00.424 --> 46:04.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other, of course, and the
ultimate objective
here is for them to come to the
negotiating

46:04.195 --> 46:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
table, but not just come to want
to talk about
whatever is on their agenda --
and they have

46:08.499 --> 46:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few things they would like to
talk about
-- but to talk about
denuclearization, to

46:12.169 --> 46:16.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
talk about irreversible,
complete, verifiable
denuclearization.

46:16.807 --> 46:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is something they have
not been prepared
to talk about in more than 10
years.

46:20.111 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
quickly about
one or two other important
international issues.

46:25.249 --> 46:30.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one has to do with Syria,
the recent cessation
of hostilities agreement. It's
been reported

46:30.221 --> 46:36.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's now been a number of
violations, including
by the Assad regime using
chemical weapons

46:36.227 --> 46:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in recent days. Assuming that is
true, how
much is the United States
prepared to tolerate

46:44.869 --> 46:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from whether it's Assad or any
of the other
parties in order to say that
this -- before

46:51.475 --> 46:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you say, frankly, that this
agreement isn't
working?

46:53.878 --> 46:58.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, much like
the resolution
we passed today on North Korea,
we have, over

46:58.783 --> 47:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the course of the last year,
done something
very concrete on chemical
weapons, not only

47:02.820 --> 47:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
removing and destroying the
declared chemical
weapons program by the regime,
but also creating

47:07.858 --> 47:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an accountability mechanism
where the OPCW
and the U.N. go out and actually
investigate

47:13.431 --> 47:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allegations of the kind that we
saw made by,
again, some high-level public
comments.

47:18.469 --> 47:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We ourselves are looking into
the report of
chlorine use. It wouldn't be the
first time,

47:24.041 --> 47:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if the regime had used chlorine,
but it would
be in blatant violation of the
cessation of

47:28.045 --> 47:31.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hostilities, and it would be
something that
we would expect Russia, as the
backer of the

47:31.916 --> 47:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian regime, to hold the
regime accountable
for and to make sure that that
practice stopped,

47:37.388 --> 47:41.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as we then pursued
accountability for any
perpetrator of such an attack.

47:41.625 --> 47:45.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, we can't confirm it.
What we do
know is that there have been
other forms of

47:45.296 --> 47:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violations, attacks in the
northwestern part
of the country. And, you know,
this is not

47:50.768 --> 47:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a perfect environment for a
cessation of hostilities.
We don't have a big monitoring
presence on

47:54.238 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ground. We don't have a
political agreement,
where a cessation of hostilities
accompanies

47:58.142 --> 47:58.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a political agreement.

47:58.809 --> 48:00.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

48:00.778 --> 48:04.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: So we never
expected it was
going be perfect, but I think
this U.S./Russia/ISSG

48:04.048 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- so-called ISSG channel -- is
where we seek
to in a way adjudicate these
things and then

48:08.919 --> 48:14.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get those who back the parties
to put pressure
on the parties to get them to
stop.

48:14.125 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think there has been a
reduction in violence
that's noteworthy, because it
also helps us

48:17.595 --> 48:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get humanitarian assistance in.
But we have
got to see a more sustained
cessation of hostilities

48:21.999 --> 48:25.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and these violations stop, if
this thing is
to give us the momentum we need
for the political

48:25.703 --> 48:27.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
track.

48:27.571 --> 48:30.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very question,
final question
on the refugees pouring or
trying to get into

48:30.608 --> 48:32.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Europe from the Middle East.

48:32.843 --> 48:37.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been telling their story
day after
day. As you know, the top U.S.
general of

48:37.381 --> 48:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO, Philip -- General Philip
Breedlove,
said the other day that he
believes that ISIS

48:41.452 --> 48:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is now spreading, in his words,
like a cancer
among these refugees. Is that
your understanding

48:47.591 --> 48:49.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of what's going on now?

48:49.460 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, I mean, I
think that,
certainly, we have seen, you
know, ISIS turning

48:56.834 --> 49:00.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in European cities. We have
seen the Paris
attacks.

49:00.104 --> 49:05.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lot of homegrown
extremism, people
who are first-generation who
have been born

49:05.476 --> 49:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in European countries who have
taken to extremism.
I think what's important is that
the systems

49:10.147 --> 49:15.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have to process people,
most of whom,
the vast, vast, vast majority of
whom, are

49:15.252 --> 49:20.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just in desperate need of
refuge, that the
systems we have are sufficient
to actually

49:20.491 --> 49:25.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being able -- be able to run
fingerprint checks,
you know, look into backgrounds
and so forth.

49:25.396 --> 49:28.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's the great
disadvantage of this
flood is, it's been much harder
for Europe

49:28.833 --> 49:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to manage than, for instance,
our program,
where we're able to actually
deliberate over

49:33.237 --> 49:37.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these refugee files for 18
months to make
sure we get it right.

49:37.041 --> 49:39.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going
to leave
it there.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We very much appreciate your
talking with
us.

49:41.412 --> 49:42.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Thank you.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. Ambassador
to the U.N.
Samantha Power.

49:45.549 --> 49:54.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Thank you.

49:54.425 --> 50:02.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight:
what's it like
to live in space for a year.

50:02.433 --> 50:06.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what astronaut Scott
Kelly has been
doing on the International Space
Station.

50:06.770 --> 50:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the focus of a special on
PBS tonight
called "A Year in Space."

50:11.408 --> 50:17.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Kelly was actually up
there for 340
days before he descended by
capsule into Kazakstan

50:17.615 --> 50:22.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday. It was the longest
any American
has been in space, and part of
an effort to

50:22.620 --> 50:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see how the body and mind fare
over time.

50:26.290 --> 50:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA hopes to get astronauts to
Mars in another
two decades. And it will take
2.5 years to

50:31.495 --> 50:38.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get there. Throughout his
mission, Scott Kelly
has circled the Earth more than
5,400 times,

50:38.102 --> 50:45.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traveling 143 million miles and
witnessed
thousands of sunrises, sunsets
and other incredible

50:45.109 --> 50:46.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
views.

50:46.944 --> 50:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have put together our own
compilation of
some of what Kelly's seen and
said from start

50:51.248 --> 50:52.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to finish.

50:52.750 --> 51:06.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Do you consider yourself
and Mikhail
pathfinders of sorts?

51:06.630 --> 51:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT KELLY, NASA Astronaut:
Sure. I guess
you could use that term, but I
think we all

51:16.674 --> 51:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT KELLY, NASA Astronaut:
Sure. I guess
you could use that term, but I
think we all

51:27.818 --> 51:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, you know, all the crew
members over the
last 15 years and even those who
came before

51:36.026 --> 51:37.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

51:37.962 --> 51:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, flying in space is a
process. Exploring
space is a process that you take
step by step.

51:45.569 --> 51:51.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, on one hand, you
know, Misha
and I might be at the front of
that right

51:51.508 --> 51:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now because we have spent, you
know, a pretty
significant amount of time up
here, but that

51:58.315 --> 52:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in no way takes away from
anything that all
the previous folks have done,
you know, towards

52:06.757 --> 52:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that future goal of going to
Mars.

52:10.594 --> 52:17.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I'm a big believer in
what we're
doing here. I believe in the
importance of

52:17.568 --> 52:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flying in space. And, you know,
the research
we do, I believe in exploration,
and I will

52:24.875 --> 52:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
miss being on the front lines of
that endeavor,
I guess.

52:30.047 --> 52:35.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, on the one hand, I
look forward
to going home, but it's
something that has

52:35.152 --> 52:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a big part of my life, and
I'm going
to miss it.

52:41.158 --> 52:51.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you definitely have a
different
perspective on the Earth and
things that happen

52:51.635 --> 52:58.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down there. I keep probably more
in touch
with what's going on, on Earth
when I'm in

52:58.409 --> 53:00.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
space than when I'm actually on
Earth.

53:00.344 --> 53:06.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you definitely have a sense
of -- a heightened
sense of empathy and also, you
know, notice,

53:06.417 --> 53:15.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the effects of our
presence on the
planet. It makes you somewhat,
if you weren't

53:15.559 --> 53:25.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already, an environmentalist,
and, you know,
definitely a feeling that we
need to take

53:25.803 --> 53:35.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care of it.

53:35.079 --> 53:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Just spectacular.

53:42.219 --> 53:47.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can watch more about Scott
Kelly's mission
tonight. "A Year in Space" airs
on PBS stations.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All I can say is
wow.

53:50.227 --> 53:52.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

53:52.362 --> 53:54.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:54.231 --> 53:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

53:58.335 --> 54:07.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
