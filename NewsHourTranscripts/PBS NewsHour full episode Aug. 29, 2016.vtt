GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: the
backlash against the EpiPen
price hike -- why

00:12.179 --> 00:17.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the drugmaker suddenly decided
to offer a
cheaper generic version of the
lifesaving

00:17.217 --> 00:18.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

The murder of a mother of four
is the latest

00:22.356 --> 00:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

brought on by violence in
Chicago.

00:26.560 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And from supporting
al-Qaida to
a life of academia -- how a
former extremist

00:32.699 --> 00:37.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is joining counterterrorism
efforts from a
perch at George Washington

LORENZO VIDINO, George
Washington University:
This analysis will come from the
inside, firsthand

00:41.608 --> 00:46.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from somebody who has lived it
and has played
a prominent role in that scene.

Turkey today over its military
drive against

01:05.766 --> 01:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kurdish forces in Northern
Syria.

01:08.302 --> 01:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish tanks and planes are
backing Syrian
rebels in attacks on the Kurds,
who are supported

01:13.573 --> 01:15.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the U.S.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense Secretary Ash Carter

ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: American

01:22.416 --> 01:29.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are -- we, like they, want to
combat ISIL,
and we want -- we're calling on
them all now.

01:29.456 --> 01:37.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's keep our priorities clear

them to deconflict, so to speak,
on the battlefield.

President Recep

the Kurdish

01:40.500 --> 01:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group is an arm of the Islamic
State.

01:42.903 --> 01:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the White House
announced President
Obama will meet with Erdogan on

into a gathering

01:54.314 --> 01:56.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of military recruits.

01:56.149 --> 02:01.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State group claimed
the attack,
in the southern city of Aden,
near two schools

02:01.054 --> 02:02.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and a mosque.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials said the attacker
drove through
a gate and exploded a pickup
truck.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition to the dead, nearly

surge of sailings.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The mostly African migrants were
trying to

in effect in Colombia.

02:30.550 --> 02:35.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

today, after the government and
leftist FARC

02:35.622 --> 02:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebels agreed to end 52 years of

HARI SREENIVASAN: Brazil's
suspended President
Dilma Rousseff proclaimed her
innocence today

02:46.600 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at her impeachment trial.

02:48.335 --> 02:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said the effort to oust her
on charges
of breaking budget rules amounts
to a coup.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rousseff choked back tears
during her speech,
and charged that the country's
economic elite

02:56.843 --> 02:58.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want her overthrown.

02:58.745 --> 03:02.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DILMA ROUSSEFF, Brazilian
President (through

these accusations

03:02.783 --> 03:07.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against me, I cannot stop
feeling in my mouth
the sharp and bitter taste of
injustice.

03:08.021 --> 03:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't expect me to be silent
against cowards,
who in the past used weapons,
and today aimed

03:12.893 --> 03:15.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to undermine democracy and the
rule of law.

03:15.095 --> 03:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Brazilian

remove Rousseff

03:19.132 --> 03:20.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

Food and Drug Administration
granted fast-track

03:24.938 --> 03:28.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approval of a test to detect the
Zika virus.

03:28.341 --> 03:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

to screen patients who have
symptoms of Zika,

03:33.447 --> 03:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and to screen donated blood.

03:35.282 --> 03:39.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, about 2,500 cases of

Hillary Clinton's vice chair is
leaving her

03:43.857 --> 03:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
husband over reports that he
sent sexual text
messages to another woman again.

03:48.728 --> 03:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Huma Abedin married
then-Congressman Anthony
Weiner in 2010.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's repeatedly been accused
of so-called
sexting.

03:56.703 --> 04:00.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump claimed
today that
Weiner had access to government
secrets through

04:00.173 --> 04:01.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Abedin.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said it shows Clinton's bad
judgment.

04:03.276 --> 04:07.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bank stocks led Wall

amid talk of higher interest
rates.

04:07.714 --> 04:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average

HARI SREENIVASAN: And two deaths
of note:
The Latin music world mourned
today for Juan

04:21.862 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gabriel, Mexico's top-selling
singer-songwriter.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He died of a heart attack on
Sunday.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gabriel's ballads about love and
heartbreak
often paired with a full
mariachi band were

04:31.538 --> 04:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widely popular throughout Latin
America and
with Spanish speakers in the
U.S. Juan Gabriel

04:36.209 --> 04:37.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was 66 years old.

04:37.844 --> 04:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And actor Gene
Wilder died last
night at his home in
Connecticut.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had Alzheimer's disease.

04:43.717 --> 04:49.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had major hits in the 1960s
and 1970s with
"The Producers," Blazing
Saddles," and "Young

04:49.389 --> 04:51.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Frankenstein."

04:51.091 --> 04:55.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was the lead in the 1971
version of
"Willy Wonka and the Charlie
Factory."

04:55.328 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE WILDER, Actor (singing):
There is no
life I know to compare with pure
imagination.

05:08.441 --> 05:18.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Living there, you will be free,
if you truly
wish to be.

05:18.485 --> 05:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Living there, you will be free,
if you truly
wish to be.

05:24.558 --> 05:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Gene Wilder was 83
years old.

05:30.096 --> 05:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
EpiPen goes generic, the role
social media

05:34.501 --> 05:40.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
played in the price drop; we
examine another
violent and murderous weekend in
Chicago;

05:40.707 --> 05:49.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Washington University's
new hire, a
convicted extremist; and much
more.

05:49.249 --> 06:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Drugmaker Mylan has
been under
heavy fire for its soaring price
hikes for

06:01.394 --> 06:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EpiPens, the lifesaving
necessity for those
with serious allergic reactions.

06:06.266 --> 06:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its price has skyrocketed to as
much as $600
for a set of two.

06:11.438 --> 06:16.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At first, Mylan offered
financial assistance
to customers, but after mounting
pressure,

06:16.376 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the company said it now will
release a generic
a version for half the price.

06:20.880 --> 06:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To give us some perspective on
how this case
is different, Stephen
Schondelmeyer studies

06:26.186 --> 06:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this closely at the University
of Minnesota,
and Andrew Pollack covers
pharmaceuticals

06:30.257 --> 06:31.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The New York Times.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome.

06:33.593 --> 06:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andrew Pollack, I want to start
with you and
ask you to explain just
basically, what's

06:36.263 --> 06:38.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the difference here?

06:38.198 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the big deal between a
generic EpiPen
and the kind that this company
has been producing

06:42.102 --> 06:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and selling at such a markup?

06:44.204 --> 06:48.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW POLLACK, The New York
Times: Well,
it's actually quite a bit
confusing.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The products are exactly the
same.

06:50.610 --> 06:51.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the same product.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, they are calling one
version now
a generic.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will have a different package
on it.

06:57.450 --> 07:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It won't say EpiPen, and they
will be selling
it for half the list price of
the branded

07:04.124 --> 07:05.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
product.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has that ever
happened before?

07:06.993 --> 07:12.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW POLLACK: Well,
pharmaceutical companies,
brand-name pharmaceutical
companies often

07:12.732 --> 07:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do introduce their own generic
version of
their own drug.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called an authorized
generic.

07:21.775 --> 07:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is done once an outside
generic company
comes into the market.

07:27.380 --> 07:34.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This allows them to keep some of
the sales,
rather than having all their
sales being lost

07:34.921 --> 07:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the outside generic company.

07:36.756 --> 07:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is unusual here is that
Mylan doesn't
have an immediate genetic
competitor for the

07:44.130 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
EpiPen.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So they're basically
competing
against public relations at this
point.

07:47.967 --> 07:54.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stephen Schondelmeyer, how did a
product that
cost as little as $100 in 2007
rise to $600

07:54.140 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

07:55.975 --> 07:59.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN SCHONDELMEYER,
University of Minnesota:
Well, it did that because the
marketplace

07:59.612 --> 08:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't have any regulation,
either government
regulation or market regulation,
that holds

08:07.287 --> 08:09.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that down.

08:09.255 --> 08:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, this product that
-- at a self-insured
employer I work with, it cost
them $100 for

08:16.029 --> 08:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this product in 2011, and today
is costing
them $730.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That dramatic increase just
isn't seen.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now they're calling it a
generic in name.

08:26.673 --> 08:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's not a generic, meaning
an independent
economic decision-maker choosing
to compete

08:31.544 --> 08:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the price of the brand
name.

08:32.979 --> 08:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we won't see this behave like
a normal
generic in the market either.

08:37.450 --> 08:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And even if it's
half the price,
it will be still around $300,
which is still

08:41.654 --> 08:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than it was just a short
time ago, right?

08:44.824 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN SCHONDELMEYER: Sure,
it's more than
$200 than it was not too long
ago.

08:51.731 --> 08:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is sort of like if your
child happens
to get kidnapped, and the
kidnappers call

08:56.336 --> 09:00.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you and say we will cut the
ransom in half,
so you're going to save half the
money.

09:00.907 --> 09:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure you would call that
a savings.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Andrew Pollack, how
did this study
get so much attention?

09:05.912 --> 09:09.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It feels like we weren't talking
about this
at all a couple of weeks ago,
and the numbers

09:09.449 --> 09:11.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were just as high then.

09:11.317 --> 09:18.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW POLLACK: Yes, I think
it's partly the
back-to-school season is the
peak buying season

09:18.925 --> 09:20.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for these products.

09:20.760 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, you had many parents
buy more than
in the past, having high
deductible insurance

09:29.803 --> 09:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plans, where, having not met
their deductibles,
they had to pay the entire
price.

09:35.809 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This started spreading on social
media, and
a big furor arose.

09:41.281 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, social media was
the driving
force behind this furor, this
uprising, as

09:46.986 --> 09:48.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it were?

09:48.822 --> 09:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW POLLACK: Yes, we -- my
colleague Tara
had an article on this a couple
of days ago.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tara Parker-Pope,
right.

09:56.129 --> 09:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stephen Schondelmeyer, I want to
ask you a
little bit about how this could
have been

09:59.766 --> 10:01.501 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
avoided.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could this, for instance -- the
first thing
that Mylan did was offer coupons
to reduce

10:04.737 --> 10:06.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the price.

10:06.206 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, today, they have talked
about making
available a generic version.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there anything other thing
they could have
done to bring this price down,
or was this

10:13.680 --> 10:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
simply a force of the markets?

10:15.648 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN SCHONDELMEYER: Well, I
think Mylan
could have avoided raising it so
dramatically

10:21.287 --> 10:23.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first place.

10:23.089 --> 10:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a product they have been
raising 9.9
percent at a time for two or
three times a

10:28.127 --> 10:29.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

10:29.896 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then in the last two years,
they started
raising it 14.9 percent at a
time for one

10:34.567 --> 10:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or two or three times a year.

10:36.569 --> 10:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The marketplace isn't going up
that rapidly
in terms of inflation, and most
people and

10:41.074 --> 10:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their resources don't go up that
much.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they come back and say,
well, this
is covered by insurance, so what
are people

10:46.913 --> 10:48.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worried about?

10:48.281 --> 10:52.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, nobody -- the insurance
company doesn't
pay for this drug.

10:52.185 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The insurance company bills
somebody for the
drug and pays pharmacies for it,
but the insurance

10:57.390 --> 10:59.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
company just processes
transactions.

10:59.659 --> 11:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, premiums for insurance are
out-of-pocket
costs also, and they seem to
have ignored

11:05.498 --> 11:07.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, you mentioned
the insurance
companies and the high
deductibles.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Andrew Pollack, you mentioned it
as well.

11:10.436 --> 11:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much is this driven -- the
company says
this is driven in part by the
high-deductible

11:14.507 --> 11:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care plans and that is
where the problem
lies, not the pricing structure
they create

11:20.079 --> 11:21.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the drug.

11:21.915 --> 11:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW POLLACK: Well, this has
been sort of
a perennial battle between the
pharmaceutical

11:26.386 --> 11:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies, not just Mylan, and
the insurers,
each blaming the other.

11:33.826 --> 11:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in defense of the insurance
companies,
I mean, they say they have to
take some measures

11:38.831 --> 11:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because the price keeps going
up.

11:42.569 --> 11:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's part of the playbook of
all the drug
companies, especially those with
high-priced

11:48.274 --> 11:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drugs, to try to cushion the
consumer and,
you know, bill the insurance
company.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This does seem like
we're kind
of chasing our tails here.

11:59.352 --> 12:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is one -- there is the
price, which
drives the insurance, which
drives the price,

12:03.823 --> 12:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and caught in the middle of all
this is the
person who's trying to make use
of the drug.

12:08.227 --> 12:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Stephen Schondelmeyer, let
me ask you
something about why this one.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard lots of talk
before, and on
this program, we have talked
about the high

12:15.835 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cost of pharmaceuticals.

12:17.737 --> 12:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it because this is something
which is used
for children, and that has
gotten people angry

12:22.508 --> 12:24.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a different way?

12:24.344 --> 12:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN SCHONDELMEYER: Well, I
think partly
because it's used for children
and also because

12:28.781 --> 12:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is literally a drug about
life and death.

12:32.218 --> 12:37.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't have it, there's a
high probability
a patient could die without
access to this

12:37.657 --> 12:39.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drug.

12:39.459 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, this is a drug that you
have to have
on hand to prevent a problem, so
the patient

12:44.130 --> 12:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may have to have one or two
doses at home,
one at their cabin up north, one
or two doses

12:49.836 --> 12:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at school, and a school may have
40 or 50
EpiPens.

12:55.308 --> 13:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, technically, right now, the
nurse can't
use one patient's EpiPen for
another patient.

13:01.447 --> 13:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we may need to look at some
alternative
policies of how these are used
at schools,

13:05.852 --> 13:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much like we have with the
Naloxone, that
these become readily available,
and they could

13:10.056 --> 13:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a supply at the school on
hand, and use
it for whoever needs it at the
time, rather

13:15.161 --> 13:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than each patient having to have
one.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, this is about so
much more
than price.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Stephen Schondelmeyer
at the University
of Minnesota and Andrew Pollack
of The New

13:22.969 --> 13:29.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
York Times, thank you both very
much.

13:29.709 --> 13:44.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Across the
country, students
are heading back to school.

13:44.257 --> 13:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As on many campuses, today is
also the first
day of class at George
Washington University.

13:49.128 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This summer, a think tank at the
school made
one of the most unique hires in
academia.

13:53.700 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour" has a broadcast
exclusive interview
with a man who was once
convicted of terrorism-related

13:59.138 --> 14:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charges, and is now a researcher
on campus.

14:02.108 --> 14:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I caught up with Jesse Curtis
Morton recently.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is Jesse Curtis Morton.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2010, he went by another
name, Younus Abdullah
Muhammad.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON, George
Washington University:
We will fight you and destroy
you if we have

14:15.455 --> 14:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, but we prefer that you come
home and pack
it up.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stop killing our innocent men,
women and children
overseas.

14:21.027 --> 14:25.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Born in the
U.S., he grew
up in Pennsylvania and New
Jersey, but Morton

14:25.765 --> 14:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
became a Muslim extremist.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was him on the streets of
New York.

14:29.869 --> 14:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: There will
be no peace
with Israel until Israel is in
pieces.

14:35.241 --> 14:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Morton also
helped found
Revolution Muslim, a Web site
that the FBI

14:39.712 --> 14:46.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says encouraged Muslims to
support Osama bin
Laden, al-Qaida and other
violent jihadi groups.

14:46.152 --> 14:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Web site threatened violence
against the
creators of the Comedy Central
show "South

14:49.856 --> 14:53.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Park" for a 2010 cartoon
depicting the Prophet
Mohammed.

14:53.726 --> 14:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, Morton was sentenced to
more than
11-and-a-half years in jail for
using the

14:58.731 --> 15:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Internet to threaten bodily
harm.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But here we are four years
later.

15:03.536 --> 15:07.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's a free man with a
decent-paying job at
a George Washington University
think tank

15:08.007 --> 15:09.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the nation's capital.

15:09.909 --> 15:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Morton is out of jail early
because he cooperated
with authorities in the U.S. and
overseas.

15:15.414 --> 15:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He worked undercover to gather
intelligence
on those who still trusted the
man they saw

15:20.119 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in those videos.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He helped train law enforcement
to recognize
people on the path he was on,
and helped analyze

15:26.192 --> 15:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the behavior of suspected
terrorists with
insights only someone like him
could have.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're on camera now.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Your face is going to be out
there.

15:35.535 --> 15:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're going to be walking
around a college
campus, as someone who has been
convicted

15:41.974 --> 15:44.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of supporting al-Qaida.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: Yes.

15:46.612 --> 15:52.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's 10,000
sets of parents
who might be a little concerned
that someone

15:52.451 --> 15:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a target on their back
might be walking
around on the same campus as
their students.

15:56.823 --> 16:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: Well, there
has been
an extensive security plan put
in place by

16:01.460 --> 16:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very competent security team
at G.W.

16:04.831 --> 16:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have assessed the risk
with the law
enforcement community, federal,
local, and

16:14.841 --> 16:17.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some state agencies.

16:17.243 --> 16:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is very, very, very
little risk
at this point.

16:22.148 --> 16:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Getting to
this point, Morton
says, has been a long road
through radicalization

16:26.586 --> 16:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then de-radicalization.

16:28.521 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: I came from
a very tumultuous
childhood, where there was very
severe abuse.

16:33.926 --> 16:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I reached out to my
society and tried
to get assistance to stop that
abuse, the

16:39.765 --> 16:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, my family, and the
society around
me didn't prevent it.

16:44.070 --> 16:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, at a very young age, I
rejected American
culture and the American way of
life, so to

16:52.912 --> 16:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say, and sought a new identity.

16:54.780 --> 16:58.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Not to
discount the abuse
that you went through, but lots
of kids live

16:58.551 --> 16:59.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through child abuse.

16:59.886 --> 17:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't go out and build Web
sites supporting
Osama bin Laden.

17:03.189 --> 17:07.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: Well, it's
a common denominator
with regard to radicalization
processes.

17:07.093 --> 17:12.231 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
When we study
pre-radicalization, we
oftentimes
see trauma, we see criminality,
we see that

17:12.265 --> 17:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the radical or the violent
extremist interpretation
of Islam attracts people with
some degree

17:17.503 --> 17:18.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of baggage.

17:18.504 --> 17:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't mean that I justify
it.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't mean that I blame
what I became
on what I went through.

17:23.142 --> 17:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A runaway at
16, he was
a hippie following the Grateful
Dead.

17:27.980 --> 17:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Drug dealing landed him in jail,
and there,
he says, began his slow
introduction to Islam.

17:33.052 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who convert to
Islam all
over the world every day, don't
end up where

17:37.690 --> 17:38.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you are.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How's that?

17:40.660 --> 17:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: I was a
radical and extremely
political before I adopted
Islam.

17:45.798 --> 17:51.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think I naturally
gravitated toward
the politicized interpretation
of Islam.

17:51.404 --> 17:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from there, I identified
with the sort
of anti-imperialist message that
was being

17:57.043 --> 17:58.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
promoted by al-Qaida.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: His thoughts
were becoming
progressively more radical.

18:02.114 --> 18:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2006, at a Muslim Day Parade
in New York,
he happened upon the extremist
Muslim Thinkers

18:07.820 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Society.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: I glanced
to my left
and saw the black flag, what we
call the black

18:11.624 --> 18:18.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flag of ISIS now, but has a much
longer history,
and saw the movement or the
group promoting

18:18.197 --> 18:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the images of dead children on
the streets
and selling T-shirts that said
"I love jihad"

18:22.335 --> 18:23.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Arabic.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I immediately walked up to them
and told them
I wanted to join them.

18:26.372 --> 18:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And very soon, I was climbing
their ranks
and becoming one of their
primary speakers

18:30.676 --> 18:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the streets of Manhattan,
Jackson Heights,
Queens, protests outside of
Israeli embassies,

18:36.048 --> 18:37.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
et cetera, et cetera.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Around this
time, Morton
enrolled at Columbia
University's School of

18:40.953 --> 18:45.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
International and Public
Affairs, earning
a master's degree in
international affairs.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: Sort of
sort of like
I was living dual lives.

18:48.494 --> 18:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was Jesse Morton in school,
and I was Younus
Abdullah Muhammad, leader of
Revolution Muslim,

18:56.068 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outside of school.

18:57.903 --> 19:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I never combined the two, so
people didn't
really know what I was doing
while I was at

19:02.708 --> 19:04.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Columbia.

19:04.543 --> 19:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the Ivy
League education
did nothing to moderate Morton's
world view.

19:08.114 --> 19:12.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2007, he and a few other
radicals started
the Revolution Muslim Web site.

19:12.752 --> 19:19.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: At the
time, online radicalization
was becoming easier because of
the Web 2.0,

19:19.158 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the relatively nascent platforms
like YouTube
and chat rooms.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Online forums, that was the
platform back
then.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you could see that the
number of hits
that were on the Web site were
growing and

19:30.936 --> 19:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mounting, so we knew that we
were having an
enhanced impact.

19:33.072 --> 19:38.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
now-defunct Web site
posted calls for jihad and
excerpts from "Inspire,"

19:38.344 --> 19:40.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the al-Qaida magazine.

19:40.613 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lorenzo Vidino is the director
of the Program
on Extremism at George
Washington's Center

19:44.450 --> 19:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Cyber and Homeland Security.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was his idea to hire Morton.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LORENZO VIDINO, George
Washington University:
His Web site was one of the
first -- I would

19:51.690 --> 19:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say the first Web site in the
United States
that spread the message of
al-Qaida, of other

19:58.964 --> 20:00.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
groups.

20:00.566 --> 20:05.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was sort of the go-to
place for wannabe
jihadists in the United States.

20:05.604 --> 20:12.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is no coincidence that a
variety of individuals
who have gone down the
trajectory of radicalization

20:12.511 --> 20:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and eventually become terrorists
were at some
point in one way or the other
involved in

20:16.715 --> 20:17.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Web site.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In 2009,
Morton moved to
Morocco.

20:20.486 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While running the Web site, he
taught English
and standardized test prep.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ironically, moving to Morocco
didn't harden
his views toward jihad.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quite the opposite.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meeting a new generation of
students, Morton
says, made him begin rethinking
things.

20:33.432 --> 20:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: And in my
conversations
with my students, I realized
that the vision,

20:37.303 --> 20:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the utopian vision of the
Islamic State that
I held, the general,
particularly from amongst

20:43.275 --> 20:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the millennial population,
didn't have any
desire for such a society.

20:49.482 --> 20:55.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In May of
2011, Morton was
arrested in Morocco on a U.S.
criminal complaint,

20:55.287 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charged with communicating
threats online.

20:57.957 --> 21:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After five months in a Moroccan
prison, he
was flown back to the U.S. to
face trial.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His de-radicalization began on
the plane ride
home.

21:05.865 --> 21:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: And the
agent that initiated
communication on that plane
asked me what

21:11.470 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to be called, Jesse
Morton or Younus
Abdullah Muhammad.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, interestingly enough, I
responded Jesse
Morton.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it shocked me too.

21:19.411 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over time, I learned that my
identity
as Younus Abdullah Muhammad was
an effort

21:23.449 --> 21:25.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to kill a person that I hated.

21:25.684 --> 21:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He eventually
received a
sentence of 11-and-a-half years.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In jail, he was interviewed by
counterterror
officials.

21:32.658 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those interactions, he says,
further changed
his world view.

21:35.861 --> 21:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: I had
interaction with
a very intelligent and a very
sincere female

21:42.601 --> 21:44.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FBI agent.

21:44.470 --> 21:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over the course of a very
long debriefing
process, the world view that I
once held that

21:48.040 --> 21:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
held them to be enemies of Islam
and engaged
in a conspiracy to prevent Islam
from establishing

21:53.846 --> 21:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
itself politically was, in fact,
false.

21:56.115 --> 22:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Soon, Morton
says he began
helping counterterrorism
officials in their

22:00.286 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigations.

22:02.121 --> 22:07.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: We
generated significant
rewards from my cooperation,
some of which

22:07.493 --> 22:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
involved international activity.

22:10.196 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, the Syrian civil
war was heating
up, and more jihadist groups
were appearing.

22:17.136 --> 22:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And several people from the West
were joining
them.

22:20.239 --> 22:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't talk about specifics of
particular
cases, but we also yielded
domestic investigatory

22:26.712 --> 22:28.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gains.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lorenzo Vidino
thinks Morton
will make a valuable
contribution to research

22:31.150 --> 22:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on terrorism and radicalization.

22:33.118 --> 22:37.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: Most of the
analysis of radicalization
comes from outsiders, from
people who are

22:37.623 --> 22:39.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just studying it.

22:39.558 --> 22:44.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This analysis will come from the
inside, firsthand
from somebody who has lived it
and has played

22:44.897 --> 22:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a prominent role in that scene.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's also
going to be
several people watching this
that say, how

22:50.970 --> 22:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do we know he's telling the
truth?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How can we trust him?

22:55.441 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: The
prosecuting attorney
on my case advocated for my
hiring at G.W.

22:59.411 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And some of the biggest
high-profile individuals
of the counterterrorism
community have also

23:06.185 --> 23:07.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vouched for me.

23:07.820 --> 23:14.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I will prove that to the
public as
time goes on.

23:14.360 --> 23:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What if
somebody doesn't
want to believe that and puts
your life at

23:21.967 --> 23:23.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
risk?

23:23.969 --> 23:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE CURTIS MORTON: If I am
willing to sacrifice
in the past so much to promote
such a disgusting

23:29.675 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideology, then I think that, if
I'm sincere
in my reform, I should be as
equally dedicated

23:38.617 --> 23:42.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and equally passionate about
trying to repair
some of the damage that I have
done.

23:42.721 --> 23:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the PBS
"NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan in
Washington.

23:52.765 --> 23:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the PBS
"NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan in
Washington.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Politics Monday
looks ahead to Donald Trump's
immigration

24:02.908 --> 24:08.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech and some final primary
elections; plus,
a story of friendship and
hardship while growing

24:08.681 --> 24:10.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up in Brooklyn.

24:10.182 --> 24:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first: More than 80 people
have been
killed in Chicago this month.

24:14.086 --> 24:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And more than 400 have been shot
in August.

24:17.389 --> 24:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of a weekly and even
daily pattern
of violence plaguing big and
often impoverished

24:22.127 --> 24:23.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sections of the city.

24:23.395 --> 24:27.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, it's a crisis that has
eluded major
solutions.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

24:28.967 --> 24:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: One of Chicago's
bloodiest weekends
this year ended the city's
deadliest month

24:34.106 --> 24:36.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 20 years.

24:36.108 --> 24:41.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Among the victims, Nykea
Aldridge, a cousin
of basketball star Dwyane Wade,
now with the

Chicago Bulls.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police Superintendent Eddie
Johnson:

24:45.517 --> 24:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE JOHNSON, Chicago Police
Superintendent:
She wasn't aware that her short
life would

24:48.287 --> 24:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand as an example for what is
a clear failure
in the criminal justice system
here in Chicago.

24:53.926 --> 24:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Aldridge was caught
in crossfire
as she pushed one of her four
young children

24:58.797 --> 25:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a stroller near a school on
the city's
South Side.

25:02.868 --> 25:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The surge in gun killings has
largely been
concentrated there and on the
West Side.

25:07.673 --> 25:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two brothers, Darwin and Derren
Sorrells,
are now charged with
first-degree murder in

25:12.578 --> 25:14.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Aldridge's killing.

25:14.346 --> 25:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both are convicted felons on
parole, and police
said Derren Sorrells is a gang
member.

25:19.385 --> 25:23.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EDDIE JOHNSON: This
reprehensible act of violence
is an example of why we need to
change the

25:23.822 --> 25:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way we treat habitual offenders
in the city
of Chicago.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
When will enough be enough?

25:30.229 --> 25:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Gun violence has
fueled a jump
in Chicago homicides this year
to more than

25:35.834 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
449, nearly as many as all of
last year.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 2,300 shootings have
been reported
since January.

25:44.676 --> 25:51.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And police have seized nearly
6,000 illegal
guns, roughly one every hour.

25:51.383 --> 25:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far this year, Chicago has
seen more homicides
than New York and Los Angeles
combined, even

25:58.757 --> 26:01.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
though both are larger.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend may have been
especially bad,
but in many ways, it is no
different than

26:05.264 --> 26:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many other summer weekends in
Chicago.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are joined from Chicago by
Jedidiah Brown.

26:11.203 --> 26:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a community organizer who's
seen this
violence firsthand, president of
Chicago Life,

26:16.642 --> 26:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a community advocacy group.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And by Lori Lightfoot.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's the president of the
Chicago Police
Board and the head of the Police
Accountability

26:24.716 --> 26:26.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Task Force.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They join us, both, from
Chicago.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks for being with us.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ms. Lightfoot, I would like to
start with
you.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has been a problem for so
many years
in Chicago.

26:34.993 --> 26:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen evolving tactics
and strategies
by the police, by community
activists.

26:42.401 --> 26:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there anything you can point
to, from your
point of view, that's a sign of
hope, that's

26:47.039 --> 26:48.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a sign of progress?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT, President,
Chicago Police
Board: Well, I think one of the
most important

26:50.876 --> 26:57.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
things is, this issue of
violence is now not
something that's isolated to
particular neighborhoods

26:57.816 --> 27:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Chicago, but it's really a
conversation
that has captured the
imagination of people

27:02.454 --> 27:04.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across the city.

27:04.423 --> 27:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think shining a light on
it and transparency
around that is something that's
very important.

27:08.560 --> 27:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason for that is that
we have a
lot of great, smart, committed
people here

27:13.365 --> 27:15.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Chicago.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think bringing people
together to take
a fresh look at some of these
issues is going

27:19.471 --> 27:25.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be vitally important to
really making an
appreciable difference in what's
happening

27:25.644 --> 27:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Chicago, and also not just
thinking about
this from a law enforcement
perspective, that

27:31.116 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issues that I think are the
root causes
of the violence that we see in
many of these

27:37.556 --> 27:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhoods are not something
that's going
to be solved purely with a law
enforcement

27:41.627 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
answer.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got to use what I would
call soft
power.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There has got to be investment
in neighborhoods.

27:47.566 --> 27:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to make sure that
we're giving
our young people alternatives to
this life

27:52.838 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the streets.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have got to keep talking
about the
importance of the sanctity of
life.

27:58.043 --> 28:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also absolutely have to
focus on the
proliferation of illegal guns
that really

28:04.116 --> 28:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is changing and making more
difficult the
issue of solving these violence
issues.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I want to get back to
that gun
issue, but, Pastor Brown, you're
on the streets.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You talk to these young people.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You see what's going on.

28:17.062 --> 28:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think about what Ms.
Lightfoot
has just said about this -- sort
of the use

28:21.366 --> 28:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of soft power; it's not just a
police issue?

28:23.835 --> 28:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEDIDIAH BROWN, President,
Chicago Life: I
think those are great talking
points, but

28:27.973 --> 28:30.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm very -- I saw a young man
shot this morning.

28:30.976 --> 28:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, the conversation is being
had across
the city, but the conversation
is people waking

28:37.282 --> 28:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to the fact that this mayoral
administration
has failed our city, that there
is a lot of

28:43.355 --> 28:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dysfunction in our neighborhoods
because there
is no representation, there is
no resources,

28:48.961 --> 28:50.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there is no activities.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there is just a lot of talk.

28:52.598 --> 28:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I hear what she's saying,
but the reality
of it is that it hasn't gotten
any better.

28:57.369 --> 29:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm really praying that the
man I saw
shot this morning on my block
where I live

29:01.173 --> 29:03.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to live.

29:03.075 --> 29:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You talk in your
Twitter feed about
sitting -- Pastor Brown, sitting
in your living

29:07.279 --> 29:12.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
room hearing shots and sirens at
night, but
you say you still love the city.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEDIDIAH BROWN: Yes, I love
Chicago.

29:14.853 --> 29:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to give up on it,
even seeing
the young man shot this morning.

29:18.457 --> 29:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like I said, the conversation,
as a resident,
we recognize that City Hall and
the police

29:23.662 --> 29:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
department, that they could do
more to empower
the residents, but they simply
just won't

29:29.067 --> 29:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do it, because I don't think
that they frankly
care.

29:32.104 --> 29:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I, as a resident, I am not
giving to give
up to violence and to the
misconceptions of

29:37.876 --> 29:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's going on, because this is
not all gang
violence that is happening in
our city.

29:41.113 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ms. Lightfoot, he
talks about the
feeling that the city leaders
don't care about

29:46.551 --> 29:47.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the South Side.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: I just think
that's wrong.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, there is more that can be
done.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no question about that.

29:53.291 --> 29:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we need to be working
towards is
a place where people who are
directly affected

29:57.729 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the violence, people of other
-- of good
will across the city, elected
officials and

30:02.134 --> 30:06.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the police department are coming
together
in a space where we can work
together towards

30:06.204 --> 30:08.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a solution.

30:08.106 --> 30:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people who are literally
captives in their
neighborhoods by this violence,
the rhetoric,

30:13.311 --> 30:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with pointing fingers back and
forth, that
doesn't help solve the problem
that they are

30:17.516 --> 30:19.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
living through every single day.

30:19.785 --> 30:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while I respect the pastor's
opinion,
I think that what we need to be
thinking about

30:24.523 --> 30:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, how we can move forward
together as a
community to solve this issue as
a community?

30:30.328 --> 30:32.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It can't be top-down.

30:32.130 --> 30:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can't be only the police
department doing
it, without respectful
engagement with the

30:36.368 --> 30:38.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has got to be something
that all of
us roll our sleeves up on and
work towards

30:41.106 --> 30:42.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
solutions.

30:42.941 --> 30:47.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the language that we
use in talking
about these issues is also just
as important

30:47.079 --> 30:49.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the specific actions that we
take.

30:49.981 --> 30:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we need to move
towards positive
solutions that are at multiple
tiers, with

30:55.921 --> 31:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the relevant stakeholders
rolling up their
sleeves and working hard to try
to address

31:00.425 --> 31:01.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this issue.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I said, it's not an issue
that the police
department can solve by itself.

31:05.731 --> 31:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It absolutely has a role to
play, but so do
our federal law enforcement
partners, as well

31:10.502 --> 31:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the faith community, the
people that are
out there in those
neighborhoods.

31:13.638 --> 31:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have got to create a
space where those
conversations can be had.

31:17.442 --> 31:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pastor Brown, you
have said that
you think Ms. Lightfoot has nice
talking points,

31:23.782 --> 31:24.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but what would you do?

31:24.983 --> 31:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would you want to see done
to achieve
your goals?

31:29.654 --> 31:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEDIDIAH BROWN: So, what I'm
doing now is,
I'm actually organizing my
neighborhood to

31:34.426 --> 31:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take its safety in its own
hands, trying to
get residents back to the days
of community

31:38.797 --> 31:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
watch and community patrols.

31:40.632 --> 31:45.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do want to point out that,
yes, it's going
to take everybody, all hands on
deck.

31:45.237 --> 31:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, like, even with Lori,
who I met when
she was appointed by the mayor,
and we -- they

31:51.843 --> 31:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a commitment to us to
working with us
after the Laquan McDonald
surfaced, and we

31:57.115 --> 32:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have not heard anything from
them once they
realized we wasn't just going to
provide them

32:01.153 --> 32:03.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cover.

32:03.054 --> 32:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have been since then
working very hard
to organize the neighborhood and
to let people

32:06.458 --> 32:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that they have to take
public safety
into their own hands and the
cavalry isn't

32:11.129 --> 32:12.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coming.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have heard nothing from
City Hall,
nothing to help us.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they know who are the ones
out here that
are doing the real work.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they know that we're out
here consistently
when victims are shot.

32:19.805 --> 32:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're now trying to find
something to
replace the trauma.

32:24.009 --> 32:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When someone is shot in the
neighborhood,
it creates a very intense
feeling of sorrow

32:29.181 --> 32:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and grief and wanting to give
up.

32:31.216 --> 32:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're just -- we're
getting ready
to do pop-ups in the
neighborhood to infuse

32:34.820 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hope in places that have been
robbed by gun
violence.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're having to do it on our
own.

32:39.157 --> 32:42.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pastor Jedidiah
Brown, Loretta
Lynch, unfortunately, this is
not going to

32:42.194 --> 32:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the last time we're going to
talk about
this.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, unfortunately, we're out of
time for
now.

32:46.264 --> 32:47.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

32:47.766 --> 32:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Thank you.

32:51.903 --> 32:56.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEDIDIAH BROWN: No problem.

32:56.074 --> 33:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As the summer winds
down, the
presidential campaign is only
gathering steam,

33:02.514 --> 33:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as candidates and voters sort a
through the
pluses and the minuses of
immigration reform,

33:07.786 --> 33:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions about the Clinton
Foundation, appeals
to African-American voters, and
a dramatically

33:12.123 --> 33:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
altered general election map.

33:14.759 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's Politics Monday, so we turn
to Amy Walter
of The Cook Political Report and
Stuart Rothenberg

33:20.699 --> 33:22.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of The Washington Post.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you back.

33:23.368 --> 33:24.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Happy Monday.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Thank
you.

33:25.637 --> 33:26.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG, The
Washington Post: Thank
you.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's start 3,000
feet up and
talk about the map.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the things that's
different in this
election, among all the things
that are different

33:30.909 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this election, is that the
map feels different
than it has in the past.

33:34.246 --> 33:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The states that Republicans
think are slam
dunks aren't necessarily slam
dunks.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Same for the Democrats?

33:40.285 --> 33:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, the bad news
for Republicans
is that the states that look
less likely to

33:45.857 --> 33:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be in their traditional lane are
the states
that Republicans traditionally
hold on to,

33:50.228 --> 33:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or at least in the most recent
elections have.

33:52.530 --> 33:57.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the states, just
look at the
polling right now, there isn't
one state that

33:57.335 --> 34:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is trailing in
that Barack
Obama didn't win or that Mitt
Romney won.

34:03.475 --> 34:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she's winning in all the
states that Barack
Obama carried.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's also doing better than
Obama in
some of those states that he
didn't carry,

34:13.585 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specifically in 2012, like North
Carolina.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now we're talking about
Arizona, we're
talking about Missouri, we're
talking about

34:18.924 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Georgia.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even South Carolina has become
more competitive.

34:21.927 --> 34:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are states that I think
are still a
reach for Hillary Clinton, but
the fact that

34:25.597 --> 34:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're even on the map makes it
different.

34:27.832 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is the big irony,
right?

34:29.234 --> 34:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was that Donald Trump was
going to come
in and shake up the map.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the one that was going to
make all
these changes.

34:34.172 --> 34:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is not one state that
Barack Obama carried
that he's doing well.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The map has been
shaken, but not
to his advantage.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes, I don't
think the
map has changed that
dramatically.

34:44.015 --> 34:44.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Really?

34:45.016 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I still use the 2012
Obama-Romney race as
the baseline.

34:50.088 --> 34:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Amy is exactly right
that there
are a couple of Republican
states that now

34:55.293 --> 34:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look to be flirting with Hillary
Clinton.

34:58.596 --> 35:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a couple of Democratic
states that
Donald Trump is making a run at,
particularly

35:04.736 --> 35:06.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nevada and Iowa.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, otherwise, the rest of the
map looks
consistent.

35:08.707 --> 35:12.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, there are two swing
states that
look to be off the table, at
least for the

35:12.811 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

35:14.646 --> 35:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would be Colorado and
Virginia, where
former Secretary Clinton is
doing quite well.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, so let's talk
about what the
candidates have been talking
about and how

35:22.053 --> 35:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that fits into this discussion
about the map,
which is, let's talk about
Donald Trump.

35:26.124 --> 35:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is going to give a speech on
Wednesday,
he has said -- he said this
before -- on immigration.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the last two weeks, it
seems as if
he has shifted.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Has he shifted on immigration?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Softened, I think is the word he
used.

35:37.802 --> 35:41.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I guess that's the
question that
we're all wondering, is, what is
happening?

35:41.906 --> 35:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We don't know.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I'm of many minds on
this issue.

35:45.744 --> 35:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first says, there is nothing
new or different
about a candidate after a
primary softening

35:52.384 --> 35:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and moving to the center.

35:53.418 --> 35:54.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

35:54.419 --> 35:55.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nothing new about that.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, usually, a candidate does
that in like
May or June or maybe at their
convention,

35:59.124 --> 36:00.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which he obviously didn't do.

36:00.959 --> 36:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing is, if you're
going to move
on a centerpiece of your
campaign, you should

36:05.497 --> 36:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably have an actual message
on that, know
what that policy is.

36:10.201 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither he nor his campaign
seems to understand
what that is.

36:13.038 --> 36:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The final thing is, making a
change on the
policy, I don't think, is the
real issue.

36:16.741 --> 36:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the temperament that's the
issue.

36:19.377 --> 36:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The wall is a bigger issue
because of the
temperament.

36:20.545 --> 36:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How many minds are
you of?

36:21.980 --> 36:24.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Amy said that
she is of
many minds on this issue.

36:24.182 --> 36:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Donald Trump is of many
minds on what
his position is on this issue.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:29.888 --> 36:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: There has
been buzz in
the last 24 hours that Trump is
going to come

36:31.923 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on Wednesday and talk about
securing the
border first, and then
addressing people who

36:37.262 --> 36:38.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are here without papers.

36:39.030 --> 36:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he has softened -- he
has tried to
soften his message a little bit
by talking

36:43.535 --> 36:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more about a humane treatment.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He has used that
word more than
once, yes.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes.

36:49.941 --> 36:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And six months ago, a year ago,
it was -- he
never seemed to be concerned
with how people

36:54.212 --> 36:55.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are being treated.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just get them the hell out.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think that's a difference.

36:58.249 --> 37:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
Hillary Clinton's
sore spot, the thing that never
seems to go

37:00.385 --> 37:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away, which are questions about
her truthfulness,
her honesty, her e-mails.

37:05.123 --> 37:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in this poll from Monmouth
University
that came out today, voters were
asked, do

37:09.561 --> 37:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you think Hillary Clinton gave
special treatment
to big donors of the Clinton
Foundation when

37:13.731 --> 37:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was secretary of state, or
did she do
nothing out of the ordinary in
the way she

37:17.035 --> 37:18.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treated them?

37:18.269 --> 37:21.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a whole lot of people say
she gave special
treatment.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in that same poll, she's
leading pretty
well nationally.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So?

37:25.176 --> 37:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's the theme of
this campaign,
right?

37:27.312 --> 37:29.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Stu and I have
talked to and listened
to many voters saying, this is
the lesser

37:31.749 --> 37:33.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of two evils campaign.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are not excited about
their choice.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're just picking the
candidate that they
think is the least bad.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And perceptions of Hillary
Clinton are pretty
well settled.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't think she's
trustworthy.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not happy about this,
but when they
look at their other choice right
now, they

37:46.698 --> 37:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feel even less secure.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: These choices don't
happen in
a vacuum.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, they're not going to
feel that
she's trustworthy between now
and then.

37:54.405 --> 37:55.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

37:55.406 --> 37:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And that's a
problem.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as you point out, in the
Monmouth poll,
she was ahead by seven points.

37:59.477 --> 38:04.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a case of, I have to
choose which
candidate I hate least, at least
with the

38:04.682 --> 38:06.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does that mean that
she's safe
in just assuming that she
doesn't need to

38:09.454 --> 38:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worry about questions like that?

38:11.289 --> 38:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, any
candidate ought
to worry all the time, and
campaign managers

38:14.826 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

38:16.694 --> 38:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think that most of the
negatives for
both candidates, frankly, are
already baked

38:20.064 --> 38:21.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the cake.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having said that, if you're
Hillary Clinton's
campaign, you don't want the
topic of the

38:24.836 --> 38:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day to be her problems either
with the foundation
or with e-mails.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to be discussing
different kinds
of things.

38:31.643 --> 38:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, unless something
really new comes
out and changes the narrative,
that we probably

38:39.284 --> 38:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the race that we have now
for a while.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I completely agree.

38:42.754 --> 38:46.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I was on vacation
last week watching
with great interest, arm's
length, as Donald

38:46.658 --> 38:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump came out repeatedly and
made a real
pitch to African-American
voters.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You talk about, these are the
things that
usually happen in the spring.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton pushed back
as well.

38:54.933 --> 38:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got the distinct impression
they weren't
talking to African American...

38:58.303 --> 38:59.571 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:59.604 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stu is laughing at
me -- African-American
voters.

39:01.806 --> 39:03.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, what was your impression?

39:03.041 --> 39:04.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

39:04.943 --> 39:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My impression was, the challenge
right now
for the Trump campaign -- sorry
-- is to consolidate

39:10.181 --> 39:11.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican voters.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, part of the reason he's
behind seven,
eight points in some of these
polls is not

39:16.020 --> 39:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because he's losing -- yes, he's
losing independents,
but because he's losing
Republicans.

39:21.526 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Talking to these suburban swing
voters who
have distanced themselves from
Trump, trying

39:26.965 --> 39:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring them back by saying,
he's really
not as bigoted as he may come
across.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Really, he's softer, he's more
humane.

39:33.271 --> 39:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in fact, it's
Hillary Clinton
who is bigoted.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's Hillary Clinton
who has the
problem.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Boy, that is
a really tough
message to deliver.

39:39.644 --> 39:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, with her
record, her support
in the minority community,
particularly the

39:45.450 --> 39:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-American community, the
way they view
her, calling her a bigot, I
don't think they're

39:49.320 --> 39:51.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to accept that.

39:51.422 --> 39:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, the Republicans do
have an opportunity
here to make the case to
Latinos, to African-Americans,

39:56.160 --> 40:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to all minorities about the
Republican agenda
and free market and all that.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: But Donald
Trump is not
the guy to make that argument.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All right, Stu, we
will see.

much.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

voters this election?

40:36.801 --> 40:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
novelist and poet who writes for
young people
and adults, and a new work of
fiction that

40:41.306 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks back at a world she knew
well.

40:43.708 --> 40:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown makes a new
addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf from
Brooklyn, New York.

40:47.011 --> 40:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON, Author,
"Another Brooklyn":
The basketball courts have
moved.

40:49.580 --> 40:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They used to be along here.

40:50.815 --> 40:52.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they came along and
renovated the park.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you come back
up here when
you were writing?

40:54.519 --> 40:55.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: I did.

40:55.586 --> 40:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wanted to talk about walking
through it.

40:57.855 --> 41:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I really wanted to get this park
on the page.

41:00.391 --> 41:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The park is in
the Brooklyn
neighborhood of Bushwick, where
author Jacqueline

41:05.029 --> 41:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Woodson came of age in the
1970s.

41:07.965 --> 41:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her new novel, set in that time
and place,
is about four teenage friends,
as Woodson

41:13.171 --> 41:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writes, growing up girl in the
city, with
big aspirations, but also
suffering terrible

41:18.943 --> 41:21.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
losses along the way.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called "Another Brooklyn."

41:22.947 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: I knew that
it was going
to be an story about friendship
and the way

41:25.550 --> 41:29.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people come together and
eventually come apart.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I just went in.

41:31.856 --> 41:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, having grown up
girl in Brooklyn
myself, it was -- it was -- I
had some information

41:38.863 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that I needed to tell this
story.

41:40.598 --> 41:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you wanted to
tell this
because?

41:43.167 --> 41:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: I don't
think it's a story
that's really been told in that
way that we

41:50.074 --> 41:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk intimately about the
complexity of what
it means to grow up, not only
girl, but to

41:56.714 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grow up a girl of color, and
grow up specifically
an African-American girl, or a
Caribbean-American

42:03.054 --> 42:05.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
girl, in the city.

42:05.123 --> 42:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had the main character of
Bushwick, which
is a character I knew well
because I grew

42:10.461 --> 42:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up there, but I wanted...

42:12.029 --> 42:13.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean the
place as a character?

42:13.831 --> 42:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Yes, the
place.

42:14.932 --> 42:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you felt that
from the
beginning?

42:16.701 --> 42:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Yes, yes, I
knew that
Bushwick was going to be the
main character,

42:18.236 --> 42:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that everything was going to
revolve in this
neighborhood.

42:22.407 --> 42:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Bushwick of
the 1970s that
Woodson describes had more than
its share

42:27.044 --> 42:31.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of problems and dangers,
especially for young
girls.

42:31.182 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Drugs were everywhere.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White flight was well under way.

42:34.552 --> 42:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she also recalls a vibrant
place, with
young people, like her
characters, who aspired

42:39.757 --> 42:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to and achieved great things.

42:41.592 --> 42:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: It was very
much alive,
and I wanted to capture that,
especially given

42:46.397 --> 42:50.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how people think of Bushwick as
this place
that's newly discovered.

42:50.368 --> 42:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time I hear that, I'm
just like,
no, there were people here
before then.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you fear that
that history
has been lost?

42:58.676 --> 43:00.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that part of what is going on
here?

43:00.478 --> 43:02.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Yes, I think
it can get
lost.

43:02.447 --> 43:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think writers are the
history keepers,
right?

43:05.583 --> 43:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're the ones who are bearing
witness to
what's going on in the world.

43:10.521 --> 43:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I feel like it's our job to
put that down
on paper, and put it out into
the world, so

43:15.426 --> 43:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that it can be remembered.

43:17.295 --> 43:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Woodson told her
own story
of growing up in South Carolina
and then Brooklyn

43:21.232 --> 43:27.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in her 2014 free verse memoir
"Brown Girl
Dreaming," where she describes
how she dreamed

43:27.038 --> 43:29.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of being a writer at the age of
7.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why a writer?

43:33.211 --> 43:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: When I was a
kid, I got
in trouble for lying a lot, and
I had a teacher

43:36.814 --> 43:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, instead of lying, write it
down, because
if you write it down, it's not a
lie anymore;

43:40.451 --> 43:41.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's fiction.

43:41.419 --> 43:42.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I was, like, wait.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ah, that's your
definition
of fiction.

43:43.788 --> 43:44.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:44.789 --> 43:45.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: Yes.

43:45.790 --> 43:46.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's legitimized.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was like, wait, there's a way
out of this.

43:48.192 --> 43:51.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, also, I just loved the
physical act of
writing.

43:51.562 --> 43:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I learned to write my
name for the
first time, there was such a
power to realizing

43:55.933 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you put letters together,
and they make
words, and you put words
together, and they

43:59.370 --> 44:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make sentences, and sentences
make paragraphs.

44:01.672 --> 44:08.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was magic to me, that
all you needed
was this pencil and a notebook,
and you were

44:08.246 --> 44:09.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on your way.

44:09.547 --> 44:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: On her way to a
life of writing
and many honors.

44:13.017 --> 44:16.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Woodson is author of more than
30 books for
children and young adults.

44:16.454 --> 44:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her memoir won the National Book
Award for
Young People's Literature.

44:20.391 --> 44:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new novel is her first for
adults in 20
years.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Woodson still lives in Brooklyn
in a different
neighborhood.

44:27.698 --> 44:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we returned with her to
Bushwick,
she kept running into old
friends, this one

44:31.869 --> 44:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in front of her childhood family
home.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like much of the neighborhood,
it's been renovated.

44:37.308 --> 44:42.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brooklyn itself is another
Brooklyn now, gentrified,
with whites moving back in.

44:42.680 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Woodson says she always wants to
tell the
bigger story, beyond her
characters.

44:46.918 --> 44:50.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE WOODSON: It's always
been me in
the context of the bigger world,
in the context

44:50.388 --> 44:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the greater good, in the
context of what
is this story trying to say, and
why is it

44:54.892 --> 45:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to say it, and what does
it mean to
someone outside of this
experience?

45:02.300 --> 45:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even as I'm creating the
characters, and
putting them on the page, and
having them

45:07.505 --> 45:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
move around, I'm thinking, what
does it mean?

45:09.840 --> 45:14.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I put four black girls on
the page, what
is it going to mean when it goes
out into

45:14.078 --> 45:15.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world?

45:15.079 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How are they going to be
represented?

45:16.080 --> 45:18.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How are they going to be
digested?

45:19.016 --> 45:22.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So -- and what is my
responsibility in all
of that?

45:22.753 --> 45:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jacqueline
Woodson now has
another responsibility.

45:26.090 --> 45:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, the Poetry Foundation
named her
