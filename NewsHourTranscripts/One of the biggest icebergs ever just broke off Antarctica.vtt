JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
Researchers have been watching
for months, waiting for a huge

00:04.700 --> 00:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
iceberg to break away from
an ice shelf in Antarctica.

00:08.666 --> 00:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That break was confirmed today.

00:10.933 --> 00:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to give you a sense
of the size, the volume of the
iceberg is said to be twice

00:15.433 --> 00:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as large as Lake Erie.

00:17.966 --> 00:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has been watching
all this and digging into the
larger questions about the

00:22.133 --> 00:23.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ice shelf.

00:23.366 --> 00:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's an update to
an earlier report.

00:25.366 --> 00:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly segment
on the Leading Edge of science.

00:29.533 --> 00:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This fast-growing
rift in the Antarctica ice
just created one of the largest

00:36.433 --> 00:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icebergs ever recorded,
about the size of Delaware,
weighing more than one trillion

00:42.400 --> 00:44.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tons.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The event had been
anticipated for months.

00:47.166 --> 00:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, some time between
Monday and today, the Larsen
Sea Ice Shelf became 12 percent

00:54.200 --> 00:55.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
smaller.

00:55.733 --> 00:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have known about this
for quite a while, right?

00:57.833 --> 01:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT, University
of Maryland: We have
certainly known about
the bulk of this rift

01:00.400 --> 01:02.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a while.

01:02.466 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kelly Brunt is a
glaciologist at the University
of Maryland and NASA's Goddard

01:05.966 --> 01:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Space Flight Center.

01:08.100 --> 01:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She used a wall of monitors
there to show me the growing
rift, fueled in part by rising

01:13.966 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
air and sea temperatures.

01:16.033 --> 01:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the glaciers in West
Antarctica all dropped
into the water, global
sea level would rise

01:21.700 --> 01:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by more than 15 feet.

01:23.866 --> 01:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brunt showed me the big
picture, a composite of images
from several satellites.

01:29.933 --> 01:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is how the
glacier ice flows here.

01:32.066 --> 01:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Ice flows from
the center of the continent
out to the edges, much like

01:38.600 --> 01:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
syrup on the center of
your pancake flowing
towards the edges.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see there are
areas where it's moving pretty
slowly, and then there are areas

01:44.133 --> 01:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's moving very quickly.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those quick places
are generally in our
areas of ice shelves.

01:50.633 --> 01:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, when we
think about ice, we think
about something static.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not static, is it?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLY BRUNT: Not at all.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Actually, it's highly dynamic.

01:57.900 --> 02:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can see from this
image it looks to me a
lot like a river system.

02:02.233 --> 02:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice shelves
are connected to the glaciers
that sit on land, but they are

02:08.666 --> 02:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also floating, like ice
cubes in a glass of water.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you had a drink
with ice cubes in it, as those
ice cube melts, they don't

02:15.866 --> 02:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
add to the height of
the water in the glass.

02:20.300 --> 02:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when ice shelves break down
and collapse, they do not have
a direct impact on mean sea

02:26.466 --> 02:27.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
level rise.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
However, they have
an indirect effect.

02:29.733 --> 02:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These ice shelves buttress
the flow of the ice upstream,
the ice that's flowing into

02:34.933 --> 02:36.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

02:36.966 --> 02:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you lose that
buttressing force,
you allow the upstream
glaciers to flow faster.

02:40.133 --> 02:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's similar to putting
more ice cubes into the
glass and letting those melt.

02:44.366 --> 02:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ice falls off the
edge of glaciers all the time.

02:48.166 --> 02:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is part of a natural
process called calving.

02:52.166 --> 02:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kelly Brunt says it is important
to judge the size of the
piece that breaks off relative

02:58.533 --> 03:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the size of the
glacier that is behind it.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says your fingernails
offer a handy model.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: If you break
your fingernail inside the
white part of your fingernail,

03:07.966 --> 03:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you probably don't
think much of it.

03:10.166 --> 03:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you break it below the
white part, you put a Band-Aid
on it, you think about it and

03:14.766 --> 03:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you keep an eye on it.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you lose your whole
fingernail, I don't
know what happens.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's pretty catastrophic.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This represents losing
the whole fingernail.

03:22.766 --> 03:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Like so many
features in Antarctica,
the Larsen Ice Shelf
is named for a famous

03:28.233 --> 03:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
19th century explorer.

03:31.100 --> 03:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it is disappearing,
section by section,
identified by letters.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Larsen A disintegrated in 1995.

03:39.466 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in 2002, a series
of satellite images
captured the end of Larsen
B in dramatic fashion

03:46.966 --> 03:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the course of six weeks.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The piece that broke off was
the size of Rhode Island.

03:52.733 --> 03:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: Losing this much
ice, losing ice that represents
roughly the state of Rhode

03:57.533 --> 04:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Island in a month-and-a-half,
just far exceeded
anybody's expectations
of what could happen

04:02.000 --> 04:04.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the time scale
that it could happen.

04:04.033 --> 04:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, it was kind
of like, we have to rethink
things here a little bit.

04:07.133 --> 04:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a wakeup call.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This was
absolutely a wakeup call.

04:10.933 --> 04:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists track
the ice using a half-dozen
U.S. and European satellites,

04:17.100 --> 04:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including Landsat, which
gathered these images.

04:20.466 --> 04:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But some of their best data came
from a satellite called ICESat.

04:24.366 --> 04:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Launched in 2003, it
ceased operation in 2009.

04:29.233 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It precisely measured the
glaciers using laser beams.

04:33.233 --> 04:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: This is quite
a few years of ICESat data
merged together to get a sense

04:39.633 --> 04:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in meters per year how
our ice sheet is changing.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see, the big picture
here is that our ice sheets
are changing where they are

04:46.433 --> 04:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in contact with both our warming
atmosphere and a warming ocean.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's basically along
the fringe of the continent.

04:52.866 --> 04:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: When ICESat
failed, NASA started
tracking the ice using
radar and lasers on

04:58.900 --> 05:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
board low-flying aircraft.

05:01.933 --> 05:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The IceBridge program is NASA's
largest air campaign ever,
but it still could not match

05:07.666 --> 05:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the eye above the sky.

05:10.733 --> 05:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It goes without saying that you
would view these satellites,
the capability to look at

05:14.066 --> 05:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this, as essential?

05:16.100 --> 05:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY BRUNT: What we're talking
about is a calving of an iceberg
that's a size of a state.

05:19.800 --> 05:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get that, you really need
a satellite to be able to
see all of it in one shot.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a function of scale and
repeatability to go back and
look at that area again with

05:31.700 --> 05:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the satellite that makes these
the perfect tools for looking
at the large-scale change

05:34.466 --> 05:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we're seeing
in this region.

05:36.933 --> 05:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And that's
precisely what Kelly
Brunt and her colleagues
will be doing now,

05:42.766 --> 05:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using satellite data, data
from the scant weather stations
that are on the surface there,

05:47.266 --> 05:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and additionally with buoys
which are in the water itself.

05:50.266 --> 05:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be poring over this
data over the course of actually
years to try to make some

05:57.300 --> 06:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of definitive statement
-- and I put definitive in
quotes because it's science,

06:00.200 --> 06:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after all -- as to whether
this particular calving event
is linked to climate change

06:04.900 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - Judy.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is
there a definitive answer
to that at this point?

06:09.333 --> 06:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It sounds like you're saying no.

06:10.566 --> 06:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Not just yet.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's what we know.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Larsen B, the previous big
calving event, scientists say
there is a very strong pile

06:18.366 --> 06:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of evidence indicating it
is linked to climate change.

06:21.433 --> 06:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Larsen A, they have
practically no data at all.

06:24.566 --> 06:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's one of these things
that, as Kelly Brunt put it,
this is where it gets exciting

06:30.700 --> 06:32.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for scientists.

06:32.666 --> 06:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will try to determine
if it's climate change that
actually caused this to happen,

06:35.633 --> 06:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also they will be
looking at the stability
of the ice shelf behind it.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does the flow increase?

06:41.700 --> 06:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What about the glacier
behind the ice shelf itself?

06:45.500 --> 06:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Looking at all that will give
them a lot of clues about what
this is going to mean ultimately

06:49.000 --> 06:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sea level rise.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
that, do they know the effect
this is going to have on sea

06:56.400 --> 06:58.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
levels in the area
and around the world?

06:58.733 --> 07:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes,
that's the big question.

07:00.733 --> 07:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Larsen C, even though
it's called a shelf,
it's kind of misleading.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was already in the water.

07:06.533 --> 07:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so like an ice cube in a
glass of water, it had already
done its bit of displacement

07:10.766 --> 07:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and already had made its
impact on sea level rise.

07:13.666 --> 07:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it had fallen off, scientists
estimate it would have
increased sea level across the

07:18.133 --> 07:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world by three millimeters.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That the gives you the
idea of the size of this.

07:22.266 --> 07:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, now the situation here is
to see whether the increased
rate, if there's an increased

07:29.100 --> 07:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate in the flow of that ice
shelf into the water, what
impact that might have on sea

07:33.866 --> 07:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
level rise in coming years.

07:35.866 --> 07:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, Judy, this is
long-term science, and we will
just have to watch it for years

07:39.333 --> 07:41.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
Miles, what happens
to this gigantic piece
of ice now that it's

07:44.100 --> 07:46.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
broken off?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, it
will probably not stay
intact the size of Delaware.

07:48.966 --> 07:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will break up over time.

07:51.066 --> 07:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fortunately, where it is,
it's not going to be in the
way of any shipping channels.

07:55.300 --> 07:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it shouldn't be a hazard
to navigation, but that's a
big part of what is going to

07:59.433 --> 08:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happen along with
the other research.

08:01.366 --> 08:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will be tracking to see
how this iceberg breaks up.

08:04.666 --> 08:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it will be a big
iceberg to start, and over
time it will get smaller.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
our iceberg man, Miles
O'Brien, thank you very much.

08:14.166 --> 08:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
You're welcome, Judy.
