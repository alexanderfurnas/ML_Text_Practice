JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Congress battles
with the president over budget
priorities

00:11.011 --> 00:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the face of a government
shutdown, as he
demands funding for a wall on
Mexico's border.

00:17.217 --> 00:23.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then: We travel to West
Virginia, where a
declining coal industry is
leaving retired

00:23.156 --> 00:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miners,many sick from working in
the mines,
in danger of losing their much
needed health

00:28.595 --> 00:30.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMON TUCKER, Former Coal Miner:
And it's
not like we're asking for a
handout or anything

00:32.499 --> 00:33.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
either.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was hard sweat work that --
benefits that
we negotiated.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all we want is just what was
promised
to us.

00:40.940 --> 00:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead:
Outsider candidates
sweep the French election -- a
look at the

00:47.047 --> 00:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
final two presidential hopefuls
who could
lead France.

00:51.885 --> 00:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg
speaks candidly
about recovering from the tragic
death of

00:57.590 --> 01:00.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
her husband and building
strength through
grief.

01:00.794 --> 01:04.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, Facebook:
And I learned
that resilience, it's not
something we have

01:04.197 --> 01:05.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one set amount of.

01:05.365 --> 01:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a muscle, and we build it.

01:07.867 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if this helps anyone even
just a little
bit, themselves or a friend,
then I think

01:13.506 --> 01:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will have found some meaning
in this.

01:15.175 --> 01:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:18.778 --> 01:22.015 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:22.048 --> 01:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The countdown is
on to a possible
government shutdown on Saturday,
President

01:36.729 --> 01:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump's 100th day in office.

01:39.466 --> 01:44.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress began returning to work
today facing
a presidential demand for
funding a wall on

01:44.804 --> 01:46.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Mexico border.

01:46.639 --> 01:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House and Democrats
argued today
over putting a down payment in
the continuing

01:51.878 --> 01:53.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resolution, or C.R.

01:53.680 --> 01:59.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
Obviously the money for military
and our border

01:59.886 --> 02:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security and wall have been part
of that request.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something that --
those are the
president's priorities heading
in -- with

02:05.592 --> 02:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
respect to the C.R. and keeping
the government
open.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we feel very confident
where we're
headed.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: If
administration insists on
funding for a wall

02:13.766 --> 02:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this bill, it will endanger
the prospects
of bill passing and raise the
prospects of

02:20.607 --> 02:27.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a government shutdown, because a
border wall
we believe is a pointless waste
of taxpayer

02:27.213 --> 02:28.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

02:28.615 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some Republicans
oppose money
for the wall as well.

02:32.685 --> 02:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats do want continued
federal payments
to make sure that the poor can
afford health

02:37.957 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coverage, but Republicans may
oppose that.

02:42.028 --> 02:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump called in
members of the U.N.
Security Council today, and
warned them that

02:46.633 --> 02:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the situation in North Korea is
unacceptable.

02:49.903 --> 02:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president met with the U.N.
ambassadors
over lunch at the White House.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said they may need to take
firm action.

02:56.042 --> 03:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The council must be prepared to
impose additional

03:00.079 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and stronger sanctions on North
Korean nuclear
and ballistic missile programs.

03:06.252 --> 03:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a real threat to the
world, whether
we want to talk about it or not.

03:11.191 --> 03:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea is a big world
problem, and it's
a problem we have to finally
solve.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People have put blindfolds on
for decades.

03:19.365 --> 03:24.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
complained that
the U.N. has not been resolving
conflicts,

03:24.470 --> 03:28.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he said -- quote -- "I think
that's going
to start happening now."

03:28.675 --> 03:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Barack Obama
has reemerged
urging compassion in dealing
with illegal

03:33.780 --> 03:35.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

03:35.582 --> 03:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke today at the University
of Chicago,
his first public appearance
since leaving

03:39.852 --> 03:41.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

03:41.654 --> 03:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without mentioning President
Trump by name,
Mr. Obama called for greater
understanding

03:45.558 --> 03:47.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a little historical
perspective.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United
States: It's not like everybody
in Ellis Island

03:50.196 --> 03:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had all their papers straight.

03:54.834 --> 04:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truth is, the history of our
immigration
system has always been a little
bit haphazard,

04:01.174 --> 04:03.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little bit loose.

04:03.042 --> 04:07.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The former
president said he
will also focus on issues like
gerrymandering

04:07.614 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and money in politics.

04:10.216 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Workers in New Orleans today
removed a statue
honoring an uprising by whites
after the Civil

04:16.222 --> 04:17.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The operation was carried out in
the wee hours,
but still sparked a protest.

04:20.960 --> 04:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The obelisk statue had been on
display, at
different sites, since 1891.

04:27.433 --> 04:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three monuments to Confederate
leaders will
be removed in the coming days.

04:31.938 --> 04:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate has confirmed former
Georgia Governor
Sonny Perdue to be secretary of
agriculture.

04:37.810 --> 04:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His nomination had been held up
for weeks
over ethics questions.

04:41.547 --> 04:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump nominees for trade
representative
and labor secretary are still
awaiting confirmation.

04:48.488 --> 04:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street rallied today, amid
hopes that
a centrist will win the French
presidential

04:53.192 --> 04:54.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

04:54.661 --> 04:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 216
points to close near 20764.

04:59.932 --> 05:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 73, and the S&amp;P
500 added
25.

05:06.773 --> 05:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And astronaut Peggy Whitson has
now broken
the American record for the most
accumulated

05:12.445 --> 05:14.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time in space.

05:14.180 --> 05:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As of today, she's spent more
than 534 days
in orbit.

05:19.319 --> 05:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, with daughter
Ivanka and
astronaut Kate Rubins,
congratulated Whitson

05:24.324 --> 05:27.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in a video call to the
International Space
Station.

05:27.894 --> 05:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's in command there, and
spoke alongside
fellow crew member Jack Fischer.

05:31.864 --> 05:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: This is a very
special day in
the glorious history of American
spaceflight.

05:36.736 --> 05:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEGGY WHITSON, NASA Astronaut:
It's actually
a huge honor to break a record
like this,

05:41.908 --> 05:50.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but it's an honor for me
basically to be representing
all the folks at NASA who make
this spaceflight

05:50.083 --> 05:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible and who make me setting
this record
feasible.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congratulations.

05:57.724 --> 06:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Whitson returns to
Earth this September,
she will have spent a total of
666 days in

06:02.895 --> 06:03.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
space.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The world record is 879 days.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's held by a Russian.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
broken promises?

06:11.437 --> 06:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- coal miners in danger of
losing their benefits;
insurance companies pushing
Congress to make

06:17.243 --> 06:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions on the nation's health
care; anti-establishment
candidates go head-to-head in
France's presidential

06:24.417 --> 06:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
election run-off; and much more.

06:37.363 --> 06:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Congress back in session,
members face
an end-of-the-week deadline to
keep the government

06:43.136 --> 06:45.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funded.

06:45.037 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To dig a little deeper into the
shutdown showdown,
we are joined by our
correspondents who cover

06:48.741 --> 06:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Capitol Hill and the White
House, Lisa Desjardins
and John Yang respectively.

06:53.980 --> 06:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thank you both for being
here in the studio
to talk about this complicated
stuff that's

06:58.584 --> 06:59.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, let me start with you.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the major sticking
points here when
it comes to this showdown talk?

07:03.823 --> 07:05.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There are a
few.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the top of the list is the
border wall.

07:06.659 --> 07:10.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The White House says it
absolutely wants funding
for that border wall.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats in Congress say they
will not support
it.

07:12.999 --> 07:16.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You need at least eight
Democrats to pass
a funding bill.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the Democrats say that they
are against
this.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also Republicans have a
problem with the
border wall.

07:21.174 --> 07:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, there are at least three
border state
Republicans who say they're
skeptical about

07:25.178 --> 07:26.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's other sticking points,
too, including
miners' benefits.

07:28.548 --> 07:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something Democrats they
are willing
to fight for as well, even if it
means a delay

07:32.685 --> 07:34.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in funding.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, you
have obviously
been talking to folks at the
White House.

07:36.422 --> 07:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they looking for?

07:37.423 --> 07:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they worried about?

07:38.825 --> 07:40.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And do they think they can turn
this at attitude
in Congress around?

07:40.593 --> 07:43.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Well, they're
confident the showdown
is not going to happen.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They certainly don't want it to
happen on
their 100th day in office.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that undercuts their
leverage a little
bit.

07:48.868 --> 07:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you will notice that they
have been very
careful about not drawing any
lines in the

07:53.239 --> 07:55.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sand.

07:55.074 --> 07:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump on Twitter talks
about funding
for the border wall, but when
you talk to

07:58.778 --> 08:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration officials, they
refer to it
as border security and suggest
that it could

08:03.115 --> 08:09.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
come in the form of more
Immigration Customs
Enforcement officers, could be
more drones.

08:09.188 --> 08:14.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could be anything along the
border that
would give them the ability to
say that this

08:14.193 --> 08:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bill reflects their priorities.

08:17.129 --> 08:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also has been very
careful not
to say that he wouldn't sign a
bill that doesn't

08:23.803 --> 08:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
include border -- money for the
border wall.

08:26.405 --> 08:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, if the
White House
is willing to redefine the wall,
turn it into

08:31.477 --> 08:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something called border security
along the
lines of what John described,
are Democrats

08:37.416 --> 08:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and those Republicans opposed
prepared to
give?

08:40.086 --> 08:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They say
they're considering
it.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats say they made an offer
to Republican
leaders yesterday and that they
haven't gotten

08:45.858 --> 08:47.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an offer back.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But this is all common.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's going to be a lot of
back and forth
over the next few days.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're open to that.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we need to watch this
miners' benefit
fight.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something that came up
four months
ago, the last time we had one of
these funding

08:58.538 --> 09:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cliffs, and Democrats said at
that time they
wanted a permanent extension of
these health

09:02.808 --> 09:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care benefits or else they would
delay or
stop funding.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we don't have a solution on
that either.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are all things in the mix
together.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And -- John.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We should also point
out the White
House is also being careful to
say that they

09:14.420 --> 09:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are willing to fund Democratic
priorities
that they don't like, so that
they're willing

09:19.025 --> 09:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see some give and take on
this.

09:20.826 --> 09:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And John, just
quickly, you
were saying a minute ago the
White House has

09:24.230 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essentially given up some
leverage here by
saying at the outset that they
don't want

09:28.000 --> 09:28.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a shutdown.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It would be bad
optics.

09:30.870 --> 09:34.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president says this 100-day
mark is arbitrary.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He calls it ridiculous.

09:36.709 --> 09:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, it would
look really
bad if this happened on the
100th day.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is an
ambitious White
House we're hearing from right
now, John.

09:44.784 --> 09:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are talking about wanting
what we have
just been discussing from the
budget, but

09:49.488 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're also talking about tax
reform this
week.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they looking for there?

09:53.059 --> 09:54.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I don't think you are
going to
see a lot of details.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's funny.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president this, that he
would announce
his tax reform plan on this
Wednesday just

09:59.332 --> 10:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about -- maybe just minutes
after Treasury
Secretary Mnuchin said it wasn't
going to

10:03.869 --> 10:05.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
come for quite a while.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think you're going to
see a lot of
details on Wednesday.

10:08.874 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Mnuchin, the National
Economic Council
chairman, Gary Cohn, are going
to the Hill

10:15.214 --> 10:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow to talk to Speaker
Ryan, Leader McConnell,
the leaders of the tax-writing
committees.

10:20.386 --> 10:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, the most you could
see is, I
think, probably guidelines,
broad principles,

10:26.559 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
middle-class tax cut,
simplification of the
tax code, making business rates
competitive,

10:33.165 --> 10:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which means cutting them, but
probably not
much more than that.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, what
are folks on
the Hill saying about this?

10:38.304 --> 10:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I was standing
next to Finance
Chairman Orrin Hatch, who has
been talking

10:41.173 --> 10:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the White House about tax
reform for a
long time.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he actually received a call
from the White
House when I was standing there.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he hasn't been briefed
on this plan
yet, on what they're going to
say tomorrow.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he says what John is
reporting.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It will be vague.

10:53.452 --> 10:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked, there's reports about
a 15 percent
corporate tax rate, that the
president wants

10:56.455 --> 10:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make that drastic cut.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To that, Hatch said, "I don't
think he will
get away with that."

11:01.460 --> 11:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, that would be too
much of a budget
buster.

11:03.295 --> 11:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's kind of already from
a Trump supporter
a problem for him.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is somebody
they'd normally
be counting on.

11:10.136 --> 11:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just quickly, less than a
minute, you
mentioned health care a minute
ago, John,

11:14.140 --> 11:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the White House is ready to
deal on that.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where are they in coming up with
a new health
care reform plan?

11:20.246 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They think that their
contribution
has been to get the conservative
Republicans

11:23.215 --> 11:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the moderate Republicans
talking to each
other.

11:25.351 --> 11:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say the vote is up to the
Hill, up to
the speaker, the majority leader
and the whip

11:30.056 --> 11:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
once they have the votes.

11:31.824 --> 11:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would love for it to happen
before the
100 days is up, but they also
realize that

11:35.628 --> 11:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keeping the government opening
and running
takes precedence.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you hear?

11:39.565 --> 11:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Judy, I woke to
a wide spectrum
of offices on Capitol Hill.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not there yet.

11:42.301 --> 11:43.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe tomorrow night.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Freedom Caucus has an
important meeting.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say there's a little bit of
optimism
among Republicans.

11:47.473 --> 11:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this whole year, Judy, they
have been
big on aspiration, short on
votes.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

11:53.012 --> 11:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I know both of you are
going to be following
it all this week, Lisa
Desjardins, John Yang.

11:56.882 --> 12:01.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Lisa, stay with us, because
you mentioned
this West Virginia coal miners
issue several

12:02.021 --> 12:02.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

12:03.022 --> 12:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have actually done
reporting.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have been to West Virginia.

12:05.591 --> 12:06.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tell us more.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just got back from West
Virginia over the
weekend.

12:09.662 --> 12:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Trump, as you
know, has campaigned
on a promise to reverse the
fortunes of coal

12:14.100 --> 12:15.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That message especially
resonated in West
Virginia, where he swept every
single county

12:18.437 --> 12:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in last year's elections.

12:20.272 --> 12:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now thousands of miners are
in jeopardy
of losing their health care if
Congress doesn't

12:24.944 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
act.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is another installment in
our ongoing
Chasing the Dream series on
poverty and opportunity

12:29.982 --> 12:32.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in America.

12:32.818 --> 12:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many stories about mining start
here, a coal
yard in Appalachia.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this story starts here in a
front yard.

12:42.928 --> 12:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After 27 years underground,
former miner Damon
Tucker left with a list of
health problems

12:48.200 --> 12:49.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and frustrations.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAMON TUCKER, Former Coal Miner:
I told my
wife.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said, I will flip hamburgers.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will draw my pension and flip
hamburgers
if I have to.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not -- I'm coming out of the
mines.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Flipping
hamburgers didn't
happen.

13:03.182 --> 13:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lawn care did with his own
one-man business
near Beckley, West Virginia.

13:08.154 --> 13:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Tucker, who had open heart
surgery just
over a year ago, still depends
on his miners

13:13.692 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health plan.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what would it mean if your
health care
benefits just stopped?

13:18.798 --> 13:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMON TUCKER: Well, you know, I
will take
what medicine I can afford to
pay right now,

13:24.003 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but my follow-up visits with
doctors and stuff,
I won't -- I won't go.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I -- you know, I won't be able
to afford to
go.

13:33.712 --> 13:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some 22,000
retired union
miners and their widows will
lose their health

13:39.585 --> 13:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care if Congress doesn't act.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many have chronic lung diseases.

13:43.589 --> 13:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their union benefit health plan
supports clinics
like this in Southern West
Virginia and helps

13:48.327 --> 13:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them pay their medical costs.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Take a deep breath in.

13:53.032 --> 14:00.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These retired
miners say
the federal government
guaranteed this health

14:00.139 --> 14:06.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care at a key moment 70 years
ago, 1946.

14:06.779 --> 14:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a massive miner strike
threatened the
power grid, President Truman did
something

14:11.183 --> 14:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
historic: He stepped in to forge
a deal where
coal companies and the mining
union agreed

14:16.522 --> 14:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fund lifelong health care and
pensions.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I blame the government more
than I do
the coal companies.

14:22.361 --> 14:26.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: That
last-century promise
is colliding with today's
funding problem

14:26.432 --> 14:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and critical health needs at a

the 1st of next month.

14:35.341 --> 14:41.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if they don't pass that
bill, then the
1st of the next month, I won't
have no insurance.

14:41.213 --> 14:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

breathing and
everything's getting better, but
it's not.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's getting worse.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It'll take us going back to
Washington,
and protesting, and letting them
know how

14:52.691 --> 14:54.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we feel.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to let the government

all promised that.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We supposed to get that.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: How did this
happen?

14:59.398 --> 15:04.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the coal industry declined,
there were
fewer miners paying into the
system, and more

15:04.103 --> 15:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
miners retiring and drawing on
their benefits.

15:07.239 --> 15:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starting in the 1990s, coal
companies used
bankruptcy filings as a way to
stop paying

15:12.177 --> 15:14.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their portion of the benefits.

15:14.747 --> 15:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All that led to shortfalls, and
while government
never intended to pay for these
benefits,

15:20.085 --> 15:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress has become a kind of
funder of last
resort, and has stepped in
multiple times

15:24.990 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make up the difference.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that brings us to today.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miners' fates are yet again in
the hands of
Washington politicians.

15:31.897 --> 15:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, notably, this time, miners'
health benefits
run out as another deadline
hits, the deadline

15:38.003 --> 15:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to fund most of government.

a permanent

16:08.767 --> 16:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

don't shut government

16:56.749 --> 16:58.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

17:04.089 --> 17:07.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL GRESZLER: If the

now and says, just because you
performed a

17:07.693 --> 17:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

mining is
crucial to our country, we're
going to bail

17:18.337 --> 17:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

health benefits

17:47.066 --> 17:48.801 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

debate over health care coverage
is tied to

19:35.040 --> 19:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the larger political battle.

19:37.342 --> 19:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Specifically, the president must
decide whether
he will continue to make
payments to insurance

19:42.714 --> 19:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies to cover out-of-pocket
costs and
deductibles for low-income
consumers.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration lost a
crucial court
ruling that concluded those
payments were

19:52.758 --> 19:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not constitutional unless
authorized by Congress.

20:15.447 --> 20:19.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, remind us,
325 million
Americans, only seven million of
them receive

20:19.751 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these subsidies.

20:20.752 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Yes.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why does this
matter so much?

20:23.589 --> 20:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Well, first of
all, there
are 20 million people in the
individual health

20:25.424 --> 20:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance market, so it does
affect 20 million
people.

20:29.228 --> 20:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the subsidies, the Trump
administration
can cut them off tomorrow
morning.

20:33.765 --> 20:38.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To the typical insurance
company, that could
be worth about $8 million a
month they'd lose,

20:38.103 --> 20:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they still have to
provide the benefits.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what the insurance company
does, if this
gets cut off overnight, is that
they will

20:45.010 --> 20:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to increase the rates not
just for the
seven million in the exchange,
but the 20

20:49.615 --> 20:51.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million in the individual health
insurance
market.

20:51.850 --> 20:56.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that could easily lead to 15
percent rate
increases on top of significant
rate increases

20:56.989 --> 20:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are likely to come in 2018
for Obamacare.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's try to
humanize this.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who exactly are the people who
benefit from
this?

21:03.862 --> 21:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: The poorest
people who get
health insurance through the
Affordable Care

21:07.699 --> 21:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Act, or Obamacare's insurance
exchanges, these
are people that as an individual
can make

21:12.971 --> 21:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$12,000 a year to $24,000 a
year.

21:16.108 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are people who are such
low-income that
they need help with the
deductibles and the

21:21.980 --> 21:23.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
co-pays.

21:23.415 --> 21:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how much
money are we talking
about is involved?

21:26.418 --> 21:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have seen $130-some-billion.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Yes, it's
about $1,000 per
person.

21:30.889 --> 21:31.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A year?

21:31.890 --> 21:33.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Yes.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

21:34.526 --> 21:37.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: So, it's a
huge amount of
money for that individual.

21:37.929 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a huge amount of money to
the insurance
company that is providing it,
because the

21:40.832 --> 21:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance company, by law, has
to provide
the money even if the federal
government doesn't

21:44.102 --> 21:45.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pay for it.

21:45.937 --> 21:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they get hit to the tune of
maybe $8 million
a month for every 100,000 people
they cover.

21:50.676 --> 21:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, right now,
President Trump
appears to be dangling this
as...

21:54.179 --> 21:55.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Yes.

21:56.014 --> 21:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You could call it
a bargaining
chip in his negotiations over
the budget with

21:59.785 --> 22:00.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Congress.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Right.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would happen
if this money
just stops flowing?

22:04.389 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happens?

22:06.291 --> 22:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: The first
thing that happens
is people's benefits continue to
flow to them.

22:09.594 --> 22:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cost-sharing would continue
to at least
the end of the year, because the
insurance

22:14.066 --> 22:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company has to provide the
support.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the money would come out of
the insurance
company's pocket.

22:19.004 --> 22:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The insurance company would then
turn around
and increase rates for 2018,
probably about

22:24.209 --> 22:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15 percent just for this, in
addition to probably
15 percent rate increases
typically that Obamacare

22:30.215 --> 22:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would get in 2018 anyway.

22:32.117 --> 22:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what happens
to these exchanges
at the national -- the federal
exchange and

22:36.788 --> 22:38.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the state exchanges?

22:38.623 --> 22:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Well, health
insurance companies
have generally been losing a lot
of money

22:41.259 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the health insurance
exchanges.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This would make things far
worse.

22:44.396 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have already got a
teetering, relatively
unstable situation going on now.

22:49.901 --> 22:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fundamental problem with
Obamacare is,
we haven't gotten enough healthy
people to

22:53.972 --> 22:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sign up to pay the claims for
the sick.

22:56.441 --> 22:58.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an imbalanced pool.

22:58.243 --> 23:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the Trump administration
would throw a
grenade into the middle of that
and make it

23:02.614 --> 23:03.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even more unbalanced.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
exchanges, some of
them could collapse?

23:05.984 --> 23:06.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's what...

23:06.985 --> 23:08.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:08.387 --> 23:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: I doubt you
would see the
exchanges collapse.

23:10.122 --> 23:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get the into the weeds of how
all this
works, but the bottom line is,
the insurance

23:14.159 --> 23:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies would dramatically
increase the
rates for all 20 million in the
pool.

23:18.997 --> 23:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would make things even more
expensive.

23:21.066 --> 23:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We would have even fewer healthy
people, and
which would, in turn, make
things even more

23:25.070 --> 23:27.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
expensive next year.

23:27.038 --> 23:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It continues to make things
unstable.

23:30.075 --> 23:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, Judy, typically, a
family of four,
mom and dad age 40, right now,
would have

23:35.580 --> 23:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pay about $10,000 in premium
for a plan
with a $7,000 deductible.

23:40.952 --> 23:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the cheapest plan for
people who don't
get subsidies.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And half the people don't get
subsidies.

23:45.957 --> 23:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what this would is, it would
just tend
-- it would make this far worse.

23:52.297 --> 23:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obamacare is not stable, in the
sense that
it's not delivering efficient
health insurance

23:56.134 --> 23:57.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
costs, and it would make that
even worse.

23:57.569 --> 23:59.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what it would do.

23:59.337 --> 24:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who is arguing to
the White
House to keep these payments
going, and who's

24:04.075 --> 24:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arguing -- trying to stop them?

24:06.378 --> 24:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: I don't know
of anybody
who is arguing that the
administration should

24:09.481 --> 24:11.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stop them.

24:11.216 --> 24:16.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My sense is, not only do
Democrats -- are
they dead set against stopping
them, but the

24:16.922 --> 24:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican leadership, members
of the Republican
Congress privately are saying:
We can't do

24:22.227 --> 24:23.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

24:23.495 --> 24:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would we make an unstable
situation even
much worse?

24:27.566 --> 24:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this playing
out?

24:30.168 --> 24:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When do you see this -- we know
the president
is saying it could happen now,
but what are

24:35.240 --> 24:36.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you seeing in the terms of the
timeline?

24:36.908 --> 24:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Well, the
president has
dangled this twice now.

24:40.645 --> 24:46.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once, he has said to the
Democrats, you need
to come to the table and
negotiate repeal

24:46.418 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and replace bill with me, if you
don't, I
will stop the subsidies.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was last week.

24:51.823 --> 24:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, he said, in order to
get the budget
done, I need the wall -- I need
the Mexican

24:56.294 --> 25:00.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall money, and I will give you
the subsidies
if you give me the Mexican wall
money.

25:00.565 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now spent the subsidies
twice, from a
political perspective.

25:05.103 --> 25:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is all about resolving
the budget
impasse and all about resolving
the repeal

25:09.541 --> 25:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and replace challenge that the
Republicans
are dealing with.

25:12.711 --> 25:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until that's -- those two
things are resolved,
this is going to be an issue
that people are

25:16.348 --> 25:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to be worrying about.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a tough one.

25:18.817 --> 25:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Yes, it is.

25:21.953 --> 25:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Laszewski,
we thank
you very much.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT LASZEWSKI: Thank you.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:34.666 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a

President Obama's first public
appearance

25:52.250 --> 25:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after her husband's death.

25:54.352 --> 26:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Voters went to the
polls yesterday
in France, the first of two
rounds to elect

26:00.759 --> 26:02.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a new president.

26:02.661 --> 26:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The field was winnowed to two
candidates,
neither from the establishment
political parties

26:07.732 --> 26:09.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that have governed France for
decades.

26:09.968 --> 26:16.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sets up a May 7 tete-a-tete
run-off between
a centrist newcomer and the face
of the far

26:16.374 --> 26:17.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

26:17.642 --> 26:20.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Paris, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

26:20.478 --> 26:24.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The two
candidates still
standing emerged this morning to
crowds of

26:24.849 --> 26:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters, centrist Emmanuel
Macron and Marine
Le Pen, leader of the far-right
National Front.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She fired the first broadside in
the northern
town of Rouvroy.

26:38.029 --> 26:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINE LE PEN, President,
National Front Party
(through translator): The
reality is that

26:42.033 --> 26:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Macron is not a patriot in
any way at
all.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is a hysterical, radical
Europeanist.

26:47.539 --> 26:48.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is for total open borders.

26:48.974 --> 26:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sunday's
opening round saw
a 78 percent turnout.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Macron won 24 percent of the
vote.

26:54.546 --> 26:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Le Pen followed with 21 percent,
while conservative
Francois Fillon finished with 20
percent.

27:00.018 --> 27:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And far-left candidate Jean-Luc
Melenchon
had 19.

27:06.391 --> 27:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the scene last night in
Paris as
news of Macron's first-place
finish reached

27:10.729 --> 27:12.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his supporters.

27:12.998 --> 27:18.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was the countdown to
the final round
in Le Pen's headquarters in the
Northern French

27:18.570 --> 27:21.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rust belt town of
Henin-Beaumont.

27:21.373 --> 27:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Front supporters had
been expecting
her to take first place, and hid
their disappointment,

27:26.645 --> 27:28.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chanting, "We will win."

27:28.213 --> 27:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It's
the mobilization
of the people.

27:32.584 --> 27:35.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been fighting for the same
cause for
years, defending the people.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marine will be president.

27:38.456 --> 27:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Several times,
the Front
supporters burst into "The
Marseillaise,"

27:43.228 --> 27:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the French national anthem.

27:45.797 --> 27:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campaign staffer Mikael Sala
resents accusations
that the party is racist and
insists that

27:51.069 --> 27:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Le Pen can be president for
French people
of all ethnicities.

27:53.972 --> 27:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKAEL SALA, Le Pen Adviser:
Wherever you
come from, she's said a zillion
times that

27:58.710 --> 28:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she considers every French
woman, every French
man as being equal.

28:04.115 --> 28:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But political
analyst Alexandra
de Hoop Scheffer believes that
Le Pen has

28:09.020 --> 28:10.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
progressed as far as she can go.

28:10.922 --> 28:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRA DE HOOP SCHEFFER,
Political Analyst:
people realize that in the
Brexit, post-Trump

28:17.562 --> 28:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election context, probably, they
won't want
to follow that trend.

28:22.367 --> 28:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Macron has a smart way of
portraying his
mission, which is to show that
France is a

28:31.676 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
contrarian.

28:33.511 --> 28:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: She supports
the popular
thesis that Macron will probably
win the second

28:36.314 --> 28:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
round with about 60 percent of
the vote.

28:39.250 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marine Le Pen's success may have
ended decades
of political domination by the
traditional

28:43.955 --> 28:45.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parties of the left and right.

28:45.990 --> 28:49.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But France's political
establishment is in
a vengeful mood.

28:49.794 --> 28:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leadership of both the
Republican and
the Socialist parties have
described her candidacy

28:54.933 --> 29:01.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as destructive and have
encouraged their supporters
to vote for Emmanuel Macron.

29:01.473 --> 29:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sitting President Francois
Hollande, whose
Socialist Party had a disastrous
showing,

29:05.977 --> 29:07.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was one of those voices.

29:07.712 --> 29:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): There is a clear
choice.

29:11.549 --> 29:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emmanuel Macron is the candidate
who enables
the French people to come
together at this

29:16.554 --> 29:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment, which is so unusual, so
serious.

29:18.857 --> 29:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Meanwhile,
European financial
markets surged with the news
that Macron,

29:24.028 --> 29:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who opposes withdrawal from the
European Union,
had come out on top.

29:27.732 --> 29:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, the vice president of Le
Pen's party,
Steeve Briois, is convinced that
Le Pen will

29:32.570 --> 29:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pick up working-class support
from the hard-left
candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon.

29:36.541 --> 29:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEEVE BRIOIS, National Front
Party (through
translator): A lot of
Melenchon's voters who

29:40.979 --> 29:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voted for him because of anger
will be able
to vote for us in 15 days,
because they won't

29:45.750 --> 29:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote for an ultra-liberal, such
as Mr. Macron.

29:48.119 --> 29:52.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Jean-Yves
Camus, a specialist
in right-wing politics, believes
that's an

29:52.357 --> 29:54.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
illusion.

29:54.159 --> 29:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-YVES CAMUS, Political
Analyst: There's
no way she can be elected,
unless, of course,

29:56.161 --> 30:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a huge political earthquake
or something
really nasty such as a terrorist
attack.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These National
Front supporters
were partying as if the ultimate
prize was

30:06.171 --> 30:08.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a foregone conclusion.

30:08.072 --> 30:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But most people headed home
early, as reality
sank in that they have a major
battle on their

30:12.210 --> 30:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hands if they're to emulate the
victories
of Brexit and Donald Trump.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in France.

JUDY WOODRUFF: More than a
decade- and-a-half
into the U.S. war in
Afghanistan, the country

30:34.098 --> 30:36.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
remains wracked by instability.

30:36.868 --> 30:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, the Taliban reminded
the world
that it remains a force to be
reckoned with.

30:41.573 --> 30:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of the top national security
officials
in the Trump administration have
just visited

30:46.411 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

30:49.414 --> 30:53.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The defense
secretary's
surprise visit to Kabul
underscored growing

30:53.451 --> 30:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. concerns about Afghanistan.

30:56.321 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Mattis made that clear
after meeting
with President Ashraf Ghani and
other leaders.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MATTIS, U.S. Secretary of
Defense: 2017
is going to be another tough
year for the

31:03.027 --> 31:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
valiant Afghan Security Forces
and the international
troops who have stood and will
continue to

31:09.367 --> 31:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand shoulder to shoulder with
Afghanistan
against terrorism.

31:13.371 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just three
days before,
Taliban fighters, disguised as
government

31:17.675 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troops, killed at least 140
Afghan soldiers.

31:21.579 --> 31:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials believe the final
death toll will
be higher, making this the
single deadliest

31:25.483 --> 31:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack on an Afghan base in
years.

31:28.086 --> 31:30.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened at a compound in
northern Balkh
province.

31:30.855 --> 31:35.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Also today, at
least four
security guards were killed when
a suicide

31:35.226 --> 31:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bomber hit a U.S.-operated base
in the east
of the country, all this amid
reports that

31:40.431 --> 31:45.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia is funneling weapons to
the Taliban,
something the top U.S. commander
in Afghanistan

31:45.904 --> 31:46.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
essentially confirmed.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON, Commander U.S.
Forces, Afghanistan:
We had the overt legitimacy lent
to the Taliban

31:51.943 --> 31:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Russian that really
occurred during
late last year beginning through
this process

31:58.149 --> 31:59.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have been undertaking.

31:59.951 --> 32:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So, to be clear, you
are not refuting
that they are sending weapons?

32:03.855 --> 32:04.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

32:04.889 --> 32:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON: Oh, no, I am not
refuting
that.

32:06.157 --> 32:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Russia has
denied aiding
the insurgents.

32:07.825 --> 32:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it lends urgency to the U.S.
decision
whether to deploy more American
troops in

32:12.063 --> 32:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a war that's now in its 16th
year.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the situation in
Afghanistan,
we turn to David Sedney, who was
deputy assistant

32:20.538 --> 32:26.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
secretary of defense for
Afghanistan, Pakistan
and Central Asia during the
Obama administration.

32:26.611 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now acting president of the
American
University of Afghanistan, and
joins us via

32:31.082 --> 32:33.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Skype from Kabul.

32:33.318 --> 32:35.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Sedney, thank you very
much for being
here.

32:35.253 --> 32:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can we -- let's talk first about
this attack
on Friday.

32:38.856 --> 32:45.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Afghan forces have already
lost thousands
of soldiers to the Taliban over
the last few

32:45.363 --> 32:46.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How significant is Friday's
attack?

32:48.366 --> 32:50.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY, Former Defense
Department Official:
I would have to say that this is
a very significant

32:50.268 --> 32:51.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

32:52.003 --> 32:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is probably the largest
attack the Taliban
have ever carried out on Afghan
forces.

32:55.940 --> 33:02.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was done with a kind of
sophistication
and planning that I think even
surprised many

33:02.413 --> 33:04.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people here.

33:04.182 --> 33:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it shows the Taliban have a
reach and
a capability that is something
that people

33:09.253 --> 33:10.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just didn't expect.

33:11.022 --> 33:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you say,
this attack
shows, I don't know if you want
to call it

33:13.124 --> 33:15.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the audacity, but the audacity
of the Taliban.

33:15.760 --> 33:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is also, is it not,
something of an
indictment of the Afghan forces
to have allowed

33:21.165 --> 33:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the infiltrators who helped
perpetuate this
attack and to allow themselves
to be caught

33:24.902 --> 33:26.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off-guard like this?

33:26.371 --> 33:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: Well, I think
certainly shows
a failure of intelligence.

33:29.574 --> 33:34.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shows that there needs to be
improved leadership
on the Afghan forces.

33:35.013 --> 33:41.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have to say that the
Afghan forces have
fought bravely and well in
repeated engagements

33:41.052 --> 33:46.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Taliban over the last
several years,
after, to be frank, the Obama
administration

33:46.691 --> 33:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a too hasty and poorly
planned withdrawal,
leaving the Afghan forces
without the kind

33:51.896 --> 33:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of support and the kind of
leadership that
they needed.

33:54.499 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously, we
need as robust
an Afghan fighting force as we
can to counter

33:59.370 --> 34:00.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Taliban.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think this kind of an
attack will hurt
recruitment going forward?

34:03.574 --> 34:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: I don't think it
will hurt recruitment.

34:05.843 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the experience that I
have seen here
is, after attack, recruitment
tends to go

34:10.481 --> 34:11.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

34:11.482 --> 34:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the real issue here is not
recruitment.

34:12.917 --> 34:17.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The real issue here is
leadership, leadership
and mentoring.

34:17.188 --> 34:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Afghan forces have a real
large number
of very capable junior and
middle-level officers

34:23.327 --> 34:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the United States and our
allies have
played a major role in training.

34:26.931 --> 34:31.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the upper levels of
leadership is an area
where we have not given the kind
of sustained

34:31.569 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attention over the last decade
or so.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where the real
problems lie.

34:37.442 --> 34:42.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why, as you mentioned
earlier,
the minister of defense, the
chief of staff

34:42.513 --> 34:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and some other senior generals
have been replaced.

34:45.049 --> 34:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would have to say, many
people here
believe it's well past time that
that kind

34:49.187 --> 34:50.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of change in leadership
happened.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: More broadly,
the top U.S.
commander there, General John
Nicholson, said

34:53.958 --> 34:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the security situation in
Afghanistan
is at a stalemate.

34:57.962 --> 35:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wonder, do you agree with
that assessment?

35:00.665 --> 35:02.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDNEY: Yes, I do.

35:02.600 --> 35:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a situation where the
Afghan security
forces are able to prevail in
direct engagements

35:08.272 --> 35:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Taliban, but because of
continuing
support from Pakistan, because
of the Taliban's

35:14.779 --> 35:20.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to strike anywhere
anytime, and because
of weakness in enablers,
particularly air

35:20.251 --> 35:24.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and intelligence, the Afghans
forces haven't
been able to gain an advantage
on the battleground.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We mentioned
also at the
returning that the Russians have
been supporting

35:28.626 --> 35:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Taliban increasingly.

35:30.528 --> 35:33.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you help us understand, why
do the Russians
want to support them?

35:33.331 --> 35:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: The Russians see
Afghanistan
as an area, I believe, where
they can try

35:39.604 --> 35:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and take advantage of the United
States, try
and drive a wedge between us and
some of our

35:43.708 --> 35:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allies, and also an area where
they have the
ability to strengthen their
long-term strategic

35:51.282 --> 35:53.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

35:53.117 --> 35:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly,
General Nicholson
also said, in order to break
this stalemate,

35:55.753 --> 35:59.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
billions of dollars and
thousands more U.S.
troops might be needed.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that will do it?

36:01.459 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that is granted, if the money
comes, if
the troops come, will that fix
this?

36:05.863 --> 36:12.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SEDNEY: I think that those
are important
components, but there are two
other equally

36:12.837 --> 36:14.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or I would actually say more
important components.

36:14.839 --> 36:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is improved Afghan
leadership, both
at the ministry level and at the
corps level

36:21.779 --> 36:23.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the military.

36:23.548 --> 36:28.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There really needs to be a
replacement of
many of older generals that
should have been

36:28.119 --> 36:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
retired many years ago, and
younger leaders
need to be moved up.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But finally and most importantly
is the role
of Pakistan.

36:37.328 --> 36:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pakistan's support for the
Taliban is what
makes them as capable as they
are, the ability

36:42.466 --> 36:51.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have arms, armed men,
explosives sent across
the border, with no restrictions
at all from

36:51.742 --> 36:55.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pakistan, that's what's enabled
the Taliban
to continue to fight the way
they have.

36:55.947 --> 37:00.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until that safe haven in
Pakistan is addressed
one way or another, this
conflict is going

37:00.184 --> 37:01.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to continue.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
David Sedney,
acting president of the American
University

37:03.988 --> 37:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Afghanistan, thank you very
much.

37:06.624 --> 37:14.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDNEY: Thank you,
William.

37:14.365 --> 37:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we turn back
to the political
fight brewing over government
funding, health

37:21.739 --> 37:27.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
care and tax reform, as
President Trump nears
his 100th day in office.

37:27.578 --> 37:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all that, it's time for
Politics Monday
with Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report

37:32.717 --> 37:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Tamara Keith of NPR, who
joins us tonight
from Chicago.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

37:39.056 --> 37:42.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, 100 days, we're coming up on
it this Saturday.

37:42.727 --> 37:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, during the campaign, the
president said
he was going to get a lot done
during those

37:46.597 --> 37:48.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first 100 days.

37:48.132 --> 37:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then, just a few days ago,
he was saying
it's a ridiculous standard.

37:51.535 --> 37:52.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:52.970 --> 37:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Right,
an arbitrary standard.

37:53.671 --> 37:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what is it?

37:54.538 --> 37:55.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How important is it?

37:55.539 --> 37:56.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much attention should we
give it?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, it's a very
good question.

37:58.309 --> 38:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, normally, president,
especially
-- first-term presidents start
off in their

38:01.412 --> 38:04.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first few months in office with
this reservoir
of goodwill.

38:04.582 --> 38:07.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think of it like having a bank
account that
you're flush with cash.

38:07.285 --> 38:12.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you spend that money down
and that
goodwill down over the course of
your presidency

38:12.356 --> 38:14.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get things done.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump is starting in a
very different
place.

38:16.060 --> 38:19.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has got to find a way to fill
that reservoir
because, right now, it's empty.

38:19.997 --> 38:24.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's sitting at anywhere between
40 percent
and 42 percent approval, the
lowest for any

38:24.835 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president at this point in his
tenure, for
a first-term president in his
tenure.

38:30.274 --> 38:34.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question which, Judy,
I feel like
we have been asking since the
day he that

38:34.478 --> 38:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won this election is how does he
fill that
reservoir because, right now, he
hasn't done

38:38.349 --> 38:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a particularly good job of it.

38:40.885 --> 38:43.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam, you not
only cover
Washington.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You cover the American people.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You hit the road.

38:47.792 --> 38:51.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you sense the importance
of this measurement,
this 100 days?

38:51.696 --> 38:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It is
an arbitrary measure.

38:56.834 --> 39:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is based on, you know, the
Roosevelt administration
had -- FDR's administration had
incredible

39:04.875 --> 39:06.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accomplishments.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that was done with Congress,
and a lot
of it didn't originate from the
White House.

39:10.214 --> 39:15.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One historian I talked to last
week said that
even Roosevelt wouldn't have
meet the standard.

39:15.052 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And yet every president is held
to this standard.

39:17.888 --> 39:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with President Trump
is that he
made big all of these very
promises, and specifically

39:23.227 --> 39:27.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
labeled it as his 100-days plan
that he was
campaigning on.

39:27.565 --> 39:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, as the talk of 100
days heated
up last week, I was chatting
with a Trump

39:33.871 --> 39:39.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voter who said to me, you know,
in my machine
shop, when we get somebody new,
we don't expect

39:39.944 --> 39:42.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them to be able to do everything
on the first
day.

39:42.046 --> 39:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that there are a lot
of Trump
voters out there I have heard
from who say,

39:46.550 --> 39:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you know, give him a chance.

39:48.652 --> 39:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a very steep learning
curve when it
comes to running the United
States.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, it is
like everything
else.

39:55.459 --> 39:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So much of this is in the eye of
the beholder.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, that's exactly
right.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the learning curve
thing is very
important.

40:00.364 --> 40:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, this is the first
president we have
elected in our time who has
never held political

40:06.470 --> 40:10.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
office and who's never had
military office.

40:10.341 --> 40:11.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

40:11.342 --> 40:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a big learning curve.

40:13.043 --> 40:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people around him has a
learning curve
and Congress has a learning
curve.

40:14.945 --> 40:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the Republicans in
Congress have never
worked with a Republican
president before.

40:19.216 --> 40:23.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, structurally, though, that's
first this
president I think has time to
sort of right

40:23.521 --> 40:25.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the ship.

40:25.322 --> 40:28.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first 100 days to me not as
important
as the next 100 or 200 or 400 as
we get closer

40:28.959 --> 40:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the midterm elections.

40:30.761 --> 40:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Structurally, his advantage is
that this as
a president who has all levers
of power in

40:35.099 --> 40:36.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have the House.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have the Senate.

40:38.903 --> 40:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while I agree that there is
a learning
curve and people are going to
cut them some

40:41.405 --> 40:46.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slack, saying you're few, get
some notches,
take some time before you can
put some notches

40:46.710 --> 40:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on your belt, at some point, if
you have all
the levers of power and you're
still not able

40:51.315 --> 40:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get anything done, I think
that's going
to be a problem.

40:53.851 --> 40:57.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Part of what you
have been
both have referring to, Tam, is
he's raised

40:57.488 --> 40:59.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
expectations himself.

40:59.290 --> 41:04.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been hearing analysts
in the last
few days, and reading them,
saying he needs

41:04.462 --> 41:06.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to lower expectations.

41:07.031 --> 41:12.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do have a sense, don't
we, coming out
of these first three months of
what kind of

41:12.570 --> 41:14.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
presidency this is going to be?

41:14.572 --> 41:15.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't we?

41:15.573 --> 41:17.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haven't we learned something
from this?

41:17.308 --> 41:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: We have certainly
learned how
President Trump operates.

41:21.812 --> 41:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He operates on sort of an ad hoc
basis, that
the White House, that Oval
Office is very

41:27.518 --> 41:33.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
open, that he brings people in,
that he is
very available, that he does --
for all of

41:33.691 --> 41:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his talk of the lying media and
the fake news,
he does a huge number of
interviews, where

41:38.362 --> 41:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's more available than past
presidents.

41:42.132 --> 41:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we don't know is if
that is how he
will govern for the rest of his
term.

41:47.204 --> 41:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He talks about being a very
flexible person.

41:51.141 --> 41:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we with simply don't know if
that flexibility
means that he will change again.

41:54.945 --> 42:00.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, like President Clinton
started off
with a very rough first 100
days.

42:00.417 --> 42:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People widely described it as
disastrous.

42:03.387 --> 42:09.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, he changed chiefs of
staff and
changed the way he ran his White
House, and

42:09.260 --> 42:15.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, having lost the Congress,
cooperated
with Republicans in Congress and
got some

42:15.466 --> 42:16.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things done.

42:17.001 --> 42:19.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy,
presidents do learn
from their mistakes, don't they?

42:19.370 --> 42:20.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's the goal.

42:21.005 --> 42:21.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:22.006 --> 42:23.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

42:23.607 --> 42:27.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to Tamara's point about
President Clinton,
he did -- that was a rough 1993.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in 1994, it's not just that
he had a bad
midterm election.

42:31.015 --> 42:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His party lost control of the
House, for the
first time in 40 years.

42:35.319 --> 42:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, to me, what I'm looking
at in terms
of the number is not just where
he is, President

42:40.891 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump is in comparison to where
other presidents
were in their first 100 days.

42:43.727 --> 42:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I look at the number
where he is
now, at 40 or 42 percent, and
look at where

42:47.698 --> 42:53.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other presidents were close to
their midterm
elections who were at 40 percent
or 42 percent,

42:53.304 --> 42:55.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they lost lots of seats in
Congress.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In many cases, they low control
of Congress.

42:57.908 --> 43:01.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it is imperative for him to
start getting
some wins.

43:01.512 --> 43:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Structurally, he has the ability
to do it,
but now he has got to start
delivering.

43:04.381 --> 43:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he has got to
make up some
ground.

43:06.517 --> 43:07.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

43:07.751 --> 43:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tam, we did note
that you're
in Chicago.

43:11.288 --> 43:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama was there today
to make his
first sort of public
presentation since leaving

43:16.994 --> 43:17.962 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what did you see?

43:19.964 --> 43:24.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, what I saw
is a post-president
who is trying his best to not
talk about his

43:24.902 --> 43:26.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successor.

43:26.637 --> 43:31.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was on stage with six young
people who
are active in -- sort of
civically active.

43:31.809 --> 43:36.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said that he believes
that a big part
of his post-presidency will be
to try to figure

43:36.313 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out how to get the next
generation involved
in public life and giving back
and in politics.

43:42.753 --> 43:48.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about concerns about
people simply
not voting or becoming cynical.

43:48.058 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what he didn't talk about
was President
Trump.

43:51.028 --> 43:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for those people who were
hoping that
President Obama would come back
into public

43:54.865 --> 44:00.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life and join the resistance,
that doesn't
appear to be how he plans to
spend his post-presidency.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds like he is
holding off.

44:02.106 --> 44:03.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

44:03.874 --> 44:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, there's a great irony, of
course, in
President Obama as a face of the
resistance.

44:07.177 --> 44:12.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked throughout the Obama
era about the
so-called Obama coalition
voters.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But guess what?

44:13.984 --> 44:17.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those voters, who included a lot
of young
people, only turned out for one
Democrat,

44:17.421 --> 44:18.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that was Barack Obama.

44:18.856 --> 44:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't turn out in midterm
elections.

44:20.691 --> 44:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't turn in the way that
Democrats
had hoped for Hillary Clinton.

44:25.696 --> 44:28.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will they then turn out for
another Democrat
is the big question.

44:28.432 --> 44:32.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of
Democrats are holding
their breath, crossing their
fingers, or whatever

44:32.336 --> 44:33.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people do when they're hoping.

44:33.937 --> 44:36.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See you next Monday.

44:38.175 --> 44:42.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

44:42.813 --> 44:47.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

44:47.484 --> 44:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a conversation
with Sheryl Sandberg about
coping with grief

44:53.857 --> 44:56.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and resilience in the face of
adversity.

44:56.627 --> 45:01.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the subject of a new book
in which
she writes candidly about a
personal tragedy,

45:01.465 --> 45:04.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the loss of her husband, Dave
Goldberg.

45:04.301 --> 45:08.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I visited her at Facebook's
headquarters in
Menlo Park, California.

45:08.639 --> 45:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our interview took place nearly
two years
after Sandberg and her husband
went on vacation

45:13.677 --> 45:16.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Mexico with friends.

45:16.213 --> 45:21.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sandberg woke up from a poolside
nap, saw
that Dave wasn't there, and soon
went looking

45:21.618 --> 45:23.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him.

45:23.754 --> 45:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She found him lying on the floor
of the hotel
gym next to the treadmill.

45:28.425 --> 45:32.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As they later learned, he had
suffered a cardiac
arrhythmia.

45:32.162 --> 45:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was just 47 years old.

45:35.132 --> 45:40.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the chief operating officer
of Facebook,
and one of the best known female
executives

45:40.537 --> 45:46.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the business world, Sandberg
had all the
resources and support one could
imagine.

45:46.343 --> 45:51.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But none of that would lessen
the grief that
engulfed her and their two young
children.

45:51.381 --> 45:54.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, Facebook:
In those early
days and weeks, it feels like
you're not going

45:54.952 --> 46:01.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get through a minute, let
alone a day.

46:01.325 --> 46:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My biggest fear was that my kids
would never
be happy again, that their
happiness would

46:05.829 --> 46:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been wiped away in that
same instant
we lost Dave.

46:09.466 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who had been
through loss
and been through real adversity
who told me

46:12.803 --> 46:13.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it gets better.

46:13.804 --> 46:15.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I didn't believe them.

46:15.739 --> 46:21.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ten days later,
when she returned
to work, it was hard to focus on
running a

46:21.145 --> 46:28.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social media giant, with 17,000
employees
and more than a billion daily
users.

46:28.352 --> 46:33.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suddenly, one of the most
successful women
in business was struggling to
hold it together

46:33.490 --> 46:35.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the office.

46:35.359 --> 46:41.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: When Dave first
died, I felt
like I was in a void, like I
couldn't breathe,

46:41.064 --> 46:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or catch my breath.

46:42.566 --> 46:46.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought at first -- I just
thought, I'm
never going to get through this.

46:46.370 --> 46:47.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't contribute.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't even get through a
meeting without
crying.

46:49.173 --> 46:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A month after his
death, she
posted a tribute to Dave on
Facebook.

46:54.044 --> 46:59.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She wrote about mistakes she had
made in the
past when friends lost loved
ones.

46:59.716 --> 47:05.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She included advice from a close
friend about
how to handle a father-son
event.

47:05.522 --> 47:08.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Option A, Dave, wasn't
available.

47:08.325 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the friend said it was
time to grab
onto option B. But he used
stronger language

47:14.364 --> 47:15.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than that.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became Sandberg's mantra, and
it's the
name of her new book.

47:19.069 --> 47:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: There are
things you can
do, steps you can take to help
yourself and

47:22.873 --> 47:25.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your kids recover.

47:25.409 --> 47:29.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I learned that resilience,
it's not something
we have one set amount of.

47:29.513 --> 47:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a muscle, and we build it.

47:32.883 --> 47:38.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if this helps anyone, even
just a little
bit, themselves or a friend,
then I think

47:38.555 --> 47:39.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will have found some meaning
in this.

47:40.023 --> 47:43.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the book also
about helping
you get through it?

47:43.427 --> 47:47.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: The book is
trying to help
other people hear what I
couldn't hear at

47:47.497 --> 47:48.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the beginning.

47:48.498 --> 47:50.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It does get better.

47:50.434 --> 47:51.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will always miss Dave.

47:51.568 --> 47:53.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I miss Dave every day.

47:53.437 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that feeling of not being
able to breathe
has passed.

47:57.908 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can breathe now.

47:59.643 --> 48:04.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, I think of him
and cry, but,
sometimes, I think of him and
smile.

48:04.281 --> 48:07.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my children can think of
their father
and smile.

48:07.684 --> 48:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want other people going
through this
to know it's possible.

48:11.388 --> 48:17.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Option B" is not
just about
Sandberg's personal journey and
loss.

48:17.194 --> 48:21.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It offers ideas and advice for
people who've
experienced their own trauma.

48:21.899 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Co-written with psychologist and
bestselling
author Adam Grant, the book puts
a big emphasis

48:27.771 --> 48:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on what Sandberg calls the
elephant in the
room.

48:30.674 --> 48:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: It's not just
the loss, or
the cancer, or losing a job, or
someone in

48:35.445 --> 48:37.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your family going to jail.

48:37.314 --> 48:39.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the silence that surrounds
that.

48:39.216 --> 48:46.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, when I lost Dave, I had
this overwhelming
grief, but also just this
isolation I had

48:46.089 --> 48:47.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never felt in my life.

48:47.891 --> 48:52.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I had always felt really
connected to my friends,
neighbors and family, people I
work with.

48:52.963 --> 48:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when I came back to work,
people barely
spoke to me.

48:55.799 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They looked at me like I was a
deer in the
headlights.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I know they meant well.

49:00.103 --> 49:03.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were afraid to say the
wrong thing, so
they said nothing at all.

49:03.106 --> 49:07.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's just one
of the ways
that people should be able to
take away from

49:07.077 --> 49:11.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your experience about how to
reach out to
someone who's going through
something like

49:11.848 --> 49:16.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, something traumatic like
this, and for
those who are going through it
themselves,

49:16.186 --> 49:20.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who aren't accustomed maybe to
reaching out,
or who aren't comfortable, for
whatever reason?

49:20.590 --> 49:25.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: If you're
trying to help
someone who's facing adversity,
the first

49:25.896 --> 49:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and most important thing is to
acknowledge
the pain.

49:30.200 --> 49:34.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before, if I had a colleague or
a friend who
had lost someone, who was going
through cancer

49:34.871 --> 49:37.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treatment, I thought bringing it
up to them
was reminding them.

49:37.607 --> 49:39.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I was silent.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Losing Dave taught me how absurd
that was.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't remind me I lost my
husband.

49:43.680 --> 49:46.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know that every minute of
every day.

49:46.516 --> 49:52.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, when people said
nothing, particularly
in the beginning, how are you
felt like, how

49:52.155 --> 49:53.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are -- how am I?

49:53.657 --> 49:55.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just lost my husband.

49:55.559 --> 49:56.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they were asking.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I took that as the standard
American I'm supposed
to -- greeting.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm supposed to say fine and
move on.

50:01.131 --> 50:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they meant it.

50:02.966 --> 50:08.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I learned to say, I'm
not great,
or I'm really sad today, or
thanks for asking,

50:08.872 --> 50:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to talk about it
right now, I
was letting them acknowledge.

50:13.076 --> 50:15.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's really on both sides
to acknowledge.

50:15.512 --> 50:20.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sandberg also
writes about
how important it is not to blame
yourself.

50:20.550 --> 50:26.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: When Dave first
died, I thought
it was my fault.

50:26.156 --> 50:30.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The initial report said he'd
died of head
trauma from falling off an
exercise machine.

50:30.093 --> 50:33.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My brother's a neurosurgeon, and
he told me
that wasn't true.

50:33.130 --> 50:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we got the autopsy, we
realized he had
died of a cardiac arrhythmia.

50:37.267 --> 50:43.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I still blamed myself, and I
blamed myself
for a long time.

50:43.340 --> 50:47.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when Adam told me that,
because I was
blaming myself, I was going to
keep my kids

50:47.878 --> 50:54.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from recovering, because I was
going to keep
myself from recovering, that
really helped.

50:54.284 --> 50:57.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to show ourselves
compassion, the
same compassion we would show a
friend.

50:57.888 --> 51:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sandberg said
that, ultimately,
family, friends and co-workers,
including

51:03.460 --> 51:07.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her boss, Mark Zuckerberg, made
a huge difference.

51:07.330 --> 51:12.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not everybody may go back to a
supportive
environment, making it even
harder for them.

51:12.769 --> 51:18.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what do you say to people
who are thinking,
how am I going to face
co-workers, what if

51:18.241 --> 51:22.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my employer doesn't give me the
time or the
space or the understanding that
I need?

51:22.846 --> 51:29.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: Yes, we have so
much to do
to make it easier for people at
work.

51:29.119 --> 51:30.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm really lucky.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Facebook has great policies.

51:31.521 --> 51:35.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We offer a lot of bereavement
leave, a lot
of leave of all kinds.

51:35.058 --> 51:37.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have done even more since
Dave died
for people.

51:37.727 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need our workplaces and
then our public
policy to give people the paid,
paid time

51:43.266 --> 51:46.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off they need, because, for a
lot of people,
if the time is unpaid, they
can't take it.

51:46.970 --> 51:52.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sandberg has
become increasingly
outspoken about the workplace,
family life

51:52.109 --> 51:53.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and women's equality.

51:53.810 --> 51:59.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her 2012 book, "Lean In," served
as a call
to many women to become more
assertive.

51:59.783 --> 52:05.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to some, Sandberg's tone
smacked of wealthy
white privilege.

52:05.388 --> 52:11.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was criticized in some
quarters for failing
to appreciate what single
parents and non-traditional

52:11.862 --> 52:13.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
families go through.

52:13.763 --> 52:18.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now she's expanded the message
to stress the
role of government and society
in the lives

52:18.768 --> 52:20.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of women.

52:20.537 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: We are the only
developed
country in the world, the only
one, without

52:23.573 --> 52:25.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
paid maternity leave.

52:25.742 --> 52:28.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need that, and paid
paternity leave,
so men and women are equal.

52:28.678 --> 52:32.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're one of the only developed
countries
without paid family leave.

52:32.682 --> 52:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot about going
through everything
I went through, and also
worrying about paying

52:37.287 --> 52:43.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a basic health care bill, about
single mothers
who wake up every day in this
country and

52:43.326 --> 52:47.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worry about whether they can
take care of
a sick child, or lose their job
that they

52:47.898 --> 52:50.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need, about the minimum wage we
have.

52:50.867 --> 52:54.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two-thirds of minimum wage
workers are women.

52:54.404 --> 52:56.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Minimum wage hasn't been raised
at the federal
level in forever.

52:56.973 --> 52:58.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's unacceptable.

52:58.475 --> 53:03.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Unexpectedly, joy
is also an
essential message in the book.

53:03.580 --> 53:06.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something Sandberg feared
she would never
feel again.

53:06.883 --> 53:10.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYL SANDBERG: I thought it
would always
feel that way.

53:10.253 --> 53:14.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the sadness is still here,
but it doesn't
feel like I'm trapped in a void
anymore.

53:14.958 --> 53:19.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have joy, and I have
laughter, and I
have moments with my kids where
we remember

53:19.462 --> 53:24.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their daddy with real joy, and
we look at
pictures and videos.

53:24.467 --> 53:29.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want anyone going through
hardship to
know that it does get better.

53:29.072 --> 53:31.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all have things we can
appreciate.

53:31.575 --> 53:34.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all have moments that we can
notice the
joy.

53:34.844 --> 53:37.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all can find gratitude for
being alive.

53:37.681 --> 53:42.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that doesn't mean that every
story has
a happy ending, because it
doesn't.

53:42.085 --> 53:49.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are things we can do
to build resilience
in ourselves and each other that
make us stronger.

53:50.026 --> 53:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sheryl Sandberg
has not only
written this book, "Option B,"
about her experience.

53:55.999 --> 54:00.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's encouraging people going
through tragedy
to form support groups to be
there for each

54:00.937 --> 54:02.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

54:02.372 --> 54:03.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:04.007 --> 54:05.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:05.175 --> 54:07.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:07.344 --> 54:16.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
