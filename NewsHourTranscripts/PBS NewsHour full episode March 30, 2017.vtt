JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.640 --> 00:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: In
their first
public hearing, senators slam
Russia for interfering

00:11.945 --> 00:16.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the election, as the ranking
Democrat on
the House Intelligence Committee
says White

00:16.950 --> 00:19.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House actions raise profound
questions.

00:19.786 --> 00:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: North Carolina lawmakers
reach a compromise
to repeal the controversial bill
on transgender

00:26.727 --> 00:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bathroom use, but LGBT
supporters denounce
the deal.

00:32.399 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And teaching kids the value of a
dollar -- why
parents should try giving money
lessons early

00:38.538 --> 00:40.274 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

00:40.307 --> 00:44.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER, Personal Finance
Expert: By
age 3, children can understand
basic money

00:44.311 --> 00:51.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concepts like exchange, or we
have to make
choices, or things have a value.
And those

00:51.151 --> 00:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversations are important to
start when
kids are really little.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.892 --> 01:03.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.363 --> 01:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia's election
season meddling
dominated the conversation on
both ends of

01:16.410 --> 01:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pennsylvania Avenue today.

01:18.378 --> 01:23.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Capitol Hill, the Senate
Intelligence Committee
held its first public hearing on
the issue.

01:23.450 --> 01:28.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the White House says
it's invited
the heads of both congressional
Intelligence

01:28.188 --> 01:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
panels to view new material from
the National
Security Council. That came
after The New

01:33.660 --> 01:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times reported that two
White House officials
helped to provide House
Intelligence Chair

01:39.599 --> 01:42.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Devin Nunes view surveillance
reports.

01:42.803 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That committee's top Democrat,
Adam Schiff
of California, says the
situation raises profound

01:48.575 --> 01:50.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
concerns.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D),
California: We look
at these kind of issues all the
time. This

01:52.179 --> 01:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not new for our committee,
which is why
it makes so unusual, irregular
that it would

01:58.251 --> 02:00.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be presented to us in this way.

02:00.654 --> 02:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is within our ordinary
wheelhouse. There
is a proper way to put this
before the committee.

02:06.193 --> 02:10.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That certainly was not followed
here. And
the White House ought to explain
why that

02:10.597 --> 02:12.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wasn't followed here.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will hear more
from the
Senate Intelligence Committee
hearing later

02:15.402 --> 02:17.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

02:17.204 --> 02:22.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Trump took
public aim at some conservative
Republicans

02:22.309 --> 02:25.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who helped sink the GOP's
Obamacare replacement.

02:25.812 --> 02:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tweeted that -- quote -- "The
Freedom Caucus
will hurt the entire Republican
agenda if

02:31.551 --> 02:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't get on the team. We
must fight
them."

02:34.221 --> 02:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, one of the members of
that caucus,
Michigan Representative Justin
Amash said:

02:39.860 --> 02:42.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Most people don't take well to
being bullied."

02:42.929 --> 02:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For his part, House Speaker Paul
Ryan said
he empathizes with the
president.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I understand the president's
frustration.

02:50.570 --> 02:56.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I share frustration. About 90
percent of our
conference is for this bill to
repeal and

02:56.543 --> 03:01.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
replace Obamacare, and about 10
percent are
not. And that's not enough to
pass a bill.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're close.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm encouraging our members
to do is
to keep talking with each other
until we get

03:05.652 --> 03:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the consensus to pass this bill.

03:07.421 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
later called
out three representatives by
name. In another

03:12.692 --> 03:18.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tweet, he called on Mark Meadows
of North
Carolina, Ohio's Jim Jordan, and
Idaho's Raul

03:18.498 --> 03:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Labrador to -- quote -- "get on
board."

03:20.734 --> 03:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Kansas Governor Sam
Brownback today
vetoed a bill that would've
expanded Medicaid

03:26.807 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his state. He said it would
burden Kansas
with what he called
unrestrainable entitlement

03:32.345 --> 03:34.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
costs.

03:34.181 --> 03:38.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in Hawaii has
extended his
order blocking President Trump's
revised travel

03:38.852 --> 03:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ban. The Department of Justice
says it's considering
its next steps.

03:43.090 --> 03:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump White House also today
announced
the departure of a top aide.
Deputy Chief

03:48.095 --> 03:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Staff Katie Walsh was a close
ally of the
chief of staff, Reince Priebus.
Officials

03:54.101 --> 03:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said this does not signal that
more departures
are around the corner.

03:58.839 --> 04:04.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress narrowly passed a bill
today that
allows states to cut funds to
Planned Parenthood

04:04.144 --> 04:09.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other abortion providers.
Vice President
Pence was called on to cast the
tie-breaking

04:09.082 --> 04:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote in the Senate after two
Republican women
senators broke with their party
and voted

04:15.122 --> 04:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no, Maine's Susan Collins and
Alaska's Lisa
Murkowski.

04:20.427 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and Turkey struggled
today over the
role of Kurdish forces in
fighting the Islamic

04:25.465 --> 04:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State group. Turkey wants the
U.S. to partner
with its military, but the
Pentagon has backed

04:31.438 --> 04:33.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syrian Kurdish troops.

04:33.540 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
was in Ankara
today, and said the countries
see eye-to-eye

04:38.612 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on fighting ISIS, also known as
Da'esh.

04:41.414 --> 04:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: There
is no space between Turkey and
the United

04:45.952 --> 04:50.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States in our commitment to
defeat Da'esh.
These are not easy decisions.
There are difficult

04:51.024 --> 04:53.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
choices that have to be made.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this has been very good. The
conversations
today were very frank, very
candid.

04:57.564 --> 05:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tillerson is set
to attend
a meeting of NATO foreign
ministers in Brussels

05:02.369 --> 05:04.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

05:04.237 --> 05:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has given the
military more
authority to go after al-Qaida
linked militants

05:08.508 --> 05:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Somalia. The move means that
the Pentagon
can conduct more aggressive
airstrikes. It

05:13.847 --> 05:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also allows U.S. special forces
to accompany
the Somalian army.

05:19.619 --> 05:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel's Security Cabinet has
approved that
country's first new housing
settlements in

05:24.491 --> 05:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Palestinian territory in two
decades.
The White House has expressed
concerns about

05:29.596 --> 05:34.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
settlement activity. But after
today's announcement,
the White House said that Israel
has made

05:34.334 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it clear that it will adopt a
policy that
takes President Trump's concerns
-- quote

05:39.005 --> 05:41.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- "into consideration."

05:41.208 --> 05:46.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In South Korea, ousted President
Park Geun-hye
has been arrested on corruption
charges. She

05:46.947 --> 05:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faces allegations of colluding
with a friend
to extort money from businesses.
Park was

05:52.786 --> 05:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioned for nearly nine hours
before a
court in Seoul granted her
arrest warrant.

05:59.159 --> 06:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They cited concerns that she may
try to destroy
evidence.

06:03.530 --> 06:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks moved higher on Wall
Street today,
led by gains in the banking
sector. The Dow

06:08.168 --> 06:15.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
69 points
to close at 20728. The Nasdaq
posted a record

06:15.575 --> 06:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close, rising more than 16, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nearly seven.

06:20.347 --> 06:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Senate
sets its sights on Russian
election meddling;

06:25.919 --> 06:32.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North Carolina repeals a
controversial law
on transgender bathroom use;
veteran lawmakers

06:32.659 --> 06:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
analyze how President Trump is
shaping the
U.S. role in the world; and much
more.

06:46.506 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to the U.S. Senate,
where the focus
today centered on Russia, from
the very real

06:53.280 --> 06:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threats of fake news stories to
rules for
engagement in a cyber-war.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), Florida:
Aren't we in
the midst of a blitzkrieg, for a
lack of a

07:00.920 --> 07:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better term, of informational
warfare conducted
by Russian trolls under the
command of Vladimir

07:06.526 --> 07:08.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin?

07:08.461 --> 07:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a rare
public hearing
into Russia's meddling in last
year's presidential

07:11.464 --> 07:17.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
election. Both Senate
Intelligence Committee
leaders, Republican Richard Burr
and Democrat

07:17.604 --> 07:23.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Warner, made clear that
they wanted to
avoid the partisanship that's
plagued their

07:23.243 --> 07:25.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House counterparts'
investigation.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RICHARD BURR (R), North
Carolina: We
must engage in a
whole-of-government approach

07:28.548 --> 07:30.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to combat Russian active
measures.

07:30.183 --> 07:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
We simply
must, and we will, get this
right.

07:34.220 --> 07:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The experts
testifying before
the panel warned that anyone is
now vulnerable

07:39.526 --> 07:41.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Russian interference.

07:41.761 --> 07:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clint Watts is a former FBI
agent now with
the Foreign Policy Research
Institute.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINT WATTS, Foreign Policy
Research Institute:
Well, it's used right now
against people of

07:49.336 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both sides. So, we will watch
them play both
sides. They might go after a
Republican person

07:55.975 --> 07:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this room tomorrow, and then
they will
switch.

07:58.345 --> 08:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Watts spotlighted
how experts
say the Kremlin pushes fake news
and disinformation

08:04.284 --> 08:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to influence American opinions.

08:06.152 --> 08:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: They launch those
simultaneously
as they begin the engagement or
push of false

08:10.824 --> 08:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news stories, usually from R.T.
and Sputnik
News. They do that in
unison,which games the

08:16.296 --> 08:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social media system, such that
such a high
volume of content being pushed
at the same

08:21.501 --> 08:26.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time raises that into the trends
that you
will see if you looked at
Facebook or Twitter

08:26.239 --> 08:28.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whatever it might be.

08:28.041 --> 08:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The former FBI
agent said a
part of the proliferation of
fake news was

08:32.312 --> 08:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because of what President Trump
says on Twitter.

08:34.848 --> 08:38.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. JAMES LANKFORD (R),
Oklahoma: There is
much more engaging this time in
our election.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why now?

08:40.320 --> 08:43.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: He claimed that the
election
could be rigged. That was the
number one theme

08:43.156 --> 08:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pushed by R.T., Sputnik news,
white outlets
all the way up until the
election.

08:47.227 --> 08:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the reason active
measure works -- and
it does today in terms of Trump
Tower being

08:52.232 --> 08:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wiretapped -- is because they
parrot the same
line. But until we get a firm
basis on fact

08:57.604 --> 09:03.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and fiction in our own country,
get some agreement
about the facts, whether it be
do I support

09:03.243 --> 09:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the intelligence community or a
story I read
on my Twitter feed, we're going
to have a

09:07.313 --> 09:09.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big problem.

09:09.182 --> 09:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former National
Security Agency
Director Keith Alexander said
these intrusions

09:13.720 --> 09:19.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not just to influence
America's political
system, but to further Russian
interests abroad.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEITH ALEXANDER, Former
Director, National
Security Agency: This is
widespread in a campaign

09:22.395 --> 09:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are looking at doing
that will drive
wedges between our own political
parties and

09:28.668 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between our country and NATO,
and within NATO
and within the European Union.

09:32.705 --> 09:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Watts said,
because the U.S.
response has been so slow,
Russians have no

09:38.111 --> 09:39.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reason to limit their
intrusions.

09:39.979 --> 09:44.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CLINT WATTS: We have no
organized response
to a country or even a policy
towards Russia

09:44.150 --> 09:50.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now. So, I think, until we
set the boundaries
about how we are going to either
push/pull

09:50.957 --> 09:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with them, they are going to
move as far as
they can pushing.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Watts offered
his own recommendations
on how the U.S. can solve that
problem.

09:58.731 --> 10:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINT WATTS: We need a State
Department and
a DHS web site that immediately
refute when

10:03.603 --> 10:07.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
falsehoods are put out.
Mainstream media companies,
we need to be working with them.
What if they

10:07.941 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
boycotted WikiLeaks
collectively? What if
they all didn't race to publish
too quickly?

10:14.447 --> 10:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If those damaging, stolen
information that
is misconstrued oftentimes
doesn't get into

10:20.153 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mainstream media, if all of
them block
it out, Russia's influence dies
on the vine.

10:25.325 --> 10:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate
Intelligence Committee
is expected to hold more
Sessions on Russia's

10:30.930 --> 10:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
influence in the coming weeks.

10:33.733 --> 10:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're joined now by a member of
the Senate
Select Committee on
Intelligence. He is Ron

10:38.137 --> 10:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Wyden, welcome back to
the program.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to ask you about that
hearing, but
first a quick question about
what is going

10:44.711 --> 10:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, on the House side. And that
is the disclosure
today that it was White House
aides who provided

10:51.351 --> 10:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the House Intelligence Committee
chairman
or helped provide him with
surveillance reports

10:57.457 --> 11:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Trump campaign, Trump
transition.

11:02.228 --> 11:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And how do you see this
affecting the ability
of this investigation to go
forward?

11:07.333 --> 11:12.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN (D), Oregon:
Judy, I would
just say the new news in the
House of Representatives

11:12.572 --> 11:14.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is really bizarre.

11:14.874 --> 11:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to me the chairman
over there,
Mr. Nunes, really doesn't have
an ounce of

11:20.213 --> 11:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
credibility left. From all that
we have been
able to gather, he has sort of
conveyed this

11:27.120 --> 11:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impression that this information
he got was
from something like a
whistle-blower, a real

11:34.227 --> 11:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independent intelligence source.
Now it really
looks like just plain old White
House spin.

11:40.033 --> 11:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we also
learned today that
it was individuals close to the
president,

11:45.705 --> 11:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Bannon, the president's
son-in-law,
Jared Kushner, who were backing
up these efforts,

11:52.579 --> 11:54.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
apparently, by the National
Security Council.

11:54.614 --> 12:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN: I have heard
those press reports.
I can't -- can't confirm them.

12:00.486 --> 12:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact is, Judy, in the
Senate, we had
a really pretty significant
hearing. You talked

12:06.292 --> 12:12.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about some of the
cyber-questions. I have
been concerned that the key to a
successful

12:12.231 --> 12:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation in both the House
and the Senate
is to follow the money.

12:17.537 --> 12:22.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, what we heard is, that
made sense,
but you also ought to follow the
trail of

12:23.009 --> 12:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead bodies. For example, there
was a very
mysterious death that the press
was reporting

12:29.382 --> 12:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, a KGB officer who was
associated with
the famous dossier. So, there
are a lot of

12:33.987 --> 12:35.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issues to dig into.

12:35.722 --> 12:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, do you
believe after this
hearing today on the Senate side
that you

12:39.325 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are closer to understanding the
magnitude
of Russia's interference in the
election?

12:44.063 --> 12:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN: I think we have
to accelerate
the pace.

12:46.833 --> 12:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have conveyed that to both the
chairman
and the vice chairman. Look,
there is a way

12:53.206 --> 13:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be both professional and
convey a sense
of urgency. The two are not
mutually exclusive.

13:00.546 --> 13:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the way the story is coming
out, it's
coming out through leaks, it's
coming out

13:04.350 --> 13:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through press reports, it's
coming out with
just false tweets by the
president of the

13:08.888 --> 13:10.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

13:10.657 --> 13:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American people are worried.
I think we
need to get the facts out, and I
think a lot

13:14.127 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more needs to be done in an open
hearing.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You referred,
Senator, to your
own push,.

13:19.098 --> 13:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wrote a letter to the
chairman and the
ranking member of the Senate
Intelligence

13:23.269 --> 13:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, urging them to look
into, as you
said, the financial
relationships between

13:27.373 --> 13:30.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump and any Russian
officials.

13:30.109 --> 13:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are they following up on that
advice, and
could that lead to obtaining or
trying to

13:35.615 --> 13:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obtain the president's tax
returns?

13:36.949 --> 13:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN: Not yet, Judy.

13:38.751 --> 13:44.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I only sent them the letter
yesterday.
Look, the tax returns are a key
part of this.

13:44.824 --> 13:50.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm the author of the
legislation Presidential
Tax Transparency Act, with 20
United States

13:50.163 --> 13:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senators, to require those
returns be made
public, because the returns are
really the

13:54.634 --> 13:57.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lowest ethical bar for a
president.

13:57.036 --> 14:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a lot more to this.
We need to
make sure, both in the United
States and in

14:03.142 --> 14:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, that we follow this
whole web of financial
transactions that can involve
the president,

14:09.015 --> 14:12.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it can involve his associates,
it can involve
his family. But we have got to
get to the

14:12.685 --> 14:14.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bottom of this.

14:14.554 --> 14:18.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the ultimate
goal here to
determine whether there was
collusion between

14:18.491 --> 14:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump campaign and Russian
officials?

14:20.493 --> 14:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN: That's right at
the heart
of the agenda. And we could have
learned about

14:26.032 --> 14:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, at least some information,
quite a bit
earlier.

14:29.736 --> 14:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When James Comey came to the
Intelligence
Committee for another open
hearing in January,

14:34.407 --> 14:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked him whether he was
following up on
connections between the
president and the

14:40.246 --> 14:44.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russians. And he said he
wouldn't answer.
We just learned about that
recently.

14:44.083 --> 14:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the American people deserve
more information.
They deserve it in my more
timely way. And

14:49.188 --> 14:52.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that can be done without
compromising our
security interests.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Senator, are
you confident that that -- that
every effort

14:55.528 --> 15:02.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is being made both by
congressional committees
and by the investigations under
way at the

15:02.201 --> 15:03.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FBI and other government
agencies?

15:04.003 --> 15:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN: I can tell you
that it has
been very hard to excavate the
information

15:09.175 --> 15:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we need from the government
agencies.

15:12.178 --> 15:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think both Senator Warner and
Chairman Burr
would agree on it. One of the
things that

15:17.450 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to help is going to be
to have more
people, more staff people on
that case. And

15:22.021 --> 15:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will have some more to say
about that down
the road.

15:23.990 --> 15:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Ron
Wyden, a member
of the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence,

15:30.129 --> 15:33.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

15:33.699 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. RON WYDEN: Thank you.

15:39.639 --> 15:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, compromise
came to North
Carolina, on the heels of a
long-running political

15:47.046 --> 15:48.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
controversy.

15:49.015 --> 15:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state suffered a business
and economic
backlash from a law that many
saw as discriminatory.

15:53.820 --> 15:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina had lost out on
music concerts,
conventions and sporting events,
and was facing

15:59.292 --> 16:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deadline of sorts from the
NCAA.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan reports.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: House Bill 142 is adopted.

16:05.832 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: With that,
North Carolina's
state legislature overwhelmingly
voted to

16:10.069 --> 16:15.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
replace its so-called bathroom
bill. The new
bill was brokered by the state's
Democratic

16:15.341 --> 16:17.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Governor Roy Cooper and
Republican lawmakers.

16:17.877 --> 16:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROY COOPER (D), North
Carolina: Today,
we repeal House Bill 2 and we
begin to end

16:25.218 --> 16:27.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
discrimination in North
Carolina.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ahead of the
vote, members
be both sides said they were
ready to move

16:31.891 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT STONE (R), North Carolina
State Representative:
The time has come for us to get
out from under

16:36.095 --> 16:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the national spotlight for
negative things.

16:40.199 --> 16:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still, critics
both inside
and outside the chamber and said
the measure

16:43.402 --> 16:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no compromise at all. The new
bill repeals
last year's law, which, among
other things,

16:49.775 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
required transgender people use
public bathrooms
according to their gender at
birth. But it

16:54.714 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaves the Republican-dominated
state legislature
in charge of setting future
policy on bathroom

17:01.287 --> 17:03.122 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
use.

17:03.155 --> 17:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it continues to bar local
municipalities
from passing their own
nondiscrimination laws

17:06.726 --> 17:08.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the issue until 2020.

17:08.527 --> 17:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ROY COOPER: I wish it were
sooner than
2020. I really do. But while
these additional

17:18.971 --> 17:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protections may be temporarily
delayed, they
will not be forever denied.

17:25.278 --> 17:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But several
Democrats and
LGBT advocates said those
provisions mean

17:30.783 --> 17:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new legislation is simply a
repeal in
name only.

17:34.086 --> 17:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It kicks HB-2 down the road
to 2020,
keeping most of the awful law on
the books

17:39.659 --> 17:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for someone else to deal with.
This is not
about returning us to the status
quo. This

17:44.330 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't about repealing HB-2. It
does neither
of those things.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Instead, they
argue, it's
designed to appease
organizations who boycotted

17:52.038 --> 17:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina, and not members
of the LGBT
community. Today's vote comes
after the NCAA

17:59.478 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threatened to pull future
college sports tournaments
from the state through the year
2022 if it

18:05.751 --> 18:07.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't change the law.

18:07.586 --> 18:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NCAA already had moved
championship games
to other states that were to be
played in

18:12.591 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina this year.
Indeed, members
from both parties, including the
House's Democratic

18:18.831 --> 18:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader, said the economic
implications can't
be ignored.

18:22.468 --> 18:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, others on the Republican
side decried
the new bill, and said the NCAA
was wielding

18:27.707 --> 18:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its influence inappropriately.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY BOSWELL (R), North
Carolina State
Representative: I refuse to bow
to the NCAA's

18:32.244 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dictates and demands. Thank you,
sir.

18:34.380 --> 18:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It remains to
be seen whether
the new bill will prompt
businesses and organizations

18:38.918 --> 18:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to end their boycott of the
state.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We get two takes now on today's
deal.

18:44.724 --> 18:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, Darren Jackson is the
House minority
leader for the Democrats in
North Carolina.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He spoke in favor of it.

18:50.997 --> 18:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked with him a short time
ago and began
by asking why it was important
to ask today,

18:55.267 --> 18:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even if the bill wasn't perfect.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARREN JACKSON (D), North
Carolina State Representative:
Well, the number one reason is
to get rid

18:59.338 --> 19:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of House Bill 2 and the stain
that it has
put on North Carolina as a
state, the economic

19:06.112 --> 19:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harm that it has done to the
state. We just
needed to move past that part of
it and start

19:11.050 --> 19:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
making some steps forward.

19:12.618 --> 19:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was important to do that
now, before
more harm comes to the state.

19:17.623 --> 19:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You also noted
that the
NCAA, the ACC, the NBA, other
sporting events

19:23.863 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might come back, and the ripple
effects it
has on all the service workers
that work at

19:27.500 --> 19:29.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these facilities.

19:29.301 --> 19:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of critics even in the
legislature say
that you all are bending too
much to the will

19:33.906 --> 19:37.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the NCAA, even heard one
assemblyman say
that perhaps you should replace
the flags

19:37.643 --> 19:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside with the NCAA flag and a
white flag.

19:40.112 --> 19:44.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DARREN JACKSON: I'm not
repealing House Bill
2 because of pressure. We have
used the pressure

19:44.650 --> 19:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has been brought to bear by
other organizations
and businesses to help us in our
calls to

19:50.322 --> 19:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeal House Bill 2. So, I view
their pressure
as being helpful in the
situation.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it a
coincidence then
that it is happening on the day
where the

19:58.464 --> 20:02.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NCAA -- after we record this
interview, about
an hour or so after, they are
going to have

20:02.768 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a press conference and they're
going to be
deciding whether or not the NCAA
comes back

20:06.238 --> 20:07.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to North Carolina over the next
few years?

20:07.807 --> 20:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARREN JACKSON: Well, no, I
don't think it's
a coincidence at all.

20:11.577 --> 20:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that they are making
these decisions
is what has driven the
Republicans finally

20:16.048 --> 20:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the negotiating table, so
that we could
at least discuss this and try to
work out

20:20.519 --> 20:22.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a compromise.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: LGBT groups,
even some of
your own members on the floor
today said that

20:25.624 --> 20:31.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this doesn't go far enough, that
it doesn't
offer statewide protection for
the LGBT community,

20:31.197 --> 20:35.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, in fact, it even goes the
other way,
that it freezes local
jurisdictions from setting

20:35.234 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up their greater protections
until 2020.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So isn't justice deferred
justice denied?

20:41.006 --> 20:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARREN JACKSON: No, I mean,
those ordinances
were already frozen by House
Bill 2 permanently.

20:48.180 --> 20:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This provides a way forward
starting in 2020,
but also gives some relief
immediately to

20:53.452 --> 20:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
municipalities who want to do
these types
of protections in their
contracting with private

20:58.824 --> 21:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
businesses that want to do
business in their
cities. So, this will allow the
cities to

21:04.029 --> 21:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make a big step forward now, but
even bigger
step forward come 2020.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, you know, that
puts a lot
of pressure on the Democrats in
the General

21:12.037 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Assembly to pick up seats in the
2018 election
and maybe move this process
forward, because

21:17.376 --> 21:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what North Carolina really needs
is statewide
protections.

21:20.045 --> 21:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The governor
also said that
this is not the last step; it is
the first

21:24.150 --> 21:25.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
step.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what is next? What else can
you do to
try to ensure that this
community is protected?

21:29.955 --> 21:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARREN JACKSON: Well, like I was
talking about
elections, we need to win more
seats. We are

21:35.961 --> 21:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a superminority. So, I can
file any bill
I want to file, but it's not
going to get

21:40.699 --> 21:42.468 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heard.

21:42.501 --> 21:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we need to take back a
chamber of the
General Assembly, and then we
can introduce

21:45.237 --> 21:49.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bills to push statewide
protections. But the
conversation has been started.
There is no

21:49.942 --> 21:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting that genie back in the
bottle. I mean,
businesses may return to North
Carolina, but

21:54.446 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're going to keep the
pressure up for
North Carolina to continue to
make steps forward

21:59.718 --> 22:04.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and allow people to be free from
the discrimination
in employment and public
accommodations.

22:04.790 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we support that and we will
be fighting
with them right along. We just
thought it

22:08.694 --> 22:13.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was important to take a
compromise that we
could get it now to get rid of
House Bill

22:13.199 --> 22:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2, so we could take that step
forward. Even
if it is a small step forward,
and not as

22:17.803 --> 22:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big a step as many people would
have liked
to take, we have gotten rid of
House Bill

22:21.840 --> 22:23.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
2. And that is the most
important thing.

22:23.642 --> 22:27.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Darren
Jackson, Democratic
Assembly minority leader in
North Carolina,

22:27.413 --> 22:28.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DARREN JACKSON: Thank you.

22:30.216 --> 22:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Multiple civil
right groups,
especially in the LGBTQ
community, blasted

22:33.485 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this compromise.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cathryn Oakley is the senior
legislative counsel
with the Human Rights Campaign.

22:38.891 --> 22:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with her from Raleigh.
And I asked
what she found wrong with the
deal.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHRYN OAKLEY, Human Rights
Campaign: Unfortunately,
the legislation that passed
today was the

22:45.598 --> 22:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
result of a backroom deal that
was done without
the consultation of the LGBTQ
community or

22:52.938 --> 22:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other civil rights communities.

22:55.174 --> 23:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was put together by the
governor
and Republican leadership. And
they call it

23:01.547 --> 23:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a compromise. They call it a
repeal. But,
unfortunately, what it is, is
simply doubling

23:06.752 --> 23:12.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
down on the kind of
discrimination that brought
HB-2 to North Carolina in the
first place.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it better
that what was
on the books?

23:14.293 --> 23:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHRYN OAKLEY: Well, HB-2 is
the most egregious
anti-LGBT law that has been
passed into law

23:22.167 --> 23:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in any state in the country. It
was an incredibly
egregious law that was very
harmful.

23:27.673 --> 23:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, what really we
needed to have
happen today, with all of the
pressure that

23:32.811 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came from today's impending NCAA
deadline,
where the NCAA is going to
announce where

23:39.285 --> 23:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are going to be awarding
games through
2022, what needed to be done
with that pressure

23:43.989 --> 23:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was a full repeal of HB-2.

23:47.459 --> 23:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is what the LGBTQ community
needs and
has been demanding for more than
a year now.

23:52.698 --> 23:59.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead, what we got was
something that
continues to discriminate
against LGBTQ people

23:59.738 --> 24:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and continues to box LGBTQ
people out of getting
meaningful nondiscrimination
protections.

24:04.843 --> 24:09.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, there are will
essentially be no
nondiscrimination protections at
all for at

24:09.315 --> 24:15.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least four years. And even then,
what will
be allowed will be very limited
and devoid

24:15.387 --> 24:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of meaning for particularly
transgender people.

24:17.723 --> 24:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is very problematic that,
instead of
working with all of the pressure
that was

24:25.230 --> 24:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generated, working with the LGBT
community,
that, instead, the governor and
leadership

24:30.636 --> 24:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chose to go down this path that
continues
to perpetuate discrimination.

24:35.040 --> 24:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The governor
said today
-- he sort of laid out the
political reality

24:39.278 --> 24:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the landscape and said that
this is a legislature
that is a supermajority, not in
his party.

24:44.983 --> 24:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I heard, and as you
probably did in
several floor speeches, there
are lots of

24:49.855 --> 24:54.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of the legislature who
hear from constituents,
an overwhelming majority, who
don't even want

24:55.027 --> 24:56.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HB-2 repealed.

24:56.762 --> 25:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what do you do in that
context? Was this
the possible vs. the goal or the
ideal?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CATHRYN OAKLEY: Yes.

25:03.569 --> 25:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you are absolutely right
that there
is a Republican supermajority.
And that is

25:06.071 --> 25:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how HB-2 came about in the first
place, was
that the Republicans decided
this was a thing

25:10.376 --> 25:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they were doing, and they
did it.

25:13.278 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the truth is, in terms of
political reality,
as you say, there are folks in
the Republican

25:18.884 --> 25:24.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Caucus who didn't want to repeal
HB-2. And
so despite the fact that they
had a supermajority,

25:24.656 --> 25:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these folks were advocating for
HB-2 to stay
on the books because they
thought it was a

25:28.727 --> 25:30.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good law.

25:30.562 --> 25:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What that meant was, in order to
pass anything,
they needed to get Democratic
support. And

25:35.434 --> 25:40.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we really needed to have
happen was for
the governor, who is someone who
the LGBTQ

25:40.572 --> 25:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community worked very hard to
get elected,
someone who many people put
their hope in

25:46.512 --> 25:53.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as being someone who would help
repeal HB-2
and help protect the LGBTQ
community, that

25:53.252 --> 25:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of standing up for full
appeal and
saying that the only thing that
Democrats

25:57.623 --> 26:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will stand for is a full repeal,
is the end
of this incredibly
discriminatory and unprecedented

26:04.496 --> 26:09.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, instead of saying that is
the only thing
Democrats would support, he
continued to negotiate.

26:09.668 --> 26:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, what we
wound up with
was something that, as I say,
unfortunately

26:14.740 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continues to perpetuate the
discrimination
that HB-2 brought to North
Carolina in the

26:18.410 --> 26:20.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place.

26:20.112 --> 26:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Cathryn Oakley
of Human Rights Campaign, thanks
so much.

26:25.250 --> 26:30.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CATHRYN OAKLEY: It's my
pleasure.

26:30.689 --> 26:36.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: part two of
our series
War on the Brain.

26:36.562 --> 26:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, special correspondent
Soledad O'Brien
reports from North Carolina on
the difficulty

26:42.034 --> 26:46.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in diagnosing PTSD and how that
complicates
treatment.

26:46.171 --> 26:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL RODRIGUEZ
(RET.), U.S.
Army: Sometimes, it's fear.
Sometimes, I'm

26:51.877 --> 27:01.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scared of -- of everything.
Sometimes, I feel
sad. Sometimes, I feel
overwhelmed. The biggest

27:01.920 --> 27:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trigger I have is myself.

27:03.655 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't like the way I smell. I
frequently
bathe, at least four or five
times a day.

27:11.463 --> 27:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: After years of
denial, Michael
Rodriguez has finally found ways
to deal with

27:17.369 --> 27:22.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the symptoms of his
post-traumatic stress
disorder. He's a retired special
forces Green

27:22.708 --> 27:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beret. He forges steel to help
him manage
the often gruesome memories that
flood his

27:28.247 --> 27:30.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thoughts.

27:30.048 --> 27:33.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: It's so
physical, it requires a lot of
force and heat

27:33.085 --> 27:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and intensity. I'm facing and
processing a
lot of the stuff that I
remember. The pain

27:39.591 --> 27:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
goes away. I'm forging myself.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Why does that
make you emotional?

27:45.531 --> 27:51.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: Because
I get passionate about it,
because it means

27:51.937 --> 27:54.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot to me.

27:54.339 --> 28:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: For four years,
Michael misled
doctors about his PTSD, fearing
he would lose

28:01.680 --> 28:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his job. He minimized his
symptoms for this
PTSD checklist used to diagnose
all veterans,

28:09.021 --> 28:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like question one: Are you
bothered by repeated,
disturbing and unwanted
memories?

28:14.326 --> 28:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Question four: Were you bothered
by feeling
very upset when something
reminded you of

28:19.665 --> 28:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the stressful experience? There
is no concrete
diagnostic test that would have
forced him

28:25.938 --> 28:27.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get treatment.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: If there
was an actual test, like a hard
copy test,

28:29.708 --> 28:30.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as opposed to...

28:30.742 --> 28:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So, like
something tangible.

28:32.578 --> 28:33.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, because
when you have that, you will
remove the human

28:33.345 --> 28:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
element out of the diagnoses.

28:35.180 --> 28:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Undiagnosed,
but the damage
was done. In 21 years of service
in the Army,

28:41.353 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael was deployed nine times,
from Operation
Restore Hope in Somalia to
Operation Enduring

28:47.559 --> 28:49.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Freedom in Afghanistan.

28:49.394 --> 28:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During that lifetime of service,
he was rattled
by frequent small explosions,
and, Michael

28:55.934 --> 28:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guesses, at least a dozen very
severe blasts.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: They were
significant enough to where I
had my bell

29:01.440 --> 29:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rung. I could feel it through my
whole body,
felt numb, some memory issues,
dizziness definitely,

29:08.146 --> 29:10.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vomiting.

29:10.048 --> 29:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: In 2006,
driving in a convoy
on patrol in Afghanistan, the
vehicle in front

29:14.686 --> 29:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of him was hit by an IED.

29:16.521 --> 29:20.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: It threw
the ATV I was on, four-wheeler,
kind of pushed

29:20.959 --> 29:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through it, and threw me. I
couldn't see out
of my left eye. I had really the
worst headache

29:25.831 --> 29:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have ever had in my life.

29:27.833 --> 29:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The blast gave
Michael permanent
double vision. Today, he wears a
tinted prosthetic

29:32.604 --> 29:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lens in his left eye to correct
it. He also
suffered massive daily
headaches, slurred

29:38.110 --> 29:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speech and balance problems. He
was left with
emotional scars as well.

29:42.581 --> 29:47.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: The wheels
were just coming off my wagon. I
was falling

29:47.753 --> 29:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apart. Anger issues. I was
drinking a lot.
I was trying to hide it. I would
-- I was

29:50.956 --> 29:52.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very moody.

29:52.858 --> 29:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: He knew he had
suffered multiple
brain injuries, but believed
he'd get better.

29:58.063 --> 30:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eventually, Michael's commanders
forced him
to get help.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: And they
were like, and you have severe
post-traumatic

30:04.036 --> 30:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stress. And I -- I got upset.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So why did PTS
upset you?

30:09.775 --> 30:14.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: At that
time, I didn't think I had it.
Bought into

30:14.179 --> 30:15.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the stigma.

30:16.014 --> 30:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if there was a tangible
test, I think
it would make it easier on the
patients, but

30:19.351 --> 30:23.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- because it will validate it.
You know,
like if someone has leukemia, no
one ever

30:23.088 --> 30:24.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
says, you don't have leukemia.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Right.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL
RODRIGUEZ: So, if there
was some, say, type of biomarker
or something

30:27.092 --> 30:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like that, yes, then I think it
would definitely
help.

30:29.327 --> 30:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SAM MCLEAN, University of
North Carolina
at Chapel Hill: Yes, we're
really living in

30:34.232 --> 30:37.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the dark ages of post-traumatic
stress diagnosis.

30:37.035 --> 30:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Dr. Sam McLean
is a doctor
of emergency medicine and
anesthesiology at

30:42.908 --> 30:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the University of North Carolina
at Chapel
Hill.

30:45.811 --> 30:51.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is one of a group of
researchers around
the country trying to nail down
a more specific

30:51.450 --> 30:53.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diagnosis of PTSD.

30:53.351 --> 30:59.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SAM MCLEAN: We hope to
advance the diagnosis
of post-traumatic stress by
assessing what's

30:59.191 --> 31:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on in the brain, not
simply a symptom
checklist, getting at the actual
biology that's

31:04.896 --> 31:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
underlying those symptoms.

31:06.765 --> 31:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Researchers at
the University
of North Carolina are decoding
blood samples

31:11.536 --> 31:17.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken from recent trauma victims
at civilian
emergency rooms. They're
sequencing genetic

31:17.209 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
material, RNA, DNA and other
types of molecules,
to identify biological markers
for PTSD.

31:24.116 --> 31:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SAM MCLEAN: The blood is
such a valuable
tool to use to better understand
what's going

31:29.521 --> 31:33.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on with post-traumatic stress,
because, after
traumatic event, the brain
communicates with

31:34.025 --> 31:35.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the body via the blood.

31:35.894 --> 31:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: To find out how
PTSD physically
changes the brain, researchers
at the Veterans

31:41.700 --> 31:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Affairs Health Facility just
outside of Boston
are using MRIs to look at brain
structure

31:47.405 --> 31:53.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and volume, as well as
connectivity, to see
how different areas of the brain
talk to each

31:53.278 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

31:55.147 --> 31:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SAM MCLEAN: The goal that we
need to get
to is get to the point where
there is a certain

31:58.683 --> 32:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accurate molecular diagnosis
that we can make.
I'm hopeful that that is going
to happen within

32:05.290 --> 32:07.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our lifetime.

32:07.192 --> 32:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Kelly Rodriguez
is Michael's
wife. She's a platoon sergeant
with the 18th

32:14.699 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg in
North Carolina.
She too suffers from PTSD. She
practically

32:21.239 --> 32:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had to beg her doctors to get an
accurate
diagnosis.

32:24.209 --> 32:27.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many deployments have you
done in your
20-plus years?

32:27.412 --> 32:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ,
U.S. Army:
Five.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What was your
most traumatizing
posting?

32:33.018 --> 32:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
My last deployment.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: In Afghanistan.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
In Afghanistan
2009 to 2010.

32:39.291 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Kelly served as
a medic,
treating casualties from one of
the bloodiest

32:44.229 --> 32:50.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks on U.S. troops in
Afghanistan. Kelly
and her team saw hundreds of
trauma patients

32:50.802 --> 32:53.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go through the operating room
that year.

32:53.271 --> 32:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
It's not just
engaging in combat. It's seeing
it. And when

32:59.244 --> 33:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have soldiers come in, and
they're literally
holding their jaw because they
just got hit

33:05.951 --> 33:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the face with a rocket, or an
NCO came
in, and he's holding his arm.

33:12.290 --> 33:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: One patient hit
her the hardest,
a female soldier who volunteered
for a convoy

33:18.797 --> 33:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so she could see her husband
before he shipped
out.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
The convoy
was hit and -- by an IED.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: By an IED?

33:27.305 --> 33:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
she was alive
when she got to us, but she
died. And her

33:33.945 --> 33:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
husband was there. And I think
the reason
it was really hard is because,
if Michael

33:36.648 --> 33:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was downrange, I would have done
the same
thing. That could have been me.

33:42.020 --> 33:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: After returning
home, Kelly
suspected that she might have
PTSD, but trying

33:48.493 --> 33:53.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get an accurate diagnosis was
a difficult
ordeal for her too.

33:53.131 --> 33:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
It came down
to screaming. Find out if it is
PTS. Great.

33:58.603 --> 34:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's not, great. One way or
the other,
I need something, besides, you
have got anxiety

34:03.608 --> 34:04.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and you're depressed.

34:04.576 --> 34:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, you know, so does half of
America.

34:07.646 --> 34:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: It took more
than two years
before Kelly was finally
diagnosed with PTSD.

34:12.784 --> 34:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
You can't
treat it if you don't put your
hands on it,

34:16.254 --> 34:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put a name on it. And that's
why, for me,
it was frustrating trying to get
any diagnosis.

34:23.428 --> 34:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: A shortfall
they both hope
science will someday resolve.

34:30.135 --> 34:35.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Will someone who is just
entering the military
10 years from now have a
completely different

34:35.507 --> 34:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experience, do you think, than
you both had?

34:37.309 --> 34:40.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL

is. That would be fantastic.

SGT. 1ST CLASS KELLY RODRIGUEZ:
Because, at
the end of the day, if there is
something

34:43.348 --> 34:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on with them, they want to
know what
it is.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Our series War on
the Brain
concludes Friday with a look at
the efforts

34:56.695 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to find the true cause of PTSD.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump promised often
during the
campaign to improve America's
standing across

35:12.010 --> 35:13.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the globe.

35:13.912 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, more than two months in
office, Mr. Trump
has shaken up the world stage,
from dust-ups

35:18.583 --> 35:22.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with longtime allies to
continued questions
about Russia.

35:22.754 --> 35:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examine the administration's
foreign policy
now with two veteran lawmakers
who helped

35:27.892 --> 35:34.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to shape U.S. national security,
former Republican
Senator Richard Lugar, and
former Democratic

35:34.099 --> 35:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman Lee Hamilton, both
from Indiana.
They are now both distinguished
scholars at

35:39.604 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Indiana University.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome to the "NewsHour" to
both of you.

35:44.442 --> 35:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reported
today -- and I
will start with you, Senator
Lugar -- that

35:48.646 --> 35:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States is expanding
-- expanding
and deepening its military
involvement in

35:54.753 --> 36:01.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East under President
Trump in Iraq,
in Syria, in Yemen. At the same
time, he's

36:01.826 --> 36:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
calling for cutbacks in spending
on diplomacy.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think of this
approach?

36:08.466 --> 36:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD LUGAR (R), Former U.S.
Senator: Well,
I believe the approach is very
fearful.

36:12.370 --> 36:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we really need to have all
of our alliances
as strong as possible. I mean,
as a matter

36:19.611 --> 36:26.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of fact, to have a military
strategy for the
Middle East, as opposed to a few
troops that

36:26.184 --> 36:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going here and there at
various times,
I'm really concerned about the
president's

36:34.592 --> 36:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lack of enthusiasm for NATO, for
example.

36:38.997 --> 36:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm worried about our -- even
the alliance
problems in our own hemisphere
with the NAFTA,

36:45.837 --> 36:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite apart from those ties with
the Far East.
In other words, we need to reach
out, offering

36:50.508 --> 36:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leadership in the world. And we
need to be
finding new allies, new people
to help us.

36:56.281 --> 37:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Middle East will not be
solved by a few
Americans who are sent over
there, even if

37:01.886 --> 37:03.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we augment that by a few more.

37:03.922 --> 37:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Hamilton, your
take on the first two months of
this presidency

37:07.425 --> 37:09.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on foreign policy?

37:09.227 --> 37:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE HAMILTON (D), Former U.S.
Congressman:
Well, I agree very much with
what Dick said.

37:13.731 --> 37:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to have I a strong
military and be
prepared to use it on occasion
as a last resort.

37:22.140 --> 37:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you certainly have to have
strong diplomacy.

37:26.444 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost all of these problems
that we're dealing
with, I think all of them,
ultimately have

37:31.716 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a political solution. You do not
get that
kind of a solution through
military action.

37:38.690 --> 37:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get it through diplomacy,
negotiations,
consultations, endless meetings,
and conversations

37:46.498 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of all kinds with your friends
and your enemies.

37:50.668 --> 37:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need a strong diplomatic
effort in order
to advance our interests in the
world.

37:56.908 --> 38:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, between the
two of you,
you served, I think, a total of
more than

38:00.879 --> 38:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- of 70 years, between the U.S.
Senate and
the U.S. House.

38:05.617 --> 38:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Lugar, what is it
exactly that you
would like to see the president
do when it

38:09.320 --> 38:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes to diplomacy that he isn't
doing right
now?

38:11.856 --> 38:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD LUGAR: Well, first of
all, he needs
to indicate that we are not
going to cut the

38:16.928 --> 38:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
budget of the State Department,
that we're
not going to cut foreign aid or
potential

38:22.400 --> 38:25.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assistance even to starving
people around
the world.

38:25.270 --> 38:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, we really need a
burst of
enthusiasm for American
humanitarianism, American

38:32.810 --> 38:38.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reach-out to other countries and
other people.
We have those resources here.
They're tremendously

38:38.783 --> 38:40.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important.

38:40.552 --> 38:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are the leader. It won't
do really
just to augment the defense
budgets, while

38:45.490 --> 38:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're cutting back foreign aid
and you're
cutting back on treaties. We
have already

38:51.029 --> 38:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen the dissolution of the
Pacific pact.
That's a treaty for foreign
trade.

38:56.534 --> 39:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are already seeing the
diminishing interest
of foreign trade generally by
the president,

39:03.241 --> 39:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a diminishing of Americans
accepting other
people coming into our country.

39:08.846 --> 39:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really need to sort of
reverse these courses
and get back into American
leadership.

39:13.718 --> 39:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
note that is
coming from a Republican.

39:17.021 --> 39:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representative Hamilton, what is
the formula
that you see? What would you
like to see this

39:22.260 --> 39:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president do, say that we
haven't heard or
seen so far?

39:26.831 --> 39:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE HAMILTON: Look, I think
American leadership
in the world is absolutely
necessary.

39:33.471 --> 39:39.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I come from the school of
thought -- and I
think Dick does too -- that
American leadership,

39:39.110 --> 39:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though not perfect, we make
mistakes, is crucial
to progress in the world,
economic growth,

39:47.118 --> 39:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peace and stability, extension
of freedom
and liberty to all people.

39:52.857 --> 39:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to step forward and
take on that
burden of leadership. And that's
what the

39:57.762 --> 40:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president has to do. If you look
back over
the past hundred days or so of
the Trump administration,

40:05.136 --> 40:11.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all of the news has been
internal or external
problems of the Trump
administration.

40:11.576 --> 40:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's having a very hard time
getting started
and exerting his authority as a
president

40:18.549 --> 40:23.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of these internal and
some external
problems.

40:23.288 --> 40:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world needs our leadership
in all kinds
of ways. And we have to step up
to that responsibility.

40:29.861 --> 40:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if we do not do it, then
others will
fill the vacuum. We have a
marvelous record

40:37.001 --> 40:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of global leadership over
decades since World
War II. We have got a -- we see
signs now

40:43.741 --> 40:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that that leadership may be
waning in some
respects.

40:48.279 --> 40:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to step up our game,
assert our
leadership. And President Trump
has to take

40:54.652 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lead on that, so that the
United States
can fulfill the expectations of
the world

41:02.694 --> 41:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for our leadership for good
around the world.

41:06.164 --> 41:11.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two distinguished
American
lawmakers, Representative Lee
Hamilton, Senator

41:11.636 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Richard Lugar.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very good to see both of
you again. We
thank you.

41:15.840 --> 41:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD LUGAR: Thanks so much.

41:20.178 --> 41:23.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEE HAMILTON: Thank you.

41:23.681 --> 41:29.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: teaching the
youngest
of kids about the basics of
money.

41:29.921 --> 41:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent Paul
Solman looks
at how parents can help their
children learn

41:34.592 --> 41:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more about personal finance.

41:36.828 --> 41:40.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of his series Making
Sense, which
airs every Thursday.

41:40.398 --> 41:44.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: Maybe there's some candy
in there.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In Arlington,
Virginia, an unusual
venue for little kids.

41:47.372 --> 41:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER, Personal Finance
Expert: Who
knows where we are now?

41:48.773 --> 41:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: America, Virginia,
Washington, D.C.,
at the bank.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What does a bank
do?

41:54.178 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: A bank gives you money
and stuff.

41:57.148 --> 42:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: They just hand it
out?

42:00.451 --> 42:01.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: I think so.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Where does the bank
get money?

42:03.454 --> 42:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: I think it gets it from a
sock.

42:06.457 --> 42:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: From a sock?

42:07.792 --> 42:09.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: A sock?

42:09.560 --> 42:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Personal finance guru Beth
Kobliner thinks
kids should be learning about
money early.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But they're not.

42:15.566 --> 42:20.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: I think parents
are much more
likely to talk about sex or
drugs or alcohol

42:20.738 --> 42:22.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with their children than they
are about money.

42:22.940 --> 42:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kobliner hopes to
break the taboo
with a new book, "Make Your Kid
a Money Genius,"

42:29.046 --> 42:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that continues work she's been
doing for years.

42:33.651 --> 42:38.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kobliner has been teaching key
concepts in
economics. She insists kids can
learn them

42:38.890 --> 42:40.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
young.

42:40.691 --> 42:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BETH KOBLINER: By age 3,
children can understand
basic money concepts like
exchange, or we

42:49.000 --> 42:52.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to make choices, or things
have a value.

42:52.370 --> 42:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those conversations are
important to start
when kids are really little. By
age 7, a lot

42:58.142 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of those behaviors to do with
money, whether
it's self-control or delayed
gratification,

43:03.748 --> 43:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they start getting set. So,
those ages 3 to
7, it's really kind of a nice
sweet spot in

43:09.854 --> 43:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which parents should be talking
to their kids
about money.

43:12.457 --> 43:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We gathered our own
group of
kids to try it out.

43:16.527 --> 43:19.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do people get money to give
to the bank?

43:19.363 --> 43:24.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: My mommy and daddy work
and get money.
And they buy milk for me.

43:24.735 --> 43:26.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There you go?

43:26.671 --> 43:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you're how old? You're? Just
3 years old.

43:30.942 --> 43:36.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another key concept all kids
should know,
says Kobliner: what it means to
work for a

43:36.414 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
living, like here at the
"NewsHour."

43:38.349 --> 43:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: You bring your
kid to your
office, and they see where you
work. This

43:42.086 --> 43:46.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman I know, she said her dad
would leave
every morning when she was
little with a newspaper

43:46.591 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under his arm. And she thought,
oh, my dad's
job is reading the newspaper
every day.

43:51.729 --> 43:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then years later, she found
out, oh, he's
a teacher. Parents say, you know
how hard

43:55.933 --> 44:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worked to make money for you?
And kids are
like, oh, I guess so.

44:00.838 --> 44:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kobliner also
advises teaching
kids to internalize the
nonmaterial payoffs

44:07.512 --> 44:09.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from work by having them do
some.

44:09.947 --> 44:15.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: Having a child do
chores at
a really young age, we're
talking about household

44:15.786 --> 44:19.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chores, putting your dishes in
the sink, putting
it in the dishwasher, putting
your clothes

44:19.824 --> 44:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the hamper, that type of
thing at an early
ages of 3, 4, 5 years old was
one predictor

44:26.163 --> 44:27.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of success in life.

44:27.431 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like getting a
degree or starting
a career.

44:31.068 --> 44:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kobliner also touts a trendy
gimmick for teaching
kids the uses of money.

44:35.773 --> 44:38.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: There are three
different jars
here. One is for...

44:38.976 --> 44:39.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILDREN: Savings.

44:39.977 --> 44:41.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: This one is for?

44:41.746 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILDREN: Spending.

44:42.747 --> 44:44.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: And this one is
for?

44:44.849 --> 44:46.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILDREN: Sharing.

44:46.851 --> 44:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The key concept
here, opportunity
cost. If you spend, you don't
have the opportunity

44:52.423 --> 44:53.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to save or share.

44:53.824 --> 44:56.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: Which do you want
to do? Do
you want to save it?

44:56.394 --> 44:57.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Share it.

44:58.029 --> 45:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: You want to share
it? What
would you do? You can either
save it...

45:01.966 --> 45:04.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: Oh, my gosh. I know which
one.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: Which one? Tell
me.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: I'm under the table.

45:07.638 --> 45:08.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BETH KOBLINER: Spend.

45:08.639 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Where are you,
Vera?

45:10.241 --> 45:12.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: I'm under the table.

45:12.109 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Those of you who
ducked out of
econ lectures in school might
sympathize with

45:15.613 --> 45:17.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Vera's time-out moment.

45:17.582 --> 45:19.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the professor, unfazed,
pushed on.

45:19.150 --> 45:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: So, why do you
want to spend
it? What would you spend it on?

45:23.588 --> 45:24.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: Minecraft toys.

45:24.889 --> 45:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: Minecraft toys.
Oh.

45:27.058 --> 45:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Whitleigh Wilks
(ph) decided
to put one dollar in each of the
jars.

45:31.529 --> 45:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: That's very
interesting. Why
did you do that?

45:34.999 --> 45:38.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: Because I want to do all,
all three
in here.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: In savings? Wow.

45:40.137 --> 45:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what are you
saving for?

45:42.340 --> 45:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: College. College and high
school.

45:44.308 --> 45:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Teaching kids to
save, says Kobliner,
was just teaching them to wait,
as in the

45:50.982 --> 45:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
famous marshmallow experiment.

45:52.883 --> 45:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: All right, here's the
deal. Marshmallow
for you. You can either wait,
and I will give

45:57.822 --> 46:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you another one if you wait. You
can either
eat it right now, or you can
wait. Either

46:01.225 --> 46:02.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

46:02.226 --> 46:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We ran our own
mental version.

46:04.228 --> 46:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suppose I had a marshmallow in
front of you
now and I said, if you don't eat
it for 15

46:09.033 --> 46:10.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minutes...

46:10.034 --> 46:11.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: I would eat it.

46:11.869 --> 46:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You would eat it
right away,
even though I say I would give
you two later?

46:15.339 --> 46:16.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: Mm-hmm.

46:16.641 --> 46:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You would eat it
right -- what
would you do?

46:17.908 --> 46:19.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: I would wait a little
while.

46:19.810 --> 46:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Could you wait?

46:22.213 --> 46:28.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHILD: Yes. I would play with my
LEGOs. If
there was a fire, I would just
cook it.

46:28.919 --> 46:34.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, no
marshmallow toasting
in the actual experiment. Kids
were left alone

46:34.392 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a room with the mouthwatering
morsel right
in front of them. In follow-up
studies, those

46:39.930 --> 46:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who waited longer actually fared
better in
life.

46:43.467 --> 46:51.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: They had 200
points on average
higher on their SATs. They had
better interpersonal

46:51.676 --> 46:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationships, and even had
lower body mass
indexes.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

46:57.014 --> 46:59.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: It feels at first
like, oh,
it's because these kids have
this strong moral

46:59.383 --> 47:00.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fiber.

47:00.384 --> 47:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And higher I.Q. or
something.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: And they're able
to resist
it.

47:03.454 --> 47:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also know now it's more
the ability
to distract themselves. That's
an important

47:09.794 --> 47:16.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trait to have. People who are
able to have
impulse control or delayed
gratification are

47:16.801 --> 47:18.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to save more money.

47:18.736 --> 47:22.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But how to
encourage kids to
delay gratification?

47:22.707 --> 47:26.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Start, says Kobliner, by not
giving in to
every demand.

47:26.677 --> 47:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: You know, we're
going to go
into the store right now and
we're only getting

47:31.348 --> 47:35.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things we need.

47:35.853 --> 47:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Research is showing, when you
say yes all
the time, all the time, all the
time, you

47:40.324 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are basically making it harder
for your kid
to experience impulse control,
just like another

47:47.398 --> 47:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
study found those kids were more
likely to
be in debt problems because they
always got

47:54.338 --> 47:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they wanted when they
wanted it.

47:56.107 --> 47:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Beth is going to
give you some
real money.

47:59.143 --> 48:02.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last stop, a bakery near
"NewsHour" offices
in Arlington, Virginia.

48:02.580 --> 48:06.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: You want to save
it, share
it, or spend it?

48:06.117 --> 48:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We gave each kid
$3.

48:08.452 --> 48:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: What do you want
to do?

48:11.455 --> 48:12.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: I will share it.

48:12.957 --> 48:15.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: You want to share
it? Who are
you going to share it with?

48:15.926 --> 48:16.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: With him.

48:16.927 --> 48:18.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BETH KOBLINER: Oh.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: With me? Oh, that
is so sweet,
Vera.

48:19.830 --> 48:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turns out, however, that the
allure of an
almost-$3 dollar cupcake was
irresistible.

48:23.234 --> 48:31.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, everyone succumbed,
providing
Kobliner with a segue to another
of her concepts.

48:31.208 --> 48:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: Is it better to
buy things
with a credit card or with
dollar money, paper

48:37.047 --> 48:38.015 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money?

48:38.048 --> 48:39.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: Dollar money.

48:39.049 --> 48:43.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: I would do credit card.

48:43.487 --> 48:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Credit card? You
think credit
card is better?

48:45.790 --> 48:51.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: I think it's better to
use a credit
card, so you can save money.

48:51.262 --> 48:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You won't be
surprised to hear
that Kobliner recommends cash,
so kids are

48:55.766 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aware they're actually spending
when they
buy something.

48:58.502 --> 49:03.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETH KOBLINER: They don't see
cash any more.
They see cards being swiped and
phones now

49:03.474 --> 49:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being swiped with Venmo and
Apple pay and
all these ways of paying for
things.

49:09.213 --> 49:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An MIT study found that when
people use a
card, they spend up to twice as
much then

49:15.319 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when they use cash.

49:17.121 --> 49:22.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As for paying off
credit cards
to avoid interest, OK, hold that
until middle

49:22.593 --> 49:24.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

49:24.161 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, Kobliner acknowledges
that teaching
econ to tots isn't always easy.

49:29.099 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do you now think it's better
to buy with
cash than a credit card?

49:34.772 --> 49:39.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: Because -- because, like
-- I don't
know.

49:39.577 --> 49:44.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But why not start
trying sooner,
rather than later?

49:44.748 --> 49:47.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can I have a bite of yours too?

49:47.284 --> 49:50.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, the results can be
simply delicious.

49:50.421 --> 49:53.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mmm. Thank you so much.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is economics correspondent
Paul Solman.

49:55.593 --> 50:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: And he is reporting from
Best Buns
Bakery.

50:00.931 --> 50:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, delicious.

50:05.836 --> 50:09.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: Thank you.

50:09.506 --> 50:16.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask people

50:16.080 --> 50:17.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about their passions.

50:17.948 --> 50:23.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well before the recent worldwide
women's general
strike, award-winning actress
Kathleen Turner

50:23.754 --> 50:29.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been advocating for women's
equality.
Her new book is "Send Yourself
Roses."

50:29.260 --> 50:34.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: My favorite line in
film is something
that you said in "Body Heat."

50:34.265 --> 50:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHLEEN TURNER, Actress: Oh. I
know the one.

50:36.000 --> 50:48.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"You're not too smart, are you?
I like that
in a man."

50:48.279 --> 50:52.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I came to New York, I
wanted to be a
Broadway star. I always sort of
thought film

50:52.850 --> 51:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened to me. I thought, OK,
better learn
this quick. "Body Heat" was my
first film.

51:01.525 --> 51:05.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was 25 when they cast me.

51:05.629 --> 51:15.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's probably
everybody's favorite
moment when he smashes the
window in. Come

51:15.239 --> 51:19.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on. That's hot.

51:19.543 --> 51:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I certainly like to push the
envelope, if
not tear it. Most of my films
are new territory.

51:27.584 --> 51:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at "Crimes of
Passion," that was
certainly unheard of. The comedy
in "The Man

51:33.857 --> 51:36.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
With Two Brains."

51:36.927 --> 51:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1990, I decided then to go
back to Broadway
to do "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"
and, yes, I

51:44.034 --> 51:49.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got calls from Michael Douglas,
Jack Nicholson,
to say, don't do it, don't do
it. You will

51:49.640 --> 51:55.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have this big target on your
back. You know,
they think of you as a movie
star, and they

51:55.179 --> 52:01.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be out to get you on the
stage. My answer
was, no, you don't understand.
I'm better

on stage.

When I get very nervous or
something, my response
is to get cocky. When doing
theater, you are

52:10.794 --> 52:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a performance mode, right up
through 11:00
at night. Everything you do is
about that

52:16.433 --> 52:18.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
curtain going up at 8:00.

52:18.302 --> 52:27.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is addictively alive. I
have said that
I am no good at playing victims.
I don't believe

52:27.111 --> 52:32.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have ever thought of it as the
enforcer
role, decisive perhaps,
assertive. What would

52:32.716 --> 52:42.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be called decisive certainly in
a male role
is probably called difficult in
a woman, which

52:42.726 --> 52:45.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is really, you know, stupid.

52:45.763 --> 52:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forty percent of the American
families are,
the woman is the major
breadwinner. Take that.

Years ago, in all my speeches, I
would propose
a woman's stop day. Don't go to
the office.

53:01.478 --> 53:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't show up on the set. Just
sit down. Certainly,
we would show everyone our value
to the country,

53:11.088 --> 53:16.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, maybe more important, we
would show ourselves.

My name is Kathleen Turner, and
this is my
Brief But Spectacular take on my
body of work

53:24.034 --> 53:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
