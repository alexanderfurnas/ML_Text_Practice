00:11.111 --> 00:13.413
FOR SATURDAY, JUNE 27: AFTER A

00:13.413 --> 00:15.048
DRAMATIC WEEK AT THE SUPREME

00:15.048 --> 00:16.550
COURT, A LOOK AT SOME DECISIONS

00:16.550 --> 00:18.852
STILL TO COME; EXAMINING THE

00:18.852 --> 00:20.621
CASES AGAINST SUSPECTED ISIS

00:20.621 --> 00:23.257
MEMBERS HERE AT HOME; AND IN OUR

00:23.257 --> 00:24.858
SIGNATURE SEGMENT, THE DAMAGING

00:24.858 --> 00:26.727
EFFECTS STRESS CAN HAVE ON YOUNG

00:26.727 --> 00:28.462
CHILDREN, ESPECIALLY THOSE

00:28.462 --> 00:29.630
LIVING IN POVERTY.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.397
>> Reporter: ONE NIGHT, THE

00:30.397 --> 00:31.665
CHILDREN ASLEEP UPSTAIRS,

00:31.665 --> 00:33.367
BULLETS CAME FLYING THROUGH THE

00:33.367 --> 00:35.402
WINDOWS AND DOOR, JUST FEET FROM

00:35.402 --> 00:36.837
WHERE SHE WAS SITTING.

00:36.837 --> 00:37.704
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:37.704 --> 00:39.473
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.441
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS OF

00:41.441 --> 00:43.110
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:43.110 --> 00:44.745
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.679
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:45.679 --> 00:46.546
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.714
EVEN THOUGH THE U.S. SUPREME

00:47.714 --> 00:48.982
COURT RULED FRIDAY THAT THE

00:48.982 --> 00:50.951
CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES SAME-SEX

00:50.951 --> 00:52.452
COUPLES THE RIGHT TO MARRY IN

00:52.452 --> 00:54.221
ALL 50 STATES, SOME STATES ARE

00:54.221 --> 00:55.956
NOT ISSUING MARRIAGE LICENSES,

00:55.956 --> 00:56.957
AT LEAST NOT YET.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.125
HOPEFUL COUPLES HAVE BEEN TURNED

00:58.125 --> 00:59.826
AWAY IN PARTS OF MISSISSIPPI,

00:59.826 --> 01:01.695
ALABAMA, TEXAS AND LOUISIANA.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.796
SOME OFFICIALS SAY THEY'RE

01:02.796 --> 01:04.164
WAITING FOR LOWER COURTS TO

01:04.164 --> 01:06.533
OFFICIALLY LIFT BANS ON SAME-SEX

01:06.533 --> 01:07.167
MARRIAGE.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.235
MISSISSIPPI'S ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:08.235 --> 01:09.836
SAID THAT'S WHY THE SUPREME

01:09.836 --> 01:10.971
COURT'S DECISION IS NOT

01:10.971 --> 01:13.006
IMMEDIATELY EFFECTIVE THERE.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.441
ALABAMA'S SUPREME COURT CHIEF

01:14.441 --> 01:16.243
JUSTICE IS ADVISING COUNTY

01:16.243 --> 01:18.245
JUDGES TO DELAY ISSUING THE

01:18.245 --> 01:19.680
MARRIAGE LICENSES, SAYING THE

01:19.680 --> 01:21.481
RULING "DESTROYED THE FOUNDATION

01:21.481 --> 01:22.783
OF OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS

01:22.783 --> 01:23.717
FAMILY."

01:23.717 --> 01:25.285
IN TEXAS, SOME COUNTY CLERKS DID

01:25.285 --> 01:26.853
ISSUE LICENSES, BUT GOVERNOR

01:26.853 --> 01:28.789
GREG ABBOTT SAYS NO TEXAN WILL

01:28.789 --> 01:30.223
BE REQUIRED BY THE SUPREME

01:30.223 --> 01:32.459
COURT'S DECISION TO ACT CONTRARY

01:32.459 --> 01:34.461
TO HIS OR HER RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

01:34.461 --> 01:35.595
REGARDING MARRIAGE.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.596
LOUISIANA GOVERNOR AND

01:36.596 --> 01:37.631
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL

01:37.631 --> 01:38.999
CANDIDATE BOBBY JINDAL SAYS THE

01:38.999 --> 01:40.600
HIGH COURT'S DECISION TRAMPLES

01:40.600 --> 01:42.803
ON STATES' RIGHTS ONCE PROTECTED

01:42.803 --> 01:44.571
BY THE 10th AMENDMENT.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.340
TWO WOMEN MARRIED IN CONNECTICUT

01:46.340 --> 01:47.908
SAY THEY HOPE MISSISSIPPI WILL

01:47.908 --> 01:50.077
RECOGNIZE THEIR UNION SOON.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.112
>> I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.380
THIS IS MY HOME STATE.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.282
I WANT TO BE LEGALLY MARRIED IN

01:55.282 --> 01:56.283
MY HOME STATE.

01:56.283 --> 01:56.950
>> Sreenivasan: JOINING ME NOW

01:56.950 --> 01:57.884
IS THE CHIEF WASHINGTON

01:57.884 --> 01:58.852
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE "NATIONAL

01:58.852 --> 02:00.420
LAW JOURNAL," MARCIA COYLE.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.355
SO, MARCIA, YESTERDAY WE TALKED

02:01.355 --> 02:02.689
A LOT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE

02:02.689 --> 02:04.424
GAY MARGE RULING, BUT THERE ARE

02:04.424 --> 02:05.926
A COUPLE OF OTHER BIG RULINGS.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.227
I MEAN, NO COURT RULINGS AT THE

02:07.227 --> 02:08.495
SUPREME COURT ARE SMALL, BUT THE

02:08.495 --> 02:09.529
ONES THAT ARE COMING UP ON

02:09.529 --> 02:10.897
MONDAY ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT.

02:10.897 --> 02:11.498
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:11.498 --> 02:12.065
THAT.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.000
>> ABSOLUTELY, HARI.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.301
THERE ARE THREE CASES THAT ARE

02:14.301 --> 02:15.502
LEFT.

02:15.502 --> 02:18.005
THERE IS A VERY IMPORTANT CASE

02:18.005 --> 02:19.940
INVOLVING THE ENVIRONMENT AND

02:19.940 --> 02:21.575
THE AUTHORITY OF THE

02:21.575 --> 02:23.643
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

02:23.643 --> 02:25.746
TO REGULATE MERCURY EMISSIONS

02:25.746 --> 02:28.715
FROM ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.917
IN THAT CASE, IT'S A QUESTION OF

02:30.917 --> 02:33.387
WHETHER THE E.P.A., THE FEDERAL

02:33.387 --> 02:35.255
AGENCY, SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED

02:35.255 --> 02:37.290
THE COST OF ITS REGULATION

02:37.290 --> 02:38.725
BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO

02:38.725 --> 02:42.029
REGULATE THE MERCURY EMISSIONS.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.296
THERE'S A SECOND CASE THAT'S

02:43.296 --> 02:46.033
VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HOW

02:46.033 --> 02:48.301
STATES-- STATE LEGISLATURES, IN

02:48.301 --> 02:50.203
PARTICULAR-- REAPPORTION

02:50.203 --> 02:51.972
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.408
ARIZONA CREATED AN INDEPENDENT

02:54.408 --> 02:56.877
COMMISSION TO DO THE REDRAWING

02:56.877 --> 02:59.446
OF DISTRICT LINES FOLLOWING EACH

02:59.446 --> 03:00.414
CENSUS.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.715
AND IT DID THAT BECAUSE, AS

03:01.715 --> 03:02.816
WE'VE SEEN ALL AROUND THE

03:02.816 --> 03:05.018
COUNTRY, REDISTRICTING HAS

03:05.018 --> 03:07.754
BECOME A VERY PARTISAN EFFORT IN

03:07.754 --> 03:09.189
STATE LEGISLATURES.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.591
THE ARIZONA STATE LEGISLATURE

03:11.591 --> 03:13.460
CHALLENGED THE USE OF AN

03:13.460 --> 03:15.629
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION, CLAIMING

03:15.629 --> 03:17.764
THAT IT VIOLATED THE ELECTIONS

03:17.764 --> 03:19.199
CLAUSE IN THE FEDERAL

03:19.199 --> 03:22.335
CONSTITUTION; CLAIMS THAT THAT

03:22.335 --> 03:25.405
CLAUSE GIVES THE AUTHORITY, THE

03:25.405 --> 03:27.941
RIGHT TO STATE LEGISLATURES TO

03:27.941 --> 03:30.010
REDRAW DISTRICT LINES.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.878
AND FINALLY, THE DEATH PENALTY,

03:31.878 --> 03:33.280
WHICH IS NEVER FAR FROM THE

03:33.280 --> 03:35.182
SUPREME COURT'S DOCKET.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.617
THIS IS A CASE INVOLVING LETHAL

03:37.617 --> 03:39.586
INJECTION AND A PARTICULAR DRUG,

03:39.586 --> 03:42.722
MIDAZOLAM, THAT WAS USED BY

03:42.722 --> 03:45.325
OKLAHOMA NOT TOO LONG AGO AS A

03:45.325 --> 03:48.328
REPLACEMENT DRUG FOR THE DRUG IN

03:48.328 --> 03:50.730
ITS THREE-DRUG PROTOCOL THAT IS

03:50.730 --> 03:52.732
USUALLY USED TO MAKE SOMEONE

03:52.732 --> 03:55.135
UNCONSCIOUS WHILE THE OTHER TWO

03:55.135 --> 03:56.903
DRUGS ARE ADMINISTERED.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.506
OKLAHOMA USED MIDAZOLAM AS A

03:59.506 --> 04:02.242
SUBSTITUTE, AND WE SAW REPORTS

04:02.242 --> 04:04.344
OF HOW THE DRUG REALLY DIDN'T

04:04.344 --> 04:07.414
MAKE SOMEONE... MAKE THE DEATH

04:07.414 --> 04:09.816
ROW INMATE UNCONSCIOUS LONG

04:09.816 --> 04:12.452
ENOUGH FOR THE OTHER DRUGS TO BE

04:12.452 --> 04:13.620
ADMINISTERED.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.423
AND IN SOME CASES, THE EXECUTION

04:16.423 --> 04:18.792
LASTED... ONE EXECUTION 20

04:18.792 --> 04:21.528
MINUTES; IN OTHERS THE INMATE

04:21.528 --> 04:23.396
WAS SEEN TO GASP; AND IN

04:23.396 --> 04:24.831
ANOTHER, THE INMATE ACTUALLY

04:24.831 --> 04:26.633
TALKED AND SAID, "THIS ISN'T

04:26.633 --> 04:27.634
WORKING."

04:27.634 --> 04:29.736
SO, A CHALLENGE HAS BEEN BROUGHT

04:29.736 --> 04:31.872
TO THE USE OF THAT PARTICULAR

04:31.872 --> 04:34.141
DRUG, AND WE WILL GET A DECISION

04:34.141 --> 04:36.042
I BELIEVE ON MONDAY AS TO

04:36.042 --> 04:37.978
WHETHER THAT... USE OF THAT DRUG

04:37.978 --> 04:39.646
IS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT

04:39.646 --> 04:41.982
UNDER THE 8th AMENDMENT TO THE

04:41.982 --> 04:43.650
CONSTITUTION.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.484
>> Sreenivasan: LOOKING BACK AT

04:44.484 --> 04:45.986
THE CASES, JUST IN THE HIGH-

04:45.986 --> 04:47.320
PROFILE CASE OF THE AFFORDABLE

04:47.320 --> 04:48.488
CARE ACT AND THE GAY MARRIAGE

04:48.488 --> 04:51.191
CASE, WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS

04:51.191 --> 04:52.425
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS IN HIS

04:52.425 --> 04:53.860
VOTE-- ONE DIRECTION IN ONE

04:53.860 --> 04:54.961
CASE, ANOTHER DIRECTION IN THE

04:54.961 --> 04:55.562
OTHER CASE.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.563
HE'S REALLY BECOME ONE OF THE

04:56.563 --> 04:59.299
MORE SURPRISING JUSTICES.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.801
>> IF WE TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM

05:01.801 --> 05:04.437
THIS PARTICULAR TERM, IT IS THAT

05:04.437 --> 05:06.540
EVEN THOUGH THE COURT HAS A

05:06.540 --> 05:08.375
FIVE-JUSTICE CONSERVATIVE

05:08.375 --> 05:10.243
MAJORITY, THOSE FIVE

05:10.243 --> 05:12.112
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT ALL THE

05:12.112 --> 05:14.748
SAME, JUST AS NOT ALL DEMOCRATS

05:14.748 --> 05:16.449
ARE THE SAME OR ALL CATHOLICS

05:16.449 --> 05:17.517
ARE THE SAME.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.386
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES

05:19.386 --> 05:22.222
TO HOW THEY INTERPRET STATUTES,

05:22.222 --> 05:24.324
HOW THEY READ THE CONSTITUTION.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.927
AND WE SAW THAT PLAY OUT IN THE

05:26.927 --> 05:28.995
HEALTH CARE CASE AS WELL AS

05:28.995 --> 05:30.530
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.731
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHILE THESE

05:31.731 --> 05:33.934
TWO CASES MIGHT BE WINS FOR

05:33.934 --> 05:35.769
LIBERAL THOUGHT, LIBERAL

05:35.769 --> 05:37.571
IDEOLOGY, THIS DOESN'T MAKE AN

05:37.571 --> 05:38.939
ENTIRE SEASON OR AN ENTIRE

05:38.939 --> 05:40.207
COURT.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.741
>> NO, IT DOESN'T, HARI, AND I

05:41.741 --> 05:44.244
THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS

05:44.244 --> 05:46.713
ABOUT LABELING THE COURT: "OKAY,

05:46.713 --> 05:49.349
SO NOW WE'VE HAD TWO LIBERAL...

05:49.349 --> 05:51.218
HUGE LIBERAL-LEANING DECISIONS.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.286
THIS IS A LIBERAL SUPREME

05:53.286 --> 05:54.454
COURT."

05:54.454 --> 05:57.257
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT EACH TERM

05:57.257 --> 05:59.960
TELLS ITS OWN STORY DEPENDING ON

05:59.960 --> 06:02.996
THE MAKEUP OF THE CASES, THE MIX

06:02.996 --> 06:05.365
OF CASES THAT COME TO THE COURT

06:05.365 --> 06:07.267
AND END UP ON ITS DOCKET.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.236
I CAN REMEMBER DURING THE

06:09.236 --> 06:11.371
REHNQUIST YEARS THAT THERE WERE

06:11.371 --> 06:13.473
SOME TERMS THAT WERE LEFT

06:13.473 --> 06:15.275
LEANING, OTHER TERMS THAT WERE

06:15.275 --> 06:16.443
RIGHT LEANING.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.878
THIS TERM, THE CASES THAT CAME

06:18.878 --> 06:21.381
PLAYED OUT TO THE LEFT SIDE OF

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
THE COURT.

06:22.382 --> 06:22.949
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

06:22.949 --> 06:24.317
MARCIA COYLE FROM THE "NATIONAL

06:24.317 --> 06:25.418
LAW JOURNAL," THANKS SO MUCH.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.120
>> OH, MY PLEASURE, HARI.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.822
TAKE CARE.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.589
>> Sreenivasan: ISIS HAS BEEN

06:29.589 --> 06:31.091
ATTACKING TARGETS THROUGHOUT THE

06:31.091 --> 06:32.392
MIDDLE EAST AND INCREASINGLY

06:32.392 --> 06:34.027
AROUND THE WORLD OVER THE PAST

06:34.027 --> 06:35.428
FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.896
ITS LEADERSHIP HAS ASKED FOR

06:36.896 --> 06:38.598
SUPPORTERS TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS

06:38.598 --> 06:40.300
WHEREVER THEY CAN, INCLUDING

06:40.300 --> 06:41.901
SOME SOFT TARGETS, PLACES LIKE

06:41.901 --> 06:43.837
CITY CENTERS AND RESORTS.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.038
YESTERDAY, THREE SEPARATE

06:45.038 --> 06:46.573
ATTACKS ON THREE CONTINENTS

06:46.573 --> 06:48.775
INJURED AND KILLED DOZENS.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.377
ITN'S NEIL CONNERY REPORTS FROM

06:50.377 --> 06:51.778
THE HOSPITAL WHERE MANY OF THE

06:51.778 --> 06:53.847
INJURED WERE TAKEN IN TUNISIA

06:53.847 --> 06:55.248
AFTER THE ATTACK AT A SEASIDE

06:55.248 --> 07:01.154
RESORT LEFT AT LEAST 38 DEAD.

07:01.154 --> 07:01.988
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE MOMENT

07:01.988 --> 07:05.191
TERROR ARRIVED IN SOUSSE.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.826
AS THE ATTACK GOT UNDER WAY,

07:06.826 --> 07:08.561
HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS, MANY OF

07:08.561 --> 07:10.664
THEM BRITISH, RAN FOR THEIR

07:10.664 --> 07:11.631
LIVES.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.466
ROSS THOMPSON AND REBECCA SMITH

07:13.466 --> 07:16.603
FROM COVENTRY WERE BOTH INJURED.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.338
ROSS WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT BUT

07:18.338 --> 07:20.206
KEPT RUNNING.

07:30.016 --> 07:30.550
>> Reporter: THE TRAUMA OF THE

07:30.550 --> 07:32.852
PAST 24 HOURS FILLS THESE

07:32.852 --> 07:34.821
HOSPITAL ROOMS.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.489
TONY CALLAHAN AND HIS WIFE ARE

07:36.489 --> 07:37.857
AMONG THE INJURED.

07:50.070 --> 07:50.837
>> Reporter: HE SHOWS ME THE

07:50.837 --> 07:52.706
BULLET-RIDDEN BELONGINGS WHICH

07:52.706 --> 07:54.407
SAVED HER LIFE.

08:13.860 --> 08:14.994
>> Reporter: SO MANY LIVES TAKEN

08:14.994 --> 08:18.064
HERE, SO MANY CHANGED FOREVER,

08:18.064 --> 08:20.266
AND SOME STILL HANGING IN THE

08:20.266 --> 08:22.569
BALANCE.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.436
>> Sreenivasan: MONDAY MARKS THE

08:23.436 --> 08:25.372
FIRST FULL YEAR SINCE ISIS

08:25.372 --> 08:26.906
DECLARED THE "CALIPHATE," AN

08:26.906 --> 08:28.108
ISLAMIC STATE, PART OF THE

08:28.108 --> 08:29.542
JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS TERROR

08:29.542 --> 08:31.244
CAMPAIGN ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.512
JUST THIS WEEK, ISIS CLAIMED

08:32.512 --> 08:33.446
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEADLY

08:33.446 --> 08:35.382
ATTACKS IN TUNISIA AND KUWAIT,

08:35.382 --> 08:37.217
AND IS SUSPECTED OF AN ATTACK IN

08:37.217 --> 08:38.184
FRANCE.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.285
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS

08:39.285 --> 08:40.553
ESTIMATED AT LEAST 2,700

08:40.553 --> 08:42.188
WESTERNERS HAVE TRAVELED TO JOIN

08:42.188 --> 08:44.557
ISIS IN THE FIGHTING IN SYRIA,

08:44.557 --> 08:46.326
INCLUDING SOME FROM THE U.S.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.094
NOW, A NEW STUDY FROM FORDHAM

08:48.094 --> 08:49.229
UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL SHOWS

08:49.229 --> 08:50.563
ARRESTS IN THE U.S. FOR

08:50.563 --> 08:52.432
ALLEGEDLY SUPPORTING ISIS ARE

08:52.432 --> 08:53.366
GROWING.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.902
SINCE LAST MARCH OF 2014,

08:55.902 --> 08:57.270
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE CHARGED

08:57.270 --> 08:59.472
56 PEOPLE FOR SUPPORTING ISIS.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.074
LAW ENFORCEMENT KILLED THREE

09:01.074 --> 09:02.509
OTHER SUSPECTS.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.210
FORDHAM RESEARCHERS SAY MOST OF

09:04.210 --> 09:06.780
THE ACCUSED ARE U.S. CITIZENS.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.215
MORE THAN 60% OF THOSE CHARGED

09:09.215 --> 09:11.351
ARE 21 OR YOUNGER, AND MORE THAN

09:11.351 --> 09:13.486
80% OF THE CASES INVOLVED

09:13.486 --> 09:15.588
RECRUITMENT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.790
I'M JOINED NOW BY THE HEAD OF

09:16.790 --> 09:17.824
THAT STUDY, THE DIRECTOR OF

09:17.824 --> 09:19.325
FORDHAM'S CENTER ON NATIONAL

09:19.325 --> 09:20.160
SECURITY, KAREN GREENBERG.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.261
SO, FIRST, I WANT TO ASK, WHAT

09:21.261 --> 09:23.630
DO WE SEE ABOUT THE PATTERNS OF

09:23.630 --> 09:24.664
THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

09:24.664 --> 09:26.433
ACCUSED AND CHARGED BUT NOT YET

09:26.433 --> 09:27.400
FOUND GUILTY?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.401
>> THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE

09:28.401 --> 09:30.203
CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS BEING

09:30.203 --> 09:32.038
CHARGED: THOSE WHO WANT TO

09:32.038 --> 09:34.007
FACILITATE AND RECRUIT OTHERS TO

09:34.007 --> 09:36.109
JOIN ISIS; THOSE WHO WANT TO GO

09:36.109 --> 09:37.510
ABROAD AS FOREIGN FIGHTERS TO

09:37.510 --> 09:39.112
JOIN THE CALIPHATE; AND THOSE

09:39.112 --> 09:41.014
WHO WANT TO COMMIT SOME KIND OF

09:41.014 --> 09:42.415
DOMESTIC TERROR ATTACK IN THE

09:42.415 --> 09:43.516
UNITED STATES.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.018
AND THE PATTERNS ARE LARGELY

09:45.018 --> 09:46.252
THAT THESE ARE INCREASINGLY

09:46.252 --> 09:49.289
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE

09:49.289 --> 09:50.824
DRAWN TO ISIS FOR A VARIETY OF

09:50.824 --> 09:52.692
REASONS, WHO ARE FROM AN

09:52.692 --> 09:55.328
EXCEPTIONALLY BROAD BACKGROUND.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.863
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAY A

09:56.863 --> 09:58.097
PARTICULAR ETHNIC GROUP OR

09:58.097 --> 09:59.499
NATIONAL ORIGIN OR RELIGION OR

09:59.499 --> 10:02.035
ANYTHING INITIALLY IS WHAT

10:02.035 --> 10:03.369
MOTIVATES THESE INDIVIDUALS.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.137
>> Sreenivasan: SO, A LOT OF

10:04.137 --> 10:06.940
THESE CASES HAVE MATERIAL

10:06.940 --> 10:08.241
SUPPORT AS ONE OF THE CHARGES

10:08.241 --> 10:08.842
THAT THEY HAVE.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.343
WHAT IS MATERIAL SUPPORT IN THIS

10:10.343 --> 10:11.110
DAY AND AGE?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.145
>> MATERIAL SUPPORT IS A VERY

10:12.145 --> 10:14.447
BROAD CATEGORY THAT IS USED MORE

10:14.447 --> 10:15.548
AND MORE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

10:15.548 --> 10:18.151
SINCE 9/11 FOR, IF YOU WANT TO

10:18.151 --> 10:20.353
GIVE... IT COULD BE ANYTHING

10:20.353 --> 10:21.821
FROM MONEY TO PROVIDING YOURSELF

10:21.821 --> 10:23.990
TO A FOREIGN CAUSE OF A

10:23.990 --> 10:25.191
DESIGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST

10:25.191 --> 10:26.292
ORGANIZATION.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.261
AND IT'S EXTREMELY BROAD, AND,

10:28.261 --> 10:30.029
THEREFORE, VERY POPULAR AMONG

10:30.029 --> 10:31.164
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.266
FOR SOME, IT'S OVERLY BROAD.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.000
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW, I

10:34.000 --> 10:35.001
DON'T HAVE TO BE AN A.C.L.U.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.337
LAWYER TO SAY THERE'S A SHIFT

10:37.337 --> 10:38.872
FROM REACTING TO TERROR ATTACKS

10:38.872 --> 10:41.508
TO PREVENTING TERROR ATTACKS,

10:41.508 --> 10:43.309
ENCROACH ON OTHER FREEDOMS OF

10:43.309 --> 10:45.311
HOW I WANT TO EXPRESS MYSELF.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.246
>> THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

10:46.246 --> 10:48.047
THE ISIS CASE IS THE QUESTION,

10:48.047 --> 10:49.849
ARE THESE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT

10:49.849 --> 10:52.886
FROM THE 550 PRIOR CASES OF

10:52.886 --> 10:54.821
TERRORISM-RELATED ARRESTS THAT

10:54.821 --> 10:57.023
WE SAW SINCE 9/11?

10:57.023 --> 10:58.758
AND TO SOME EXCEPT, THESE FEEL A

10:58.758 --> 10:59.826
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.160
AND YOU'RE RIGHT-- IF IT'S ABOUT

11:01.160 --> 11:02.795
EXPRESSION, IF IT'S ABOUT DOING

11:02.795 --> 11:04.330
VERY LITTLE, IF IT'S ABOUT BEING

11:04.330 --> 11:06.466
LED BY THE F.B.I. TOWARDS MANY

11:06.466 --> 11:09.035
PIECES OF THE INCIPIENT CRIME,

11:09.035 --> 11:10.103
THAT'S ONE THING.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.404
BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME

11:11.404 --> 11:13.840
KIND OF NEW ELEMENT HERE, A NEW

11:13.840 --> 11:15.108
FEELING, AND THAT'S WHY WE DID

11:15.108 --> 11:15.808
THE STUDY.

11:15.808 --> 11:16.543
>> Sreenivasan: AND ONE OF THE

11:16.543 --> 11:18.444
NEW ELEMENTS WAS SOCIAL MEDIA.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.580
SO MANY ARE LURED THROUGH SOCIAL

11:20.580 --> 11:21.414
MEDIA.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.515
I'M WONDERING, DOES LAW

11:22.515 --> 11:24.183
ENFORCEMENT USE THAT SAME SOCIAL

11:24.183 --> 11:25.652
MEDIA TO CATCH THEM?

11:25.652 --> 11:27.520
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO

11:27.520 --> 11:28.621
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.622
THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT USING

11:29.622 --> 11:30.924
SOCIAL MEDIA FOR A COUNTER-

11:30.924 --> 11:31.524
NARRATIVE.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.525
THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT USING

11:32.525 --> 11:34.360
SOCIAL MEDIA TO IDENTIFY THEM.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.228
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE

11:35.228 --> 11:36.696
COMPLAINTS, THEY POINT TO

11:36.696 --> 11:38.565
TWITTER, THEY POINT TO FACEBOOK,

11:38.565 --> 11:40.567
THEY POINT TO A VARIETY OF

11:40.567 --> 11:41.868
DIFFERENT APPS-- INSTAGRAM, FOR

11:41.868 --> 11:43.970
EXAMPLE-- AS WAYS THEY FOUND

11:43.970 --> 11:45.572
THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEN WERE

11:45.572 --> 11:47.073
ALERTED TO THEM AND BEGAN TO

11:47.073 --> 11:48.308
TRACK THEM AND FOLLOW THEM.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.676
SO, IT'S IMPORTANT BOTH IN THE

11:49.676 --> 11:50.610
RECRUITMENT AND IN THE

11:50.610 --> 11:51.778
DETERRING.

11:51.778 --> 11:52.478
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, KAREN

11:52.478 --> 11:53.479
GREENBERG, FORDHMAN CENTER ON

11:53.479 --> 11:54.581
NATIONAL SECURITY, THANKS SO

11:54.581 --> 11:55.448
MUCH.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.984
>> THANK YOU.

11:57.984 --> 11:58.751
>> Sreenivasan: LEARN MORE ABOUT

11:58.751 --> 12:00.853
HOW ISIS HAS USED SOCIAL MEDIA

12:00.853 --> 12:02.555
TO RECRUIT SUPPORTERS.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.770
WE CALL IT "CHASING THE DREAM."

12:17.770 --> 12:19.005
A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS

12:19.005 --> 12:20.707
THAT THE STRESS OF GROWING UP IN

12:20.707 --> 12:22.508
POVERTY CAN HAVE LONG-TERM

12:22.508 --> 12:24.611
EFFECTS ON CHILDREN'S BRAINS AND

12:24.611 --> 12:26.112
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.347
OUR STORY FOCUSES ON A PROGRAM

12:27.347 --> 12:28.615
IN CONNECTICUT THAT'S BECOME A

12:28.615 --> 12:30.149
NATIONAL MODEL FOR ADDRESSING

>> HOW WAS SCHOOL?

12:44.664 --> 12:45.832
>> GOOD.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.033
>> Reporter: RUTH, A 26-YEAR-OLD

12:47.033 --> 12:48.968
IMMIGRANT FROM HONDURAS, CHECKS

12:48.968 --> 12:50.937
IN WITH HER FOUR YOUNG KIDS, A

12:50.937 --> 12:53.773
NORMAL FAMILY SCENE; BUT, FOUR

12:53.773 --> 12:55.141
YEARS AGO, THE FAMILY WAS IN A

12:55.141 --> 12:56.909
VERY DIFFERENT PLACE.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.244
>> EVERYTHING WAS REALLY

12:58.244 --> 13:01.214
A DISASTER.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.281

13:02.281 --> 13:03.916
HOME MOM, LIVING ALONE WITH HER

13:03.916 --> 13:05.551
KIDS IN PUBLIC HOUSING.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.153
THE CHILDREN'S FATHER, A HOUSE

13:07.153 --> 13:08.154
PAINTER WHO SUPPORTED THE

13:08.154 --> 13:09.522
FAMILY, HAD GONE BACK TO

13:09.522 --> 13:11.057
HONDURAS.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.191
ONE NIGHT, WHILE THE CHILDREN

13:12.191 --> 13:13.960
WERE SLEEPING UPSTAIRS, BULLETS

13:13.960 --> 13:15.828
CAME FLYING THROUGH THE WINDOWS

13:15.828 --> 13:17.330
AND FRONT DOOR.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.565
>> EVERYTHING WAS BREAKING IN

13:19.565 --> 13:21.167
THE KITCHEN, THE GLASS AND THE

13:21.167 --> 13:23.169
MIRRORS AND EVERYTHING.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.805
EVERYTHING WAS LIKE A HORROR

13:25.805 --> 13:27.006
MOVIE.

13:27.006 --> 13:27.807
>> Reporter: IT WAS A RANDOM

13:27.807 --> 13:29.042
DRIVE-BY SHOOTING.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.176
RUTH'S CHILDREN WEREN'T

13:30.176 --> 13:32.011
PHYSICALLY HURT, BUT HER OLDER

13:32.011 --> 13:33.379
DAUGHTERS, ANDREA AND MICHELE,

13:33.379 --> 13:35.314
CAN'T SHAKE THE MEMORY.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.416
>> YEAH, I WAS SCARED.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.650
I WAS CRYING.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.052
>> I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.354
>> BECAUSE MY MOM, SHE COULD

13:41.354 --> 13:43.222
HAVE GOTTEN SHOT, TOO.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.757
SO, I WAS SCARED THAT SHE WAS

13:44.757 --> 13:46.192
GOING TO DIE.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.460
>> AND WE WOULD GO IN A FOSTER

13:51.631 --> 13:53.399
DRIVER'S LICENSE AND NO HIGH

13:53.399 --> 13:55.702
SCHOOL DIPLOMA, WAS SCRAPING BY

13:55.702 --> 13:57.470
ON CASH FROM HAVING SOLD THE TWO

13:57.470 --> 13:58.771
FAMILY CARS.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.740
RUTH MOVED IN WITH HER MOTHER.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.975
SHE AND THE FOUR KIDS SHARED ONE

14:02.975 --> 14:04.077
ROOM.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.546
>> I WAS REALLY SAD.

14:06.546 --> 14:10.883
HAVING THEM ALL TOGETHER AND

14:10.883 --> 14:13.453
SLEEPING ON ONE MATTRESS WAS

14:13.453 --> 14:14.954
MESSED UP.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.223
I FELT IT WASN'T FAIR.

14:17.223 --> 14:17.957
>> Reporter: SHE FELT LIKE SHE

14:17.957 --> 14:19.225
COULDN'T HELP HER KIDS,

14:19.225 --> 14:20.393
INCLUDING THE SECOND-OLDEST, WHO

14:20.393 --> 14:22.228
WAS BEING BULLIED AT SCHOOL,

14:22.228 --> 14:23.730
CRYING ALL THE TIME AND HIDING

14:23.730 --> 14:25.398
IN THE CLOSET.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.265
RUTH FELL INTO A DEEP

14:26.265 --> 14:27.533
DEPRESSION.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.402
>> EVERYTHING STRESS ME, I GET

14:29.402 --> 14:31.337
ANGRY EASILY, SO MY KIDS WERE

14:31.337 --> 14:32.271
LIKE THAT.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.673
THEY WERE SCREAMING AT EACH

14:33.673 --> 14:34.574
OTHER.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.242
THEY WERE FIGHTING A LOT.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.810
SO, I THOUGHT I WAS TRANSMITTING

14:37.810 --> 14:38.978
THAT TO THEM.

14:38.978 --> 14:39.245
>> Reporter: YOU WERE

14:39.245 --> 14:39.946
TRANSMITTING THAT.

14:39.946 --> 14:40.947
>> YES.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.315
>> Reporter: JACK SHONKOFF IS A

14:45.284 --> 14:46.552
CHILD.

HE SAYS STRESSFUL SITUATIONS

14:48.755 --> 14:50.990
PROVOKE A PHYSICAL RESPONSE.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.091
>> AUTOMATICALLY, OUR HEART RATE

14:52.091 --> 14:53.593
GOES UP, OUR BLOOD PRESSURE GOES

14:53.593 --> 14:56.496
UP, STRESS HORMONE LEVELS RISE

14:56.496 --> 14:57.764
IN THE BLOOD, OUR BLOOD SUGAR

14:57.764 --> 14:58.931
GOES UP.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.266
IT'S THE BIOLOGY OF THE "FIGHT

15:00.266 --> 15:02.402
OR FLIGHT" RESPONSE.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.336
>> Reporter: SHONKOFF SAYS, FOR

15:03.336 --> 15:05.338
CHILDREN, STRESS IS NORMAL AND

15:05.338 --> 15:06.873
FINE IN THE SHORT-TERM, BUT

15:06.873 --> 15:08.808
CHRONIC, LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO

15:08.808 --> 15:10.476
STRESS IS SOMETHING VERY

15:10.476 --> 15:11.410
DIFFERENT.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.413
HE CALLS THIS "TOXIC STRESS."

15:14.413 --> 15:16.349
SHONKOFF'S RESEARCH SHOWS TOXIC

15:16.349 --> 15:17.617
STRESS CAN HAVE PROFOUND

15:17.617 --> 15:19.385
