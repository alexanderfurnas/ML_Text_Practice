THAT?

05:04.600 --> 05:05.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THE ISSUE HERE

05:05.567 --> 05:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID

05:08.100 --> 05:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A VIDEO BEING

05:10.433 --> 05:11.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCED.

05:11.167 --> 05:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE

05:14.100 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON CAMPAIGN NOR ANYBODY

05:16.300 --> 05:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSE CAN POINT TO A VIDEO.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT THE

05:21.000 --> 05:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON CAMPAIGN TALKED ABOUT

05:22.433 --> 05:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH HAD SOME PEOPLE SAYING

05:23.967 --> 05:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ISIS WAS REFERRING TO

05:27.000 --> 05:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, BUT NO MENTION OF

05:28.867 --> 05:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A VIDEO.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY DO TRACK

05:31.933 --> 05:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS STUFF SAY IF DONALD TRUMP

05:35.233 --> 05:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD SHOWN UP IN AN ISIS VIDEO,

05:37.933 --> 05:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOTS OF PEOPLE WOULD BE TALKING

05:38.933 --> 05:39.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IT.

05:39.467 --> 05:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

05:40.967 --> 05:44.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE,

05:44.267 --> 05:46.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

05:46.067 --> 05:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THIS IS FALSE.

05:47.433 --> 05:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:54.900 --> 05:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:06.267 --> 06:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: NOW SHE SAID

06:07.333 --> 06:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT TRUE, WHO IS RIGHT

06:09.067 --> 06:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE?

06:09.433 --> 06:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> TO BE PRECISE, IN 2 THOUSAND

06:12.033 --> 06:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE WAS PUSHING HARD AND SHE WAS

06:14.900 --> 06:18.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKING ABOUT HAVING PHOTO

06:18.067 --> 06:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:19.767 --> 06:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUN OWNERS.

06:21.433 --> 06:26.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN IN 2008, SHE BACKED OFF

06:26.667 --> 06:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SAID NO, WE DON'T NEED THAT

06:29.633 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF LICENSING.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

06:34.133 --> 06:36.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU GOT TO KEY IN ON O'MALLEY

06:36.767 --> 06:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING NO FEDERAL STANDARDS.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON HAS NEVER BACKED WAY

06:40.600 --> 06:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM HAVING FEDERAL STANDARDS.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT PART OF HIS CLAIM IS

06:46.133 --> 06:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INACCURATE.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YOU CAN FIND THAT HILLARY

06:49.600 --> 06:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON HAS SHIFTED HER POSITION

06:51.467 --> 06:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BIT ON GUN CONTROL OVER THE

06:54.000 --> 06:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:24.167 --> 07:25.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER

07:25.267 --> 07:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR NOT HAVING A SINGLE PAYER

07:27.133 --> 07:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BUSINESS.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT WE CAN

07:37.067 --> 07:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT CHECK IS HIS BASIC MATH AND

07:38.667 --> 07:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NUMBERS THERE ARE VERY

07:41.100 --> 07:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WE'RE

07:43.433 --> 07:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT ABOUT PER CAPITA 3200

07:46.733 --> 07:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. DOLLARS PER PERSON, AND

07:49.533 --> 07:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN IN FRANCE, IT'S ABOUT

07:52.800 --> 07:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$4100.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

$8,700.

07:57.033 --> 08:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF IF YOU DO THE MATH, BERNIE

08:00.000 --> 08:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANDERS IS CORRECT, THEN THAT'S

WHAT WE DID.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
